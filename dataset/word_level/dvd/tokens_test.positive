best season yet i hve always loved vampire movies and books even wrote some but i have never been so captivated by a story arc well written well acted the relationship between angel and spike is so explosive it is hard not to choose sides the last battle well it has to be seen i keep hoping that mr whedon will give us a movie or mini series something that will continue this fantastic story the characters are too frightening too loveable too real to lose 
different but good entertainment this is an entertaining movie for sci fi buffs but still has a silly and comical kick to it as well 
good musical lot of good songs enjoyed it very much cant beat liza singing have yourself a merry christmas 
moe dvd is good but the same show on hdtv was better all it all i really enjoyed this capture of a moe event one thing i should note i have previously seen them on hd tv and recorded the show on my set top box the quality of the show on hd tv was is excellent particularly the video portion i then bought this dvd and discovered it was the same show i noticed to my surprise that the quality of the video on the dvd didn t hold a candle to the same show that i recorded off of hd tv it s not my gear since i have many rock shows on dvd that are of phenomenal video quality did someone at the production company cut costs on this disc seems like it to me still a great show buy it anyway 
entertainment and scholarship this film from th century fox albeit oboviously compressed in time offers a great opportunity for insight into the classic struggle of rome s movement from a republic to rule by dictatorship subtle references such as cleopatra s teasing of caesar s balding by referencing his cognomen nickname julius means full head of hair the burning of the great library of alexandria and the propaganda used by rullers of the time cleopatra claiming to be isis and caesar claiming to be related to venus through aeneas give opportunity for scholarship all the while being thoroughly entertained scenes like the death of pompey the mention of caesar s pride his th legion cleopatra s references to caesar s writings commentarii cleopatra s grand entrance into rome with her son caesarian the naval battle at actium between antony and octavian are all rich with generally accurate historical facts the latin word for school and fun are the same ludus i this cinema offers both 
a swallow a makes spring an admirable first feature film ok ok so the french title doesn t translate well but the rest of the movie sure enough does computer programmer and teacher sandrine played by mathilde seigner of venus beauty institute a year old parisienne decides to leave the city and make her odd albeit lifelong dream come true to become a farmer adrien aptly played by a very familiar yet aged michel serrault from such films as diabolique la cage aux folles i ii is an old and crusty goat farmer who half heartedly agrees to sell his land before his quickly approaching retirement days since adrien hasn t anywhere to live for the next months sandrine agrees to let adrien stay on in his homestead farmhouse for an extra year with her boundless energy sandrine takes over the farm and begins implementing her own innovations and city ways sandrine succeeds where adrien was sure she would fail she earns a good living in the spring and summer by opening up the farm making a bed and breakfast called balconies of the sky out of remodled barns to tourists elementary school field trips overnight guests and by selling her goat cheese over the internet however the quickly approaching winter changes tide and time and brings with it very conflicting emotions between the characters of adrien and sandrine sandrine faces the harsh isolation of the rhone alps but an odd but growing attachment to the ailing adrien are unexpected complications between curiosity and misunderstandings sandrine and adrien live side by side when the only thing they can truly share without letting each other know their true and genuine feelings for one another is their intense love for the mountains god s creatures and the beautiful and harsh mother nature nominated for cesar awards in france including best first feature film the girl from paris was a box office smash grossing over million us dollars the directorial debut of christian carion the film powerfully evokes the spectacular rhone alps the beauty simplicity and hardships of farm life taking chances and dealing with necessary sacrifices the ever present conflict between city and rural past and present and the neverending cycles of nature death birth and life highly recommended ! 
choices the opening scenes of a bakery and the violence that ensues draws you into a tangled tale of lust and survival not only does the director deal with difficult decisions he seeks to draw on your sympathy for all humans caught in the clutches of love as a young man runs from a bakery in fear of his life a bloody handprint starts to fade into the future we are taken into the present day as a woman and her husband walk home arguing about life and seemingly insurmountable problems instantly you can recognize giovanna s desire to be protected loved and desired she is unfulfilled and seeking adventure to be honest she is ripe for an affair mostly because her husband is not meeting her needs and seems to be lost in his own world of employment hell suddenly she is talking to the sidewalk because filippo is talking to an elderly gentleman davide who is suffering memory loss after taking him to the police station they all end up back and the noisy apartment complex where people hang their clothing out the window it is all so romantic then we notice the facing windows this becomes a focal point throughout the movie and is where most of the action occurs giovanna distrusts her husband s ability to look after the family but it actually turns out she distrust herself and must meet davide who will lead her to her destiny he shows her how to transform her hobby into her life the entire plot seems centered around choices people make to survive emotionally and physically we see flashbacks of davide s life and he also has many hallucinations due to his past experiences the eyes in this movie are especially revealing the director focuses on the eyes in many instances and the results are almost a terrifying intensity that i ve never seen in any movie the actors convey their emotions so well it was stunning there is one scene where filippo is feeling his life is completely inadequate and the look on his face almost made me cry because you could imagine a man feeling that inadequate and desperate to not only please his woman but provide for his family the cooking is especially wonderful and kitchen scenes and chocolate cakes dripping with dark chocolate icing are delicious moments in the movie in the end we can see this is a movie about two individuals trapped by circumstance and overwhelming choices do they make the right choices in the end oh the torment and the beauty i watched this four times in two days because this movie will take hold of your heart and i loved the kitchen scenes and giovanna lurking about in her dark kitchen looking into a life she wanted to live therebeccareviewcom 
masterpiece of the s this is one of my favorite s movie ! not only does it have the two infamous coreys but the plot keeps me intrigued still to this day ! 
a cool masterpiece it was really a pleasure to see this dvd and realise the renewed personalities of drummer roger taylor and guitarist brian may if you remember after that freddie passed away rip they were really in a dark gloomy mood i don t remember their tranquility and peace of mind in an interview since all happened years ago this dvd really is illustrative with an extensive analysis of the recording process song by song with roy thomas baker and brian may i don t know if it had would been better to add the comments of roy thomas baker about the making of bohemian rhapsody that appear in the magic years vol i special roger s drum demostration almost a clinic if you aren t a drummer with these tips you can understand better the roger taylor style with good introspective interviews and the reason of the john deacon s disappearing of the musical scene with people that lived the bankrup of the band in and finally the making of an extraordinary masterpiece the a night at the opera album it s interesting see the live footage and performances between one and another interview and a good example of this is the live track sweet lady from the dvd live at the hyde park good luck ! 
still scary this series was the best of its kind shown in original black and white the stories were great morality tales of the times as many of the stories dealt with cold war fears the music is still as creepy and scary as ever a major motion picture should have been made of this series as was done with the twilight zone 
quick and effective i just bought this one recently and tried it today for the first time i did the first two segments for a total workout of minutes its quick effective and gets your heart rate right up there there is very little warm up and no cool down to speak of of course with only minutes per workout you can t be cooling off half of that time so just reminding everybody here especially if you are new to working out to make sure to take the time to bring down your heart rate after you re done by walking in place and moving around do not stop moving until your heart rate has come back down to normal its great and effective i really enjoyed this dvd and i will be using it regularly 
my family i love this movie i read over some of the other people s opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it my kids ages loved this movie from start to finish the music the characters and the story were great for the entire family i definitely recommend this movie for your family s movie collection 
this is a must have for all the sherlock s fans out there you must watch it as a matter of fact you must watch all the dvds in the series i love the performation of jeremy he sometimes can be a little too dramatic nevertheless he was the only guy who really captured the essence of being sherlock holmes the maker of the series really put a lot of efforts in you can tell by the elegant design of the rooms and costumes even the smallest detail was paid attention to 
give it a chance some might pass over this movie because of of the material on abortion but i think that would be a mistake true there will never be a movie where they show the typical face of abortion women who have other options but don t take them but at least this film doesn t ram its views down your throat rather the story is a lot like the music gentle and relaxed moving at the pace of the wide eyed innocent homer i love lasse s movies anyway and wasn t disappointed with this one he brings you along without any high drama infusing things with a sweetness most directors pass over in favor of over the top action and dialogue give this movie a chance it s a deftly crafted piece with a slew of great performances a nice surprise 
i could not help myself from enjoying this movie a total surprise something must have appealed to me about new york minute for me to add it to my tivo list as someone who managed to miss all of the previous efforts by the twins it wasn t an attempt to capture any nostaligic feeling it wasn t also based on anything related to the story teens get mixed up in series of mishaps in big city has been done many times before such as elizabeth shue s adventures in babysitting you know what i think it was most possibly a clip of two totally hot looking blonde actresses lets face it they are and the chemistry and comic timing they seem to have together no high class art new york minute is not it s not the funniest movie out either but what is lacks in what some perceive as it flaws it makes up for with good natured fun yes this is a fun movie it s fun to see the two go from one misadventure to another initially with a mutual contempt that becomes a realization on the importance of family and family ties the movie features jane ryan ashley olsen a straight a uptight long island high school student who organizes her entire life around her day planner she s driven and ambitious and determined to win a scholarship to go study at oxford in england she has her speech pitch ready to be delivered in new york and seems as preapred as anyone could be but fate has a cruel twist in store for her enter her sister roxy played by mary kate olsen she s about as different from jane as possible roxy is with a rock band and acts with spontaneity that jane would find scary she also has made a habit of playing truant something that has brought her to the attantion of nassau co truancy officer max lomax played by comic genius eugene levy roxy is tasked with getting her sister to the train station but she has her own plans for the big city determined to deliver some demo tapes to record producers on hand for the videotaping of a new rock video so the two head for the big city with the bumbling lomax in hot pursuit through some crazy machinations they become entangled up with some music and video pirates including the hilarious andy richter as a goon who thinks he is chinese and the son of a u s senator and her dog and are soon running through the streets of new york city in little more than bath towels ive read a lot of reviewers on her dissing the acting of ashley and mary kate well it s true that they are not going to be winning any oscars for their roles here but they deliver their performances with an infectious enthusiasm that had be lapping up every minute of the movie i enjoyed it i simply could not help myself this movie comes recommended and i really didn t think it would be i surprised myself by enjoying every zany moment of it and those girls are too cute 
outsatnding film despair and rebirth this is one of the greatest films to come out of the uk in the past years that s saying quite a bit considering the number of high calibre films the uk has come out with in the past years there are numerous great reviews here on amazon therefore i will be brief i titled this as despair and rebirth what i mean by this is that the character mark renton ewan mcgregor finally comes to terms with his self destructive nature as a heroin addict and awakens to a new and better tomorrow and therefore gets a new lease on life a much better life moreover it is a new life that many of his friends never get in the film and the way the film depicts his life as a junkie along with his friends is nothing but depair you can t help feeling empathy for mark renton and you root for him to succeed in overcoming his terrible addiction this film is great because it does not gloss over the terrible and destructive nature of drug addiction and heroin in particular this film does not glorify drugs as one of the reviewers wrote on the contrary it gives the viewer the ugly truth about a life of addiction especially with the graphic scenes of how horrible the life of a junkie really is with the opening scenes dialogue of mark renton sarcastically mocking society as not the life he chooses to live to the end of the film s dialogue of his wanting to become part of society the viewer can understand his reasons because in between these two dialogues which serve as book ends the viewer witnesses the despair and horrible life that he lives and the comfort is in seeing that he has decided to take an alternate course a life without herion the entire film is great and highly recommended stars 
this may not be sparkling original but it s well executed there are many movies about sports some very good some really bad and this one falls into the very good category goal is the typical sports movie about an exceptionally talented young amateur who is given a chance to shine among the professionals and win the heart of the girl he loves however goal works this premise and makes it fresh and entertaining director danny cannon had complete support by fifa and newcastle united and it shows he has created some of the most realist and remarkable football scenes in film kuno becker is very good as santiago although at times he is overshadowed by other members of the cast it seems as if he lacked some presence on screen however he is still young and certainly will improve with the years alessandro nivola steals the movie with his performance as gavin a notorious football star whose convoluted public life begins to take its toll in his performance in the field cannons approach to the story may seem clichd but the movie is never boring nor tiresome sure he follows every rule in sport movies handbook but he does it with care good eye and love for the sport just like sport movies should be done the movie flows smoothly between remarkable football scenes and santiago s struggle with his own personal demons while at times it seems that both cannon and becker are more comfortable in sports scenes the movie s dose of drama is well handled and completes an enjoyable experience even though it s frankly predictable most of the time it transmits passion emotions and a love for the game that few movies do that s why goal can be considered a successful and important film it is the first film about football soccer that transmits the emotions that have made the sport to be the most popular sport in the world and that s got to be worth something it may not be a perfect sports film however goal is the beginning of an adventure and hopefully of a new way to make football movies this initial film of what is called the goal trilogy delivers high energy entertainment for fans and non fans of the sport 
a great tool to learn how to knit excellent dvd i thought i was knitting ok and then made myself sit down and watch all of this well i learned i was knitting wrong she even explains how we make the mistakes which is an important part to being able to see if you are knitting and pearling correctly you will be very happy with this choice if you are a new knitter 
so bad it s hilarious let s get one thing straight this is an ultra low budget movie with all of the trappings that come from that it s arnold schwarzenegger s first movie appearance and it shows so why does it get such a nice rating from me because the movie is so much fun to watch ! i ll be the first to admit this movie isn t for everyone but for those of you who enjoy a little camp now and then will truly get a kick out of hercules in new york lets start with the dubbing oh the wonderful dubbing arnold has been dubbed out of the movie and replaced by a voice that reminds me of a radio or tv personality the new voice is completely out of character with the way schwarzenegger looks it s great camp value i had the pleasure of checking out the included undubbed version with true arnold dialog trust me it s good they dubbed him i am hurkooleeeeze either dub you listen to will be very funny by the way the theatrical version for it s too perfect voice casting and the unedited version for arnold stumbling over the lines with little or no actual acting suprisingly enough some of the actual acting is quite good i particularly liked michael lipton as pluto arnold stang as pretzie and ernest graves as zeus schwarzenegger bless his heart just isn t up to par on this movie it s perfectly understandable as he just made the move from his body building career so he hasn t had the experience yet besides that s fun to watch too theres plenty more camp value where that came from sound effects can be out of place like when you hear car tires burning rubber while driving in the grass props are funny with things like zeus thunderbolts made from industrial galvanized steel rods and wait until you see the fight scene with the escaped bear sure they keep mixing up the names of greek gods with their roman counterparts sure stuff like serious cinematography and lighting were thrown out the window but as unforgivable those aspects are for many mythology and movie buffs i just can t help finish this movie with a smile on my face one final thing to mention is the music the opening credit score is extremely cheesy but when you actually get to the movie you are treated with some authentic greek music i mean the kind of music they play at traditional parties with mandolins and lutes it s really fun to listen while you see arnold romp around tossing people or things all over the place hats off to john balamos for the music in case you haven t noticed i love hercules in new york because it was done bad but with lots of style if you re not into campy movies then you probably won t enjoy it if you re a schwarzenegger fan with a sense of humor go rent it for everybody else it really depends on how forgiving you will be for all of the low budget fallacies i say check it out just for the experience alone just make sure you get the version with both the dubbed and the original arnold dialog and get the best bang for your buck 
great musician guitarist i just received the robben ford dvd yesterday i ve been a fan of robben s for over twenty years he s done stints as a guitarist with jimmy witherspoon charlie musselwhite joni mitchell the yellowjackets and the great miles davis to name a few as a guitarist myself i am awed by his talent and musicality he is often labeled as a fusion guitarist which is somewhat of a misnomer while quite fluent in the jazz medium he is at heart a bluesman once again this dvd is taken from the ohne filter german televison show the mixing and sound quality is great robben uses his band the blue line here it is a trio consisting of roscoe beck on bass and tom brecchtlein on drums both are superb musicians the show is from robbens playing is incredible and incedniary his voice while not quite on a par with his playing is pleasant and easy to listen to my only complaint is it s a bit short just eight songs but still well worth the price of the dvd if you are a fan of postmodern urban blues this dvd is a must have 
the action is the highlight mainly the movie follows the aftermath of the very successful video game final fantasy if you haven t played the game the movie will probably not make as much sense after the destruction of jenova there are still followers of sephiroth they make attempts to resurrect this classical villain cloud and his friends again step in to save the world there is some good voice acting and the action sequences are amazing ! there is a scene while cloud is fighting on a motorcycle with his big sword fighting two guys at once it is really something if you liked the video game and enjoy action sequences then i would recommend this to you if you have not played the game and do not like action sequences then you might not like it hope you find this helpful

a good introduction to french for toddlers i m pretty pleased with this title as my little one has managed to grasp a couple of french words he is only months yr mths but he understands and can utter a few french words and can now count from in french we are from malaysia therefore english and malay are our first two languages which my son already understands and converses in pretty well for his age i wanted to expose him to other languages so that is why i bought the french and spanish brainy baby titles i have yet to start him on the spanish title though its a good introductory dvd but i guess the only way you will get your children to be fluent in any language is to converse with them on a daily basis in the languages that you want them to be fluent in so basically i would recommend this dvd to parents who would like to expose their little ones to french i won t recommend it to parents who expect their little ones to be able to converse fluently in french by watching this dvd for that they should hire a french tutor 
dvd second posting received very shortly after first went missing ! very assuring that amazon attended to

great content mediocre context if you are willing to overlook the fact that the video is at times poor and the sound often uneven otherwise i d have given it stars then you are in for a great treat the sheer energy and enthusiasm of both the cast and audience is unmatched and the mis en scene is of a unique time forever gone new york city at the end the s about to shift into the skline is terrific routledge is great these two make the show watch for routledge s dramatics at the end of act kline s brilliant in his pirate king song and his antics in act ii during the paradox to away away scene are classic rose is the major general ronstadt is commendable any pop singer who tries their hand at operattic singing has my respect well maybe not michael bolton even smith is bearable a bit cheesy but what are you gonna do at least he doesn t seem to take himself all that seriously either although some liked the movie version better at least this production is in its entirety the movie stupidly leaves out a the end of the act finale after oh happy day and the second versus of a policeman s lot and sighing softly it also resurrects the major general reprieve lyrics at the end of act ii originally used by gilbert for the new york premiere which typically don t get included but actually tie up the show perfectly and an added bonus is the use of the matter patter song from ruddigore with slightly changed lyrics kline does the last verse in one breath ! so take it for what it is a great performance intermittently marred by sub standard video audio production 
watch it even if you never watched it on tv i never watched the apprentice when it was on tv i thought i wouldn t like it because i am not into business or donald trump but i ended up checking it out from my library just to see what the big stink was about and i was hooked ! i watched it all weekend one episode after the other i had to know what happened ! i loved the challenges given to the contestants it was fun to see how they would work through them plus there is plenty of personal conflict and drama great show 
you will be entertained this is a very entertaining film that explores many of the situations that young adults must master on their way to understanding themselves and their goals in life primarily this means how to balance work demands and the demands of family and friends i personally think that the years following college graduation and the first successes and failures in business help a young adult clarify their values and the path or direction they wish to take their life in this regard the devil wears prada is right on the money anne hathaway does a great job playing recent college graduate andrea who takes a job as second assistant to a highly demanding supervisor meryl streep as editor miranda priestly does a superb job of playing a driven workaholic creative power broker in the fashion industry strep s performance was captivating yet not over the top she never was a cartoon witch just incredibly demanding and self absorbed the fact that meryl streep can take a character that is totally unique and bring out the vulnerable human qualities attests to her superior acting skills watching streep play the machiavellian diva is worth the price of the dvd so what happens to little innocent andrea she gradually takes the challenge of trying to please the totally unpleasable miranda she gradually masters her job and the field of fashion she also gradually begins to edge out first assistant emily blunt blunt is also superb as she trys to imitate her hateful boss yet always a softer side comes through handsome daniel sunjata plays a young designer dependent on miranda s good graces and opionion he is willing to change an entire line of his designs to please her simon baker as a jet set journalist stanley tucci as miranda s second in command and adrian grenier as anne s college boy friend nate all allow andrea to see herself as other see her and as she is gradually becoming andrea is almost lost until she discovers that miranda s position is in jeapardy and she comes to the loyal defense of a woman most folks consider to be a monster but miranda was already aware of the coup and is willing to double cross her second in command to remain in power andrea gets a glimps into the driven inside dynamics of miranda and at some point realizes she doesn t want this future even if she may have the instict and brains for such a world in the end andrea makes the right moves she does not fall for the chaos and competition and gets her life and love back you will remain entertained by the beautiful cast hathaway and streep s superb performances and the stunning designer clothes hathaway shows us throughout the second half of the film

the parallax view is a great paranoid thriller from the watergate era when this movie came out the watergate scandle was in full bloom and no one trusted the goverment anymore i mean the president was make up the rules as he went along and that was one reason that all the thrillers of that time are so paranoid in this film beatty plays a reporter at the time almost all the heros were reporters because we though that they were the only people we could trust who along with other reporters sees a senator assassinated and soon notices that all the people who saw it are dieing in accidents now in fera of his life beatty must find out what is going on and what the parallax corp has to do with this and other deaths and assassinatens once he starts to look into in we quickly see that our man is in way over his head and is now a prime target himself and it looks like he s being framed for something this is really a great movie and the ending is part of that great s beleaf that the little man stood no chance aganist the big boy of wealth and power if you like some meat in your thrillers this one is for you ! 
body snatchers first let me say contrary to popular belief this movie was not shot in a widescreen format it was cropped into a widescreen format by the studio before release having said that this movie remains a fine piece of s si fi highly enjoyable great pic on the dvd as well 
well done john goodman s role is so realistic that i thought i was seeing the babe many times ! he is outstanding in his role as babe ruth hollywoood liberties sure but an excellent story and a look at an baseball hero a must for baseball fans 
ever get the feeling you re being watched the magic of a coen brothers film is that you never know what to expect and you can slowly go insane trying to categorize what exactly their cinematic messages are never has this idea been more apparent than in barton fink throughout this moody homage to s and s cinema john turturro s fink rants and raves with his pretentious and arrogant speeches while never really allowing himself to soak in the true everyman quality that he claims to possess fink is left with only questions not answers as rich and wonderful as the script to barton fink is watching it has a truly unique and mysterious effect we are constantly presented with haunting imagery ambiguous character developments and riddles galore as barton has sex with audrey we get treated to a long and painful camera shot that leads us down a sink drain whilst moans and gasp echo from above this shot shows us in painstaking yet quiet detail barton s sexual repression and the way he views all other mortals in comparison to himself the walls in barton s apartment slowly peel away oozing with slime and further handicapping his writing efforts the ominous picture of the lady on the beach that constantly beckons barton giving him a painful ache of deja vu barton s room is a character in itself and each movement he makes causes a reaction that seems to stem from deep inside his imagination as always though he s too arrogant to understand anyone else around him and the answers that so allude him prove to be right under his nose enter his good natured neighbor charlie this relationship is fascinating as with each subsequent visit charlie grows deeper into barton s head the first meeting where barton complains about the noise is awkward and hard to watch as barton is so busy pontificating about the good of the common man that he fails to listen to real trials and tribulations of the common man that stands right before him as time goes by though we begin to sympathize a bit more with barton as he actually listens more intently to what charlie has to say of course this all blows up in barton s face as we begin to learn that charlie isn t all he is shaped up to be when charlie offers barton the mysterious box and later when we learn that charlie has an affinity for lopping off heads in his spare time we begin to suspect what might just be in this box but clueless barton still has no idea what could possibly be inside as he continues to struggle with not only his writers block but his overall mental block as well when the woman on the beach asks him what s in the box he simply replies i don t know this ending brilliantly summarizes what barton has been dealt in life and that if we were presented with the contents of the box it would completely diminish all of the fascinating quirks and mysteries laid throughout the film part of the fun of this film is reveling in the conceit that what we see as viewers doesn t necessarily mean that barton sees it too one great and perhaps more obvious example is when barton goes dancing and begins screaming at the sailors this is how i serve the common man ! as he points at his head this is my uniform as hilarious and agonizing as it is to watch poor barton just never gets it the greatest irony in the movie for barton is his misunderstanding of what is expected of him from capitol pictures the coen s couldn t have presented a more everyman quality as good old fashioned family fun like going to the movies even with such a simple task as writing a b movie about stout wrestlers barton drowns in a river of his own self importance and all other things that confound his sanity stem from this one basic premise when looked at this way the riddles and ambiguities in this film aren t mysteries at all only devices to further confound barton and separate any connection that we may begin to feel with the main character when the film was released director joel coen said where would it get you if something that s a little bit ambiguous is made clear it doesn t get you anywhere which in itself is a riddle of sorts barton fink is a rare exercise in truly alternative film making methods nothing is left explained and it s up to the viewer to form their own unique interpretation and unwind the riddles that aren t as difficult as they seem if we just allow ourselves to not enter into barton fink s world of pretentious musings and closed mindedness as barton begins to touch down into w p mayhew s and audrey s world he asks what don t i understand in the film barton fink this question is precisely the point 
my name is tina turner and my husband and i have had an argument i have cents in my pocket if you give me a room i promise you i will pay you back as soon as i can and if this powerful scene of a battered and bruised tina turner from the hands of ike turner fleeing to a nearby hotel a star performer known throughout the world with only change in her pocket doesn t move you then you just don t get it angela bassett won golden globe and naacp image awards for her portrayal of tina turner in the release that was based on the best selling autobiography i tina laurence fishburne turns in a fantastic performance as ike turner the movie follows the life of anna mae bullock from nutbush tennessee to st louis where she meets ike turner and to what appeared to be a charmed life of international music stars but success came with a harsh price for tina turner as her popularity grew ike turner became physically and verbally abusive fueling this cowardly anger with cocaine he openly flaunted his affairs while being surrounded by a group of enablers who said nothing as long as the party never stopped tina turner finally finds the courage to leave the relationship and rebuild her shattered personal professional life the final scene brings even more powerful meaning to the song what s love got to do with it which streaked to number one in the billboard hot chart on september a man like ike turner who physically and mentally abuses a woman is a sick bully and coward in the divorce proceedings though tina turner agreed to sign away any claim to future record royalties and publishing rights to their music ike turner who played a bizarre victim card also wanted her stage name claiming that name s got my daddy s blood written all over it he was so wrong it wasn t his daddy s blood written all over it anna mae bullock got to keep the name that she made even more famous as a solo artist author and perhaps most importantly as a woman who showed the fortitude to leave an abusive relationship and take control of her life 
well there was a ton of hoopla over this movie and i just don t get it it is okay a decent modern film i just don t think it was so great

please enter a title for your review contains spoilers nothing horrifying in this movie episode the one bloody scene is visually downplayed but it s an original relationship drama the main character ida talks in a robotic voice which i didn t get used to until halfway through the other four key characters are her fratboy laboratory co worker who she gets along well with their conflicting personality types never made into an issue her conservative landlady the landlady s granddaughter and her new girlfriend misty whose arrival co incides with that of a mysterious bug which was intended to keep ida and misty apart but ends up bringing them closer together when it impregnates both of them how sweet 
moscow does not believe in tears this movie shows the classic of russian history people interested in russian culture should definately watch this movie the plot of the story is really interesting 
excellent movie i have to admit that i cried like a baby at the end of this movie this was probably one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen i would recommend it to anyone even if you aren t really that into history 
the next set of pony collections well they ve finaly released the next set of the my little pony collection this dvd holds new stories which include flight to cloud castle somnambulaspikes search the icecream wars the prince and the poniesthese new stories continue your collection from the complete first season if thats what your looking for i am a big my little pony fan so this dvd really is worth it and completed my colletion along with the other realese they had the quest for the princess ponies dvd if your a big fan as well go for it 
please do adjust your set to this the please adjust your set dvd set is a worthwhile purchase on several levels watching the episodes that comprise the set you can see what idle jones palin brought to monty python in fact when i was watching the sketchs many of them seemed like dry runs for later monty python sketches the other worthwhile aspect to this set is seeing the bonzo dog band w viv stanshall in their s glory although i have heard that the bonzos have recently got back together are touring england w worthies such as stephen fry there is nothing that can quite replace the absurd brilliance of vivian stanshall to me watching the bonzos perform on video on this set is like finding video footage of ancient egyptians walking around the pyramids you get glimpses of what the bonzos would have been like when they played live the fact that this set is in glorious black white instead of dull drab color gives it an almost victorian patina from a time which is as distant from today as the s were in the s this is a very entertaining set especially for fans of british rubbish erm humor or should i say humour 
another excellent er season i started watching er while on vacation a few years ago i d come in from the beach crash on the couch and get invovled when i found they had come out on dvd i bought the three series that are available although i have not yet completed series it s proving to be just as enjoyable as the previous two what we need are the rest of the series to be released on dvd too i see series is available in the uk but not here what gives with warner bros if you enjoyed the earlier series get series too and place your order with amazon for series hopefully if enough of us do that then amazon can get wb to go burn some discs 
the best twice over this is a stellar version of a beautiful book my very favorite in fact like most people i am most often very disapointed when novels i love are adapted to the screen this film is one of the rare exceptions faithful to the book beautifully shot expertly casted ralf fiennes is the perfect heathcliff brooding morose obssesive magnetic jelous on an almost demented level juliet binoche is kathy flawlessly wild and determined together their chemistry is explosive jason riddington s performance as hareton earnshaw is heart breaking this alone makes the movie worth watching my only complaint and it s a small one is that juliet binoche plays both kathy earshaw and katherine linton it s slightly disconcerting not to say she doesn t play it well it s just a little hard to buy however it doesn t really hurt the story this is all and all a fabulous treat of a film whether you love romance historical or dramatic films it s perfct 
fast times indeed one of the classic high school movies fast times spawned a slew of teenage talent on the big screen but no one was more memorable in this movie than sean penn as spicoli amy heckerling cuts out a slice of southern californian life from a san bernardino high school that shows both honor students and misfits alike while the signature moments belonged to spicoli there were many other great scenes such as the ongoing burger war in which judge reinhold finds himself on the short end of the spatula meanwhile his little sis a seemingly innocent jennifer jason leigh experiments with dating and sex with an amusing pair of misfits brian backer and robert romanus phoebe cates tries to set her young prodigy straight but to no avail forest whitaker even has a significant moment in this movie as the bruising defensive lineman who takes out the destruction of his prized car on the opposing team little did he know that spicoli had a hand in it but it is the hilarious relationship between spicoli and mr hand ray walston that steals the show fast times may appear a bit dated but it hasn t lost any of its humor 
a bloodsucking love story who would believe you can make a hero out of a killer vampire well francis ford coppola made sure we did in this horrific love story you want dracula to get away with murder and rape one of the best movies ever made a great story and the direction is supperb the cast is full of stars that were then on the rise keanu reeves gary oldman winona ryder except for long time star anthony hopkins who plays a sarcastic intense van helsing a must have for every coppola lover 
the most inspirational movie i ve seen this year when the football team from from shiloh christian academy goes on the field to face the unbeatable giants the opposing team the first football player that confronts the giants is named joshua i love it in exodus joshua was moses successor and the one who eventually led their people into the promised land despite the very scary reports of all those giants theres another scene where a character is driving away in a shiny red truck and the license plate on the truck says jay austin motors which was the name of the used car lot in flywheel it is details such as this the little things that make this movie such a treasure and it s also the realism like flywheel the actors and actresses are real they look real and sound real and their dialogue is also deliciously real there are no words to express how delighted i am to see these christian films getting their due they re low budget but well produced and interesting they re quiet nothing explodes and there are no grisly murder scenes yet they re completely engaging and their message is compelling and memorable and perhaps best of all it shows men and women down on their knees praying to god and giving their lives wholly to her or him depending on your perspective throughout the movie i was touched really and truly touched by the portrayal of our deep human need and longing to feel god s presence in our life and give ourselves wholly to her and on a more secular note it s interesting to note that this movie was made on a budget perhaps the heyday of hollywood is drawing to a close we can hope 
top notch entertainment i could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot story of this movie is about or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film and find out that way most of you probably know it by now as it is a few good men is on my and my wife s list of top ten movies of all time with plenty of good reasons as it has been said in many other reviews the acting in this film from all the supporting actors as well is excellent the story is good too very interesting actually it would be easy to look at this movie as simply a blockbuster kind of movie which essentially it is it s got a list talent in front of and behind the camera it made a hell of alot of money at the box office so yes it s a blockbuster but it s also a damn good story as mentioned before another thing i liked about this movie was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between tom cruise and demi moore s characters something most other films on this scale would have done and i know it s been said in many other reviews but i m going to say it again anyway jack nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie no not because of that famous you can t handle the truth line but because his acting really is that good it seems so natural his mannerisms are so natural that he could pass for a real life military leader i am in the military myself so i can vouch for this and even though this movie is over two hours i was never once bored you won t be either 
not too easy not too hard easy to follow not a lot of chatter it really works you out intermediate level great workout wow 
amazing this is one of my favorite movies ever it really captures life in the s slums and you really get attached to the characters there are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters this is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams i ve seen this movie about times and each time i see it it is just as good 
homicide profiling by psychologist an excellent series if a little gruesome in the crime pictures after that it is an interesting interplay between the regular british police and the absent minded professor type role of the psychologist well acted and excellent scenery set mostly in the north of england 
good movie the action in this movie is amazing the idea behind the movie is great actors are great this movie is great as a date movie 
better than average suspense film boy there are a lot of jaded really picky film fans out there i don t understand why this movie got slammed so much but maybe my standards are not very high whatever i enjoyed this story of the oily stranger who wins the heart of the mother endangers the son and brings the father exhusband to the rescue no it s not original but i found it pretty scary and very well done by both travolta and vaughn teri polo didn t have much to do for most of the film but she did it acceptably and the young actor who played danny was fine in all i found this to be a much more involving suspense tale than many i have seen and i would recommend it without reservation 
five stars with reservations medium is a very good adult audience supernatural suspense series the show is mostly convincing with a stellar performance on the part of ms arquette and most of the supporting cast is excellent it is unfortunate that the part of mr dubois who is supposed to be a rocket scientist is so unsympathetic and seems to be a bit slow now i am aware that many gifted mathematicians have a missing element socially but the real mr dubois in interview does not seem so however in sweet dreams episodeala its a wonderful life joe is what you would hope he would be for the rest of the series so go figure the children of the show are a mixed bag but talented child actors are few and far between the crimes that are solved are not family friendly but the show is about half about the family dynamic of their unique situation which makes for pretty good drama my reservations notwithstanding one of the recurring bad guys in the show is an evil spirit that is the source for psychosis in mentally ill criminals i don t like the inference but it is an interesting proposal that being said this show is fascinating if you can accept that the real allison dubois is truly anything like purported in the show 
misunderstood yet brilliant and still accurate film when the idiotic tv pundits talk about this film they always make it sound like it s this perfect isnt america wonderful film that doesn t criticise our country in any way i have heard numerous times when pundits rally against current hollywood and their supposedly antiamerican practices they always site this film as a great expression of how wonderful and perfect america is obviously they did not see the film the senators representatives governors and their ilk are portrayed as cynical corrupt individuals and sadly that s still true today when jefferson smith is appointed he s like a naive schoolboy he knows more about us history than all of washington does but when he learns how corrupt washington is he refuses to be a stooge and decides to stand up for himself then the political machines come down on him instead of going away he fights back which leads to the famous filibuster scene this is a great film but it is not the naive film the pundits suggest it s a sadly accurate portrayal of our political system it s actually more realistic than an episode of the west wing the characters in this film are pretty accurate as opposed to the silly idealistic naiviete on the west wing the dialogue is wonderful all of the performances are superb and capra s direction are excellent notice that capra doesn t cut as much as modern directors do the film is still pretty fast but would be considered slow by today s standards a great american film one that probably couldn t be made today let s hope that they don t remake this they already did with billy jack goes to washington which was one of the worst films i ve ever seen 
not just for fans of sexy pinoys this flick surprised me i was expecting acting along the lines of macho and midnight dancers but these guys are really talented what really impressed me is how universal gay emotions and personalities are these guys could have been my friends down the street from me here in honolulu working through the exact emotions intelligently made with attention to detail the quality is surprisingly good considering it was made with non industry standard equipment i found myself talking outloud to the main character it really hit a sensitive spot for me i have certainly been in his shoes buy a copy and support this project looking forward to future projects from this guy 
smarter than you might think watch the seventh seal by ingmar bergman and you ll appreciate the quotbattlequot with death even more 
great but disturbing in somse scenes i have children in the performing arts and i wanted them to to get a taste of the reality of a full time school and the harshness of competition in such schools the movie was great for that but some of the r rated scenes were even hard on me i do not know if i will watch the movie again soon as a presentation of what it s like to enter one of these firecely competitive schools it was very good and as a sober revealer of how much anger disappointment and immorality there is in such a society it was great it was a much rougher version of step up the movie for parents considering putting their kids into performing arts high schools it s probably informative and not too far off i would rate it pg to r for language and sexual insinuations 
a fine giallo the opening ten minutes are a little rough with an overdose of crash zooms distorting lenses clunky dialogue and poor model work after the first story twist however the film becomes a superior giallo worthy of comparison with bava and argento director sergio martino stages some strong set pieces displaying a visual flair only hinted at in the strange vice of mrs wardh it s possible dario argento saw scorpion s tail before making deep red as some scenes are remarkably similar check out the murder in the theatre there s even a bold female reporter who helps unmask the killer at great personal risk while deep red is the better film argento owes martino a debt or two george hilton is a solid lead is it his own voice on the italian soundtrack and spaghetti western regular luigi pistilli adds a touch of class in a rare good guy role the plot twists are satisfying though the photo blow up trick was well parodied by mel brooks in high risk 
i hope this helps this is a very good movie do no listen to anybody inless they have star reviews cause this is a very good movie 
watched in social studies first of all i loved this movie ! it was so realistic and didn t have a sappy love story part it was pure battle and made you feel like you were involved when i saw my teacher pull the tv into the room i was just like ok time for me to do other homework but that homework never got done i was so wrapped up in the movie it was amazing 
perfection this dvd is obviously homoerotic tasteful artistic and reveals the comfort level these men have regarding their sexuality and nudity this comes recommended for anyone who is interested in the perfection of the male form 
perfect romance the movie sends chills and hots all over you and tears will not be surprising the painter and the girl and bussave are entangled in a search for self expression and freedom that comes with the final release which is the probably death of the girl the very deep and true meaning of search is beautifully expressed by long walks and no talk most especially among the painter and the girl go for it and feel the dark pull of passion and violence 
must have for broadway lovers i saw this show on pbs and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on i don t know of any other way to be able to see yul brynner s commanding king and i performance loved it 
a dead man goes to war the true story of the british attempt to lay some heavy disinformation on the axis in world war ii clifton webb plays lt cmdr ewen montagu the british naval commander who is both mastermind and chief promoter of the plan an elaborate concoction of forged papers misleading faux orders a convincing back story and a suitable corpse meant to mislead the enemy about the allied intentions prior to the invasion of italy i don t suppose it s giving too much away to report that things more or less go as planned although the suspicious germans do send spy stephen boyd in to liven up the last third of the film even though this is indeed a war movie bang bang stuff the man who never was practically wallows in minute details while eschewing the firefight and the foxhole that s not to say it doesn t have its share of situational suspense are those depth charges going to sink the sub and scuttle the movie but detail is much preferred over violent action along with the likes of monty woolley webb more or less cornered the market on playing stuffy condescending englishmen here webb s strength a stiff and rather formal persona who needs a baby sat seven yearold to evoke his humanity is put to good use there are no kids around and webb doesn t unbend but this movie doesn t care that much about the personal life of its characters anyway save for poor gloria grahame who s given the rather thankless task of shedding some plot directed tears and seems rather out of place for her troubles even though it s clinical and relatively bloodless in every sense of the word the man who never was is a great deal of fun director ronald neame lovingly dwells on every step of the preparation through to the execution of the caper and has us deeply involved when the whole thing is threatened with the appearance of the boyd character the man who never was is a fine thoughtful film that should appeal to those who aren t necessarily great fans of action war movies 
oh those randy mexicans a translation of the title of this movie into english would yield something like and your mother too which would echo a phrase often used in so called mother talk or wolfing if you re gonna wolf you better wolf fast cause your old lady s got a face like a bulldog s ask me no questions and i ll tell you no lies having been brought up in the united states and having attended the public schools i am no stranger to the phenomenon of teenaged boys being teenaged boys having been there and done that myself including the hazy sunny obligatory motor trip to tijuana and points south but what struck me while watching this fascinating film was how very like the guys i went to school with are tenoch and julio in fact i was a little reminded of the song me and julio down by the schoolyard by paul simon not much would have to be changed to see this as an american movie about young people in america near the end of the th century but this is about mexico and it takes place in mexico and even though julio and tenoch rag on team america there is no doubt that their lives and the styles they copy and take as their own are enormously influenced by american culture for better or for worse gael garcia bernal who previously starred in alejandro gonzalez inarritu s amores perros plays julio who is from a middle class family diego luna plays his friend tenoch named after tenochtitlan aztec founder of mexico city who is the son of a prominent mexican politician both boys live the kind of lives of plenty and privilege that the average mexican can only dream about and so there is a certain decadent and hedonistic quality to the way they embrace life but what director alfonso cuaron captures with these boys and their adventure to an imaginary beach with an older woman is the zest of youth that throws itself wildly and madly into sex drugs and the search for experience and the fulfillment of youthful urges what they learn from luisa maribel verdu is something most young men really lust after that is how to please a woman sexually well at least they experience a first course cuaron shows us teenaged boys as teenaged boys are raunchy randy irreverent and as a old army sergeant used to say young and dumb and full of you knowwhat well not dumb both boys are sharp and quick to learn about life and as the movie ends and they go their separate ways we know that both will go on to college and make a good life for themselves in this sense this is a coming of age movie with lusia as mentor to the boys looking at the movie a little more deeply we have to ask why does lusia go on the trip with tenoch and julio and why does she let herself go so to speak we learn that her husband has cheated on her again by the way and had the temerity to call her up immediately after the fact and confess later we learn that she has an even more compelling reason to indulge herself in a youthful fling but of course you should see the movie to find out what that is the sense of freedom and naturalness that cuaron captures not only in the area of human sexuality but in the spirit of a vast country moving from a largely agrarian society to an industrial one and the bewilderment that such rapid change makes people feel is made especially vivid by the focus on the young since they are the ones moving the fastest of course this focus doesn t hurt at the box office since young people make up the bulk of viewers in mexico as elsewhere however despite what some reviewers have suggested this movie addresses mexican poverty in only a token way this is a movie about privileged mexicans who could as i intimated above pass for americans or europeans with only a minor cultural shift be forewarned that the sexuality shown here is about as graphic as any you ll see this side of an x rating which is okay with me certainly it is better than the usual violence that hollywood serves up in fact i hope this movie triggers a change in the movie industry away from the belief that you have to titillate the mass audience with violence in order to be successful sex will do just fine bottom line a vital vivid romp that will delight especially the young clearly this is not a movie for prudes or social conservatives and that s an understatement

funny movie this is one of my favorite movies i ve watched it for years on cable and finally decided to buy the dvd it stars the great john candy and the late richard crenna it s a fun movie to watch ! 
mrs miniver dvd review received the dvd in perfect condition and within the expected time indicated when purchased very pleased would purchase again 
an important american film but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one and alpha video the distributors of this classic capra movie made no attempt to clean it up here we have an example of a key artwork about america s psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the s crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves 
inside tinseltown i used to think that actors made up their own lines remarks a casual acquaintance movie screen writer dixon steele retorts when they get to be big stars they usually do this dvd was quietly released in without any fanfare there should have been some nicholas ray s powerful direction of s in a lonely place is a gaunt inspection of inside hollywood complete with ruthless studio bosses boozy actors on theskids and one motion picture screen writer who s fed up with it all dixon steele meets a young girl at his favorite restaurant and invites her home to read a story he s considering adapting for a movie the girl is pretty but it s just business to him she s seen leaving his hollywood apartment by his quiet neighbor laurel when the girl is found murdered the next day the police naturally want to talk to the bad tempered wild living dixon steele did he fly offthehandle again and knock off the girl humphrey bogart stars as dixon steele flush from success in the late s bogart had set up his own film production company santana productions and was releasing movies through columbia in this period santana made three films in a row two were real stinkers but in a lonely place is now film classic humphrey bogart still in his prime had perhaps the role of a lifetime yes he was great in casablanca but here as steele nothing is held back like bogart himself the character of steele is acerbic raw and violent a brawler in real life bogart wasn t afraid to illuminate his darker side in a gutsy portrayal of a neurotic almost psychotic reprobate ray s direction is flawless and this is his finest work its even better than his marvelous rebel without a cause his wife at the time gloria grahame co stars as laurel the neighbor a fine cast includes robert warwick frank lovejoy morris ankrum myron healey and in a small part jack webb the dvd is spotless with a dolby digital track extras include in a lonely place revisited a featurette on restoration and a bogart photo montage just a few years later bogart s health would decline and meaty roles would become somewhat rare but here just before that happened is an electrifying performance by a motion picture icon at the top of his game a quality dvd a great story and amazing multi level theater i think i m going to watch it all again 
perhaps the perfect date movie i really enjoyed tristan isolde in fact much more than i thought i might the performances were all excellent especially those of james franco rufus sewell and the radiant sophia myles the period details and production design were quite well done best of all the script dealt with such big themes as love honor duty and even redemption but not in a heavy handed fashion i had recommended tristan isolde to a friend who likes jane austen novels the movie has that sort of grand sweeping romanticism she would probably like coupled with enough sword fights and action scenes to keep the boys in the audience entertained as well in other words this is perhaps the perfect date movie 
great for teaching music drama us history i hate musicals this one is tolerable because it is so rich in history my th graders love it they really get into it once it gets started they realize that they know who all the characters are and what they are doing inh the film i think it is great to use along with the book a more perfect union by betsy maestro it really moves the whole process of creating a nation into the real world for them 
nail on the head i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson i had never really seen topher grace outside of that s show which i never kept up with on a regular basis i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd mr grace plays a year old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend he s become such a machine in a competivie world that he s loses his way in life i was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too one of mentor s has told me repeatedly that the mid twenties can be one of the roughest times in life so many things are going at once on so many levels to me this movie captured that paul weitz did a great job writing this the cast was exquisite 
great concert footage and music haven t seen this since it was in the theaters almost years ago this is an excellent concert dvd the documentary footage is the usual rockumentary stuff going to graceland and seeing elvis s grave and talking deeply about the meaning of the music which the band actually mocks and laughs about doing but the music and seeing u in their prime as this monolithic juggernaut of musical talent charisma and stage performance is just magical the music is great and bono is the air apparent to the thrown of savior of rock and roll he is the man one highlight that was not actual concert footage is them working with b b king also love the beginning charles manson stole this song from the beatles we re stealin it back as an intro for helter skelter the first half is in black and white for all the new songs that they were introducing then when they get to most of their big hits in the second half it is in color 
oddly shaped beings my son had never heard of these characters neither had i for that matter and he wasn t really interested in watching the dvd s after watching the first one the pilot episode he said it was lame with preditable stupid jokes soon after he had watched everything else he tried this set again and proclaimed the rest of the episodes to be awesome so it s a hit in our house 
a tradition in our home it s a ritual for my year ld daughter and her dad to watch samurai jack before bed back when she was and it was played on cartoon network they made sure to watch it together now that cartoon network is retarded and they don t play it anymore i ve bought seasons and i just wish it was played on cartoon network like it used to be jill henrichse 
what a charade cary grant audrey hepburn a hidden megafortune three nasty pursuers a slick chic thriller with a hitchcockian edge with that kind of formula it s not surprising that charade deserves every shred of praise it receives and over the years this classic has received a lot director stanlet donen had his finest moment when he created this funny witty tightly plotted little thriller where you re left with questions right up to the final scene while on vacation at a ski lodge regina lampert hepburn decides to get a divorce but when she returns home she finds that her husband has been tossed off a train and even stranger she finds that he was mixed up in a gold robbery many years ago to get her mind off her problems reggie goes out on the town with peter joshua grant a guy she met at the resort but during her outing she s cornered by three strange creepy men and the worst part is she finds that joshua may be in on their plot unsure whom to trust reggie starts digging to find out where the gold is and then her pursuers are murdered one by one will she be the next target its a sharp taut little thriller reminiscent of the more commercial thrillers by hitchcock though set in a chic s paris setting and with a new wave edge stanlet donen did mostly comedies in his career which makes the tight plot and wry wit of this movie stand out even more the movie moving along at a fairly steady pace with one or two dead spots but mostly just following the twisted plot threads there are some really harrowing moments like regina being attacked by the hook man by the tense finale a lot of the odd little clues suddenly fall into place especially the murder of the three thugs it s a brilliant piece of scripting even if the storyline is a bit unreal fortunately it s not all spy thrills and revenge donen could change from action to horror to comedy in a moment and he keeps the quieter moments lively with funny dialogue and some sophisticated slapstick like grant showering fully clad the witty dialogue is full of glorious one liners you won t be able to lie on your back for awhile reggie quips but then you can lie from any position though grant wasn t wholly comfortable playing opposite hepburn the two actors have kinetic chemistry whether they re goofing off or chasing a kiss in a nightclub they feel entirely real and romantic better yet nobody knows who grant really is or what he s doing so there s an added element of danger to their relationship unfortunately the delta print of this isn t worth the savings since it was taken from a spotty scratchy older print with odd visual and sound jumps it s disconcerting to say the least better check out the double bill of charade and its remake truth about charlie since that print has been lovingly restored this tightly plotted fast moving thriller deserves to be as well loved as it is and cinephiles should be ashamed of themselves if they haven t yet seen it a must have 
holo mai pele this spectacular and powerful singing and dance performance and the excellent commentaries telling the story of the fire goddess pele and her sister hiiaka gives deep insights into hawaiian culture and religious belief and is wonderful to watch for me it helps keep alive memories of my own visit to hawaii and the volcanoes national park should be of interest to anyone who loves traditional dance and or mythology

wonderful crawford and huston the first time i saw the film was when i saw it in the sale in virgin mega stores so i picked it up and put it on straight away a soon as i got home and i was totally amazed with crawfords wonderful performance and also was amazed with hustons performance too in rain crawford plays a prostertute called sadie tompson who has ran away form her old life in san francisco but as soon as she arrives at this hotel at pongo pongo she already gets into trouble as soon as she enters the hotel by this preachers wife but later she has a run in with the preacher huston which isn t good for her huston hypnotises her with prayers and it makes her want to go to san francisco but huston in the ends slashes his throat and sadie turns back to normal its one of the best films crawford has ever made 
awesome i got my product alot faster than i expected and in excellent condition i have no complaints 
well its mood elavation for me everything the esteemed reviewer above said is so very true and more i didn t see it as what a metaphor for nyc or something but then i never viewed any movie as being an intellectual experience as he i ll just say that sometime during the mid seventies i was somewhere in upstate ny and i was the assistant theater manager for the local cinema which meant that i sold the tix and i threw out the noisemakers and um ex was the manager which meant she projected the movies ok that said she and i both went hysterical over p and we even once sneakily invited a few choice friends new york city choice friends to a private party sort of showing and everybody well you would ve thought we were projecting horse feathers or duck soup or something ! walter matthau is hilarious as the belabored transit director and you ready for this jerry stiller as the chief of police plot you ask robert shaw martin balsam and a couple of other guys kidnap an nyc subway transit train and hold it ransom for a million bucks right now however one would probably hear every conceivable ethnic stereotype bellowing racist because of p s unforgivingtoanyones characterizations back then though we didn t get our feelings hurt so easily and we could laugh at ourselves and we did enjoy taking of pelham one two three and don t try to be siskel ropert or rex reed or anything just enjoy yourself and i won t give it away but the movie does have a happy ending hilarious really 
a must see for people in love this is pure moonshine this is a piece of art the freshness of the colbert and gable is a treasure to behold the dialogue is smart and witty and even the s slang oh yeah and its like is used to great advantage in the film this is one of the rare cases when everything in a film works enough said

one of the most impressive films ever made faust is just an incredible accomplishment in the art of silent cinema one of the most ambitious and masterfully directed films of any era if you ve never seen a silent film and wonder if one could even keep your attention faust is the film to watch far too many classic early films were either lost or came to us in relatively poor condition but this digitally mastered version of faust is remarkably clear and free of white outs i m sure it looks better now that it did when it was released over eight decades ago don t go thinking we re only talking about characters standing around conversing either f w murnau packed all kinds of incredible special effects into this magnificent piece of filmmaking you all know faust that fellow who made a deal with the devil the story goes back as far as the fifteenth century with johann wolfgang von goethe penning the definitive version in the early nineteenth century murnau s faust differs somewhat from the original two part drama written by goethe supplanting rationalism with mysticism no one did mysticism better than early german filmmakers this approach among other things allows murnau to open the film with nothing less than jaw dropping visuals and effects the story is heralded by the grim image of the apocalyptic horsemen thundering through the clouds leading us to a confrontation between mephisto satan and an archangel over the control of the earth a wager is proposed with dominion over the earth set to depend upon the fate of one man s soul that man is of course faust a good man targeted for evil temptation by the cursed one knowing he could not tempt faust directly mephisto uses his own compassion against him as a devastating plague is unleashed among faust s fellow citizens mephisto casts his dark shadow over the landscape quite literally as we see him hovering over the entire village that to me is one of the most memorable and iconographic cinematic sights i ve ever seen as his friends and neighbors beg faust gosta ekman to save them from the plague his unanswered prayers bring him to the point of despair he actually summons mephisto himself in another incredible special effects laden scene after some deliberation mephisto emil jannings convinces faust to sign a pact for one day only and that proves to be an offer faust can t refuse a little later though mephisto brings in the big guns the promise of restored youth extending the contract from one day to eternity is basically just a formality at this point all of his new powers don t truly satisfy faust though and so he sets his sights on a lovely pure maiden by the name of gretchen camilla horn the whole mood of the film changes at this point with the art of wooing temporarily displacing the clouds of doom hanging over the first half of the film but this is only a prelude to true tragedy as daniel johnston says dont play cards with satan he ll deal you an awful hand and that is exactly what happens here it gets pretty darned depressing really making it hard for the viewer to see how faust can possibly redeem himself for all of the misery he has caused murnau doesn t pull any punches when it comes to establishing the central theme of the story thanks to earlier successes such as nosferatu and the last laugh murnau had complete control over the making of faust something of a perfectionist murnau made sure that every aspect of every single shot met with his satisfaction it s obvious that the man was a genius as even the contrast of light and shadow reinforces the central motif of the story he is telling the special effects seem years and years ahead of their time even the makeup is remarkably well done i would never have guessed that gosta ekman played both the old and young versions of faust as the older version looks genuinely old and the acting top notch all the way ekman is superb emil jannings becomes the very personification of mephisto and an inexperienced camilla horn is simply enchanting as gretchen the role of gretchen was actually written for lillian gish but she bowed out because murnau refused her demand to have her own personal cameraman shoot the film the musical score composed and conducted by timothy brock is a wonderful counterpart to the film as well in virtually every way possible f w murnau s faust is nothing less than a cinematic masterpiece

truly memorable screen adaptation of shakespeare s first and bloodiest tragedy made by a very talented director titus is a stylish visually stunning energetic and truly memorable adaptation of the bloodiest parade of horrors which the first tragedy of the young shakespeare is more of the horror show than powerful and poetic later bard s tragedies titus andronicus offers betrayal murders tortures rape and cannibalism for which julie taymor s vision was just perfect in transferring this blood fest to the screen if it is not enough the movie has one of the greatest performances in shakespeare s tragedies i ve seen and it is harry j lennix as aaron never have i seen an actor who was able to combine both noble othello and the embodiment of evil iago in one character so convincingly with such power anthony hopkins jessica lange alan cumming and colin feore all give terrific performances 
if you were a fan then get ready to be a fan again finally wrestlemania has come to dvd while the wwe has really screwed up the current product the dvd releases are simply amazing ever since the hulk hogan disc dvd they have been batting at least in my opinion i just got the first volumes along with the jake roberts dvd needless to say i am in s wrestling heaven the wrestlemania anthology volume is an incredible step in getting many of the older ppv s out on dvd to put it simply this is amazing while i initially skipped over wm i i went straight to to watch steamboat vs savage piper vs adonis then put in wm iv to watch strike force vs demolition and the wwf title finals with savage vs dibiase so i didn t get through the entire set and i didn t watch every second of each event but for a fan like me to see these matches in dvd quality well i don t think it gets any better like everyone else i totally enjoy the fact that the jessie ventura commentary is there during the steamboat savage match to hear him say where is that refferee makes me laugh every time i can say the music changes that i noticed are minimal at best and i could really care less as it s all about the matches that gives wrestlemania it s reputation the quality is great the menus are designed very basic allowing you to pretty much pull up any match segment or interview from the evening i only purchased the first volumes because i have the rest on dvd already and i have no desire to own some of these titles twice great set for any fan that was there since the beginning or still watches today because of how good it used to be fair weather fans that only recently started watching because of cena will find the matches boring but if you watch wrestling because of john cena you have other situations you need to take care of the next set i would like to see would be summerslam ! 
one of the best movies i loved this movie it was awsome i compare to it to the lost boys and fright night i like the way this one is made because they are not refered to as vampires and they never show fangs i highly recomend this to anyone who is a fan of the lost boys or fright night

wow ! don t read about the movie just go watch it often in my reviews i touch on elements of the plot i wouldn t call them spoilers per se but i went in to this movie almost cold and that turned out to be an immensely rewarding experience ! harakiri rewards patience i was actually bored for the first minutes of the film and then it all comes together somewhat light on action this film is an articulate criticism of the corruption power brings and the length one man goes to expose the hypocrisy

a lot of fun to watch i don t own this one as a dvd but i caught it on digital cable on demand and i will say william castle is a damn good director i would loved to see this one in the theater the young kid in the film was great and so was the older sister if i saw this movie if i was younger i think i would be doing much more with writing ghost stories than i do right now coming from an author who writes ghost stories either as a fictional medium or a true medium one can really appreciate the master of gimmicks i saw the remake of this movie too when i was staying at my now apartment during a party trying to fall asleep waiting for medicine to kick in at the time since i had a bad case of bronchitis and the flu at the party in though william castle s been dead for years now it is amazing what the guy was able to do with the genre 
the tragic abyss between the utopist dreams and the real world the first accords of i put a spell on you by credence clearwater revival works out as smart introduction for this peculiar chamber work an irreverent exponent of the beatnik generation who was born in scotland and came to usa in the early seventies searching for a dream he lives in the east coast trying to reproduce his birthplace according smart ellipsis we realize he belonged to the hippie generation intending to harmonize the environmental equilibrium and preserving the best he can to isolate from the madding crowd he does not have tv and he refuses to establish further relations with the outer world on the other hand his emotional life has bee a total failure his wife left them a long time ago so under this sorrowful perspectives he lives with her daughter intending to mold her according his idiosyncratic life s style he dislikes the homogeneity of the urban architecture and specially in that island and is a well convinced the world goes to the final disintegration due is in absolute decadence he has a mistress who lives out of town so when he begs his lover to live with them this woman who has two teenagers agrees but very soon the unthinkable consequences of this terrible decision will reach a boiling point of unpredictable situations rebecca miller s pulsating and minimalist direction reminded me to lars von triers in breaking the waves additionally the presence of this extraordinary actor daniel day lewis as well as a well supporting cast have conformed one of the most intense mature and haunting films of this decade a poignant film that demands all your attention 
a beautiful look back at a fateful decade this was originally a chapter in the excellent project twenty series on television years ago it is a magnificent look at a decade that included the depression the roosevelt years the labor strife and the gathering storm clouds in europe beautifully narrated by the the most mellifluous voice of alexander scourby the last five minutes while scourby narrates the end of an era over images of the new york world s fair and the music of the september song is overwhelming especially for anyone over there isn t any television like this nowadays a treasure 
i worship cabin boy this is one of the best movies ! if you want a good laugh its priceless i ve been hunting for it but its out of print so i amazoned it and buying it made my day the characters are a riot and the plot is hilarious you cant get enough of the cabin boy dancing to cat on a hot tin roof while having cans thrown at him by pirates 
great comedy this is an off the wall comedy with john candy and eugen levy i had to get this one lots of laugh 
king arthur like you ve never seen him before this film has it all with spectacular scenery an interesting story line and good acting this is definitely not the king arthur that most of us have seen in past films or read about in the wonderful stories of mary stewart this arthur is no gentle scholar but a skilled roman soldier the story begins with an explanation about how rome required the young men from their conquered countries to spend fifteen years in service as a soldier in the roman army after that time they were free to go where they pleased in this film arthur is presented as a great knight and the leader of a band of very skilled soldiers his men including galahad and lancelot are all seasoned warriors and have fulfilled their duty to rome just before they leave the army they are advised that the saxons are invading roman territory and they are needed they are all battle weary but forced to take up their weapons and go on one last mission guinever is of course beautiful and in this story a capable warrior one part was pure hollywood where during a battle scene king arthur and his knights are completely covered in armor and guinever goes into battle with them wearing body paint and skimpy clothes aside from that bit of silliness this is an interesting and well done film clive owen makes a great arthur ! 
but not for beginers i know a bit of martial arts and have been doing yoga for awhile so this workout was perfect for me not too long not too short i was quite the sweaty mess when it was done but if you re a real beginer with no yoga or karate training this probably isn t for you namaste 
twice the bill twice the kill i sometimes joke that to me kill bill volume is the second greatest movie of all time and that kill bill volume is the greatest movie ever on a serious note both volumes are excellent releases and do not disappoint especially for tarantino fans who were hoping for intense elements of pulp fiction kill bill volume picks up with black mamba s rampage for redemption and revenge for the murder of her fiance and those closest to him from start to finish is action in sync with brilliant dialogue that is mixed in with occasional flashes of humor beatrix kiddo aka black mamba as played by uma thurman is a woman on a mission a kind of mission where no one in this sequel can truly assist her besides her weapons there is no support or assistance that she will be receiving in order to possess the physical and psychological edges that will be needed in order to overcome what were her nemeses some very scary situations and predicaments are myriad throughout but much inspiration can be drawn from witnessing the outcomes resulting from beatrix kiddo s firm resolve to not be overcome by fear and panic in the worst of situations perilous or not great music accompanies the fighting sequences that kiddo must endure and the haphazardous journey travels that have to be undertaken charlie feathers can t hardly stand it and three ennio morricone classics from movies past namely il tramonto l arena and a silhouette of doom are aptly mixed in along with other great musical arrangements and reproductions that unanimously make both kill bill volumes not only among the greatest in motion pictures but also in movie soundtracks again great action great dialogue and great music combine along with a great cast that only quentin tarantino could amalgamate for this awesome winning formula 
best movie ever made major payne is the greatest comedy movie ever made for all age 
well worth the money i bought this set a couple of weeks ago and just finished getting through it it is well worth the money you won t be sorry you bought it funny as it gets 
absolutley pertinent banned from american and british broadcast this documentary is an essential look at the other side whether you support the us war in iraq the informed citizen would benefit from a look at the control room 
speedy great condition i received my item within a week of ordering it was still wrapped in the protective cellophane and it was in great condition with everything intact and accounted for 
a troubled but worthwhile new start the ninth season of stargate sg has some major casting changes and the show handles it about as well as it can be done considering all that has come to pass last season ended some major plot lines and new ones are needed the principle new adversaries are the orai an offshoot of the ancients who seek to force their worship upon everyone this does not mean that the goa uld are completely beaten they too have some surprises in store for the sg team the team has a new commander and he gets off to a rocky start both within the show and in his part but he soon seems to fit in he is not as humerous as o neill but he is a worthy leader the newly freed jaffa are in tumult over their own leadership louis gossett jr does a good job of playing a leader in opposition to teal cits a new world but it still has more than its share of problems episode synopses follow avalon parts and sg has a new commander ltc cameron mitchell but he has a problem all of the old sg team has transferred elsewhere and he has to put a new team together from scratch he is not having much luck help comes from an unexpected source a former goa uld host turned con artist shows up in her scheming vala gets daniel jackson to try on a bracelet he does and finds himself locked to her they cannot be separated for more than a short while without them both falling ill she did not expect this she was conned by the person she stole the bracelets from this gives the new colonel an excuse to get the old gang together to try and fix the problem in an attempt to shed light on the mystery they begin to work on arthurian mythology and find an outpost of the ancients in england it was the avalon of king arthur they find the place but it is protected by a series of riddles solving the riddles reveals that this outpost was built by a group of the ancients who did not ascend jackson and the con artist are still bound by the bracelets but they have a clue that might help them get free of them to do so they will have to use an alien communications device and try to contact the ancients origin jackson and vala make it to another galaxy using the communication device but they find that only their minds have been transferred their bodies are still back on earth while their minds are borrowing the bodies of a couple of locals they find a medieval culture subject to a religious tyranny run by men called priors the priors in turn serve the orai the orai want worship and they are pleased to learn of a new galaxy in which they can send their priors they also want to suppress any knowledge which will conflict with that aim it seems that the orai are an offshoot of the ancients who took a very different path than non involvementthe tie that binds jackson and vala are still tied together by the bracelets and are getting desperate for a way to get them off she finally agrees to seek guidance from the guy she stole the bracelets from he agrees to help but only if she returns a piece of jewelry she stole from him she has already unloaded it but agrees to try this is difficult because the person she sold it to refuses to return it unless she first returns a power coil she traded it for when the owner of the coil is tracked down he refuses to return it until she gets back the trading ship she took from him this involves stealing it back from the thieves she left it with lots of danger and a few buffoons eventually the tangled web is untangled this is not one of the better episodes the powers that be the orai are sending out priors to proselytize out galaxy when the sg team learns of one attempt they head off to try and prevent it they expect to be aided by vala who has a history with that particular planet what she fails to tell them is that her connection is that she was the host for the goa uld who was there god she played this up after the death of the parasite so that she could continue as a god when she returns she chides the locals for turning their backs on her things go poorly though when they overhear her talking about being a false god that puts the locals squarely in the camp of the orai s priors as a battle for hearts and minds ensues beachhead a prior establishes a beachhead on a jaffa planet and the locals want nothing to do with more false gods this hacks the prior off and he establishes a force field around the entire planet fending off all the jaffa who attack him meanwhile stargate command gets a message from a renegade goa uld who offers to help in the fight of the orai samantha carter shows up to help out in the fight they take the prometheus and a naquadria enhanced nuke to blow up the gate things get more complicated when a free jaffa fleet shows up to try and destroy the gate when the superbomb goes off it makes the expansion of the beachhead even faster this does not make anyone happy except the renegade who turns out to have hidden motives help in staving off the big invasion comes from an unexpected source ex deus machina when a jaffa is found dead on earth it raises some questions as to why he is there his death correlates with the disappearance of several industrialists gerak the leader of the free jaffa claims to know nothing about it the emphasis is on claims gerak is trying to stir the jaffa council into working against the tok ra he is also trying to sow mistrust for te alc who he sees as competition the plot thickens when it becomes apparent that ba al is alive and on earth he wants to go into retirement and be left alone to pursue his own aims he claims to have a naquada bomb in the us he will set off if he is bothered everyone wants to capture ba al for political reasons ba al is captured and executed but that doesn t help since there seems to be more of him around babylon while visiting a new planet the team comes under fire from some hostile jaffa and ltc mitchell is captured by them the rest of the team manages to capture one of the jaffa this group has according to legend not been subject to the goa uld for thousands of years jackson finds signs of ancient technology but no sign of the jaffa or the missing colonel the jaffa holding the colonel have some technology from the ancients but are disdainful of everyone particularly the jaffa who did not follow them into exile when a prior of the orai shows up the colonel learns that he has made some inroads he realizes that this group of jaffa allied with the orai will be a major threat prototype as last season concluded it seemed as if all of the threats from the goa uld had pretty much been taken care of then earlier this season we learned that ba al is still around and actually on earth biding his time in retirement this episode we learn that anubis still poses a problem as well as the team is investigating a problem with a stargate they find a person in suspended animation he is brought back to sgc and he claims to have been enslaved everyone believes him until jackson finds some notes in the lab where the stasis field was found they have found anubis private lab and the person they revived is a clone complete with goa uld dna he is just a few steps short of being able to ascend himself sgc sees the threat as too dangerous and they want to solve the problem right then and there a politician however has other ideas he sees it as a great opportunity to recoup some of the enormous investment put into the program and is sure they can control him they are wrong anubis is just playing along letting sgc do the work and preparing to strike when he does nobody can stop him he does not however count on a dirty trick by ltc carter the fourth horseman the orai are still sending out priors and they are setting their sights high a prior is sent to gerak the powerful leader of the jaffa sect in power strangely enough gerak seems to fall for it at first the acceptance is subtle but the priors demand more and more until it is revealed that they demand the absolute obedience of all jaffa by this time gerak is in too deep to see the danger earth has its problems as well people start dropping from the same plague induced by the priors a few episodes back the plague spreads quickly the one ray of sunshine is the return of the ascended ancient orlan who fell in love with sam a few seasons back he has returned to help but has had to take human form he took the form of a child because that would allow him to retain more of his knowledge although that does put a crimp in his romantic aspirations he is helpful but then he too falls sick before he does so he reveals some critical information about the orai and their priors as everyone suspected they are lying and there is a reason the worship of mortals is sought sickest of all though is gerak he is ordered to destroy chulak the home world of te alc in order to set an example for all jaffa even he balks at this until the orai make an offer that he can t refuse the fourth horseman part gerak is now a prior with all of the power that entails he is determined to force the force the conversion of all jaffa earth is still in the midst of the prior s plague it has become international and the world is going to soon die there is a hope the lab has come up with an experimental gizmo that is supposed to nullify the priors powers they intend to use it to return to soudan the planet of the babylon episode to tray and capture the prior working there they want some of his dna to try and fight the plague the people of soudan are not fond of the sg team but when they arrive it seems that the jaffa there are becoming disillusioned and are ready to fight they just don t know how sg is there to help sg plans even more they want to try and turn the prior against the orai they manage to capture the prior but the cure doesn t work neither does their plan to turn him they do get help from a surprising source however the source manages to effect a cure for almost everyone but there is still the specter of how to deal with the orai themselves there is also the problem of orlan he gave his all and now he is helpless collateral damage sgc makes contact with a civilization which has made a major breakthrough in working with goa uld technology they have perfected a device to let people share memories that will mean that a pilot or engineer could transfer his experience in hours instead of years these people want to trade and sgc is eager unfortunately there are plots inside of plots the scientist who developed the process objects to having it militarized that means she is a liability to the local power structure and she is killed ltc mitchell is framed for the murder the hope is that he will claim diplomatic immunity and whole thing can be swept under the rug but mitchell is not about to take the easy way out he has actual memories of killing the woman and demands an investigation in doing so he faces a possible death sentence ripple effect things are a bit peculiar when the sg team returns to sgc a bit early the general is puzzled when they reference people who are dead or events that transpired differently from the way he remembers a little bit into the debriefing words comes that the gate has been activated and it occurs right on schedule for when sg should have returned the returning party turns out to be sg things get a bit more confusing when other sg teams begin to arrive some of them contain dead members or people who have dropped out of the series they figure out that a wormhole problem has caused alternate realities to funnel their returning teams to our earth each of the alternate worlds is a bit different and each faces dire threats some of these threats have been faced on our world before and others are fresh in an effort to avoid becoming the grand central station of the multiverse the general orders a halt to further traffic now they have to figure out how to fix the problem a possible solution is found but that solution has the downside that it strands all of those who were misdirected here to our world permanently even so sgc proceeds with the plan and the alternates mutiny they have a plan of their own and this gives the real sam an idea to restore things to the way they are supposed to be stronghold the jaffa council is considering a proposal to dissolve itself and hold widespread elections teal c and his faction support it and they expect the only female member of the council to support it as well when she gets up to speak however she speaks against it when a member is asked to speak with her she zaps him with something and he changes his mind when teal c sets off to investigate he gets captured by ba al who seems to be having a rather active retirement it seems that ba al is worried about the orai and is trying to press the jaffa into his service the jaffa are worried about the orai as well but some things are just beyond the pale ethon a few seasons back the sg team encountered a world in a terrible state of cold war the presence of the team sent the locals over the brink and the war heated up with devastating consequences now the orai have taken an interest offering a superweapon to one side in exchange for worship sgc finds itself in the position of having to interfere again but not before daniel is taken hostage by the party with the superweapon the weapon by the way is very capable of defending itself with catastrophic results now the survivors of the attack are now faced with the problem of taking out the superweapon with the technology available to the war torn world the solution further tears apart the world off the grid sgc gets reports of food riots and learns that the riots are not over hunger but over shortages of the addictive corn fearing some sort of orai plot sg is sent to investigate things go badly and as the team is trying to make its getaway the stargate disappears the local drug lords think that sg is responsible and that means trouble for the team the bigger trouble is that ba al is the one getting frisky nerus and his appetites give sgc some information that is of course bogus but by their manipulation he leads them to ba al what neither ba al nor sgc seems to understand is the wrath of thwarted drug lords scourge the sg team is given the awful duty of babysitting some international politicians and bureaucrats on their first trip off world they go to the gamma site where research is conducted on things too strange or dangerous to bring back to earth one of the scientists is studying a bug that has shown up only on planets where the priors have shown up the bug is a voracious crop destroyer but there is no proof that they are connected to the priors all this change when some hungry bugs in the lab get a taste of meatloaf then they undergo a metamorphosis and become voracious carnivores and overrun the place the bugs don t seem to be too choosy they will eat bureaucrats as well as stargate team members and scientists sg evacuates the lab with the simpletons i mean politicos in tow they have to hold on until a ship can come to pick them up the one defense the team has is that the bugs are very sensitive to sound that means that the guns keep them away until they run out of ammo arthurs mantle sam is in the lab playing with a piece of offworld tech that has been puzzling her for a while she finally gets a response from it and it zaps her and ltc mitchell with some sort of ray they seem none the worse for wear until they notice that nobody else can see or hear them they also cannot grip or handle anything they are out of phase and stuck in an alternate dimension while they are trying to figure out how to communicate with someone a garbled messages comes through the stargate from the world of the soudan jaffar they are under attack sg minus mitchell and carter head out to investigate and find that almost all of them have been killed they were attacked by the jaffa captured by sg the fourth horseman episode he has been infected by a prior and can absorb a lot of damage meanwhile jackson figures out that the device carter was working on was the legendary mantle of arthur it was used by merlin to hide some of his experiments he was working on a weapon to use against the orai ltc mitchell heads out to soudan to try and help teal c he is still hidden but is convinced that he will be able to do something when teal c tries the cloaking device of the ancients he is able to see and hear mitchell though physical touch is not possible that makes mitchell able to really help although sgc finds a solution to his problem at a most inopportune time crusade a few episodes back vala was lost as she helped to destroy a gigantic stargate intended by the orai to be a beachhead into our galaxy now she

brilliant acting by roth and ormond i stumbled upon this video very late one night about two weeks ago quite by accident i was drawn in immediately and held absolutely spellbound by the performances of both tim roth and julia ormond since then i have purchased the video and rewatched it more times than i can count each time loving the movie more this is a love story against all odds a tender heart wrenching passionate love story of two people drawn together by lonliness need and desire i agree with one reviewer who said this was one of the most erotically charged films ever seen i have never seen roth portray this kind of character and i must say i have become an avid fan and only hope he will take on more roles of this nature his performance was riveting i e tender sensitive poignant and very human i certainly don t mean to downplay ormond s performance it was superb as well the chemistry between the actors was incredibly real both of whom conveyed so much feeling through their eyes facial expressions and body language since discovering this gem i have read a lot of the reviews and i totally disagree with one movie critic who said roth was miscast in the part the fact that he does not look like brad pitt makes it even more believeable for me roth may not be handsome in the classic sense but he has a unique look very sexy intense charismatic and sensual this movie touches me deeply i only wish that the ending had not been so rushed i would love to see this movie make it to dvd 
short effective lower body routine as lisa kay says we have minutes to shape your legs this video definitely accomplishes that lisa is joined by fellow firm master instructors including libby who demonstrates beginner modifications you will need a fanny lifter or stool step and assorted dumbells the majority of the workout is strength work there are sets of leg presses some of which incorporate some calf raises squats lunges dips plie squats curtsy dips plus some cardio segments to give the legs a brief break from the weight work while keeping the heartrate up this video was quite challenging for me lisa does a good job instructing here for those looking for short lower body workouts this is a good choice you will work the legs from every angle and then some it should be noted that it is all standing leg work there is no floor work here there is another firm video available called lower body sculpt ii which is all floor work overall a good lower body strengthening routine

delightful romantic comedy trick is one of the better gay romantic comedies that s come out in the past few years christian campbell and j p pitok are both good as the shy aspiring composer and the hunky go go boy i got this movie because i saw a clip on the web of pitok dancing and thought i d watch the whole movie and am very glad i did clinton leung is a riot as a vengeful drag queen and tori spelling almost steals every scene she s in as a wonderfully bad singer actress who is selfish and overbearing and doesn t really realize it i don t remember his name but the guy who plays campbell s writing teacher is hilarious when he sings te me gusta mi pinga at a piano bar then has a heartfelt reunion with his ex lover thwarting the new lover s tryst at his apartment the two guys have a very hard time finding a place to get together during the night and the whole adventure ends with a lovely moment on a street corner in the morning light with a touching goodbye and a promise that they ll get together in the future i m still waiting for the second date with the two campbell is an accomplished stage actor and pretty good singer as evidenced by his star turn in reefer madness and pitok showed his range as a sleazy boyfriend of claire s on six feet under a season or two ago all in all this is a delightful movie with a few slow spots here and there but they re easily overlooked 
a day without a wicket is like a day without sunshine how to succeed is an energetic and snappy satire of big business as the story opens j pierpont finch robert morse is a poor but ambitious window washer he finds a howto book that can teach him to climb the corporate ladder in no time at all ponty follows the book s advice and advances from the mailroom of the world wide wicket company to become its president falling in love with secretary rosemary michele lee along the way the movie looks like a staged play and that s a good thing since this was such a smash hit on broadway it preserves forever the look of the early sixties with vibrant colors pillbox hats and references to metrecal and wildroot cream oil the unique robert morse is the whole show here he originated the stage role of ponty and this movie made him an even bigger star he is a great singer and dancer but it s his irresistible personality and charisma that keep you rooting for him michele lee is perfect as his leading lady and rudy vallee reprises his stage role as the singing dancing and knitting big boss this is a happy fun movie kon

the quintessential jazz concert dvd the concert starts out with jack de johnette coming out on stage and beginning the concert with a drum solo jack de johnette is quite the legend in terms of jazz drumming and he has been a top name in that area for at least the past twenty years along with billy cobham and dave weckyl jack de johnette is one of the top jazz drummers of today he can really groove ! his solo that begins the concert is flamboyant yet reserved patterned within what appears to be chaos and it swings quite well after about three minutes of playing he is joined by dave holland on the upright or acoustic bass i don t know much about dave holland but have heard the name before he performs superb walking bass lines on the upright bass and he and the drummer really form the backbone of the rhythm section here and they swing quite well together then herbie hancock comes out on stage and gets down to business on his grand piano herbie hancock has always been a favorite of mine from the early days of his pioneer fusion band in the s the head hunters to his days of fame with the rockit band in the s herbie hancock has shown a wide range in his varied career here in this concert he returns to his traditional jazz roots and plays really excellently then it s metheny s turn pat comes out on stage and picks up his electric guitar and begins to play as the three back him up metheny plays with flamboyance and full of jazz authority and sophistication here the whole quartet now sounds excellent and they shift from sheer improvisation to a written tune and metheny changes guitars and also the sound of the guitar changes pat likes to play this one electric guitar i think it is called the synclavier guitar and it sounds like an off tune trumpet to some a guitar should sound like a guitar but metheny seems to like this guitar sound as he uses it quite a lot i actually like it too and pat whales away in up and down jazz riffs that seem to come out of nowhere sound fantastic and live up to the complete jazz improvisation that he does best the whole concert on dvd is about one hour and forty minutes and the dvd will cost you about it may seem a little pricey for a concert dvd but the whole production is great the sound quality is superb the camera angles and aspects during the concert are superb when one of the artists does a solo you can see and hear him clearly also the concert was recorded in a full fifteen years ago each of these respective musicians is arguably at the height of their abilities here and it really shows there are about six tunes that the quartet plays at least one tune being composed by that respective artist one cool thing about jazz is that none of these musicians are in the same regular band but you d never know that by this concert they play so well together and are so tight in their performance it s great they have that wonderful ability that all great musicians have and jazz musicians in particular that is great communication pat can look at herbie and they seem to read each other s minds some people don t understand jazz and think it is just chaos if they only had a chance to see and hear this concert it all makes sense so all in all i highly recommend this concert dvd to any lover of jazz music and in particular to the fans of the respective artists metheny de johnette holland and hancock a delight 
yes it s safe so safe you wouldn t believe released in based on william goldman s bestseller of the same name marathon man was a greatly anticipated film and it worked brillantly on screen goldman seemed to take two elements that spook people nazi s and dentists so fused them into one character dr szell dr szell played to the hilt by laurence oliver who was ill at the time and was considered uninsurable has come out of hiding in uraguay to collect his war booty and crosses paths with dustin hoffman a graduate student who s drawn into the situation by his brother who works for a shadow element of the government it s a complicated story as you would hope for in a thriller a world class cast of actors skillfully directed by john schlesinger makes for a great film one that can be viewed repeatedly i saw it when it opened at the loews in times square in and i still can watch it but must confess i still close my eyes when dr szell is torturing the marathon man ouchh ! goldman was so right a nazi dentist nothing could be more fiendish

stars for a great film i m surprised the caddy didn t win an oscar for this film a classic character study which can never happen again a remake would have alma patricia neal s character as the one in control and hud as a conflicted guy battling his feminine side actually neal s character is the strongest in this black and white masterpiece her ahead ofhertime nonflamboyant sensuousness underscores her strength here she flirts she beats guys at cards she even admits to hud that she s not invulnerable to his masculinity that last one wouldn t be in any imagined remake point is neal s oscar winning performance should be appreciated at the same level as newman s work and for my money he over acts just a tad paul battles with oscarwinning melvyn douglas over the future of the ranch dealing with cattle cannot sustain especially at the prospect of drilling for oil the elder bannon shows his own stubbornness when he loses his grip when his cattle have to be removed due to disease not an easy film to embrace not one to watch once a week with a microwave dinner but worth collecting 
fun filled and light hearted bend it like beckham was a very enjoyable movie to watch it was inspirational and heart warming for young girls with a dream in showing that you can be anything that you want if you work hard enough jonathan rhys meyers was great in the role of the coach parminder nagra showed a wide range in her acting abilities considering this is one of her first films keira knightley sparkled in her role as a tomboy with a homophobic mother bringing just the right amount of humor to the film it was an all around sweet yet touching film examining the influence of culture in a young girl s life the film poked fun at the proper life of a young indian girl growing up in a traditional household without getting too serious the costumes were rich in color and the soccer scenes were well filmed without looking fake all around bend it like beckham was an enjoyable and sweet romantic comedy it s definitely worth the watch

a better influence for science fiction than star trek okay you have three key officers a captain a doctor and a science officer oh and the chief engineer is a scotsman ! does any of this sound familiar for the s the original star trek series is hailed for breaking feminist ground by allowing wimminfolk to answer phone calls on the bridge and change bedpans down in sickbay on fireball xl dr venus is a brilliant space doctor who often makes key contributions to the success of the missions she participates as a fellow adventurer and not simply as a damsel in distress she even flies a supersonic jet and saves a space general s life yes dr venus gets coffee for steve zodiac but he s busy flying the spaceship and can t leave his station and her act is not submissiveness but simple kindness and courtesy remember when men and women liked to please each other it seems to me that she is far and away one of the best feminist role models to emerge from s tv sf meanwhile a few years later on the nonsexist star trek captain kirk commands a spaceship where the females all wear miniskirts the yeoman falls into his lap every time the romulans attack and he saves the universe again and again by bedding alien females steve zodiac may have joked just like a woman but he always showed venus genuine respect while captain kirk may have limited his remarks to a smirk but blatantly treated women merely as objects if not playthings yes fireball xl is nothing more than a children s show it is also nothing less than a ground breaking television series in the science fiction genre it certainly paved the way for the portrayal of more realistic human interest stories in science fiction and that contribution shouldn t be overlooked just because you can see the strings 
bring on the odaiko one earth tour vs live at the acropolis this cd dvd concert far surpasses live at the acropolis in presenting kodo in their element live performance first of all it is a complete concert presented start to finish it isn t cut up at crucial moments by interview snippets it also conveys the intensity of kodo a decade after acropolis one earth tour shows a more seasoned serious and focused kodo gone is the smiling pageantry of kodo the folk ensemble kodo is no longer here to win you over to japanese percussive traditions enter the dumbfounding even intimidating virtuosity and physicality of an older wiser frighteningly intense kodo channeling hundreds of years of tradition into a thunderous pulse that leaves the viewer listener speechless 
one of the best movies about vietnam based on a true story location vietnam in the valley of the death lt colonel moore leading american troopers is surrounded by north vietnamese soldiers amazing combat scenes costumes and weapons with perfect graphic authenticity making this movie stands apart from all the vietnam movies ever filmed before the casting the dialogue and colors are amazing as well not to forget the perfect acting of mel gibson and sam elliott i have seen all the war movies about vietnam in my opinion we were soldiers is one of the best that came so far from all the aspect described above including the historical side this movie is a must own to all collectors of this genre 
diamonds are forever i ordered this package because of captain hornblower and the three musketeers two films that have really marked my childhood memories i haven t had the chance to see the rest of the films so this package was an excellent chance to do so and also get the two other films that i only possess in worn out vhs copies i have already watched captain hornblower and it was as if it was brand new the quality and sound are of high quality the colours are better and i also loved the fact that i had the english subtitles available i always wanted to figure out the fire as your guns bare phrase the price is not a bargain only if you compare it with other available box sets but i would pay even more for this one 
classic bond this might not be the greatest bond movie of all time though i d say it s in the top three but it most assuredly has the most breath taking women they ve never found anyone hotter than claudine auger in all the rest of the bond movies and as far as villians go luciana paluzzi wow if your going to be killed i guess sleeping with her before wouldn t be the worst way to go as for the movie great story great action classic bond 
amazing ! must see this is one of the best films i have seen in the past five years bill sage is fantastic ! he has done so much great work but this it the best performance i have seen him give yet this film was directed by hal hartley who gave us incredible films like trust surviving desire and simple men for someone not familiar with the hal hartley style of film where the actors speak in a stilted manner like in a samuel beckett play this film may seem strange but once you get used to this style you can learn to appreciate it and see that it actually adds depth to the performances i have always loved hal hartley films but this one is my favorite this film explores many important present day issues and concepts in a science fiction format it was incredibly moving to see important issues like terrorism security and authority dealt with in an intelligent honest non propagandistic way i can not recommend this film enough every american should see this film you can check out more of hal hartely s and bill sage s films at possiblefilms com 
the wonderboy music video alone is worth getting this dvd i don t remember how many years ago it was but very late one night i was watching mtv or mtv and the tenacious d music video wonderboy came on i had no idea who they were but i thought the video was fantastic visually vocally i never saw or heard about the song or video again back then my attempts to search the internet for the music video came up w the michael douglas movie of the similar name wonderboys i remember watching the video that fateful night thinking hey i ve seen that guy before on that hbo program mr show jack black was a triple threat even back then his performance on mr show was full of energy and his lead role on their take of jesus christ superstar was over the top it may have taken a few years but it s good to see the music video and even the making of it is now available the fact that wonderboy is a spike jonze video makes sense i ve enjoyed spike s other videos movies i can t wait to revisit the video and check out the rest of tenacious d at last to me this is a win win dvd jack black spike and wonderboys music video all in one ! 
heart warming this film warms my heart makes me laugh provides some good points for teaching and sermon illustrations i am surrounded by people who have forgotten who they are tinkerbell s push to help peter remember has deeper meaning than perhaps it s meant to have but it s true nonetheless

a beautiful piece of cinematographic work from hell is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography i ve ever seen in a horror movie although the story about who jack the ripper is is a little contrived at times in general the plot is interesting all the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you d expect considering the subject matter it keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours not to mention it looks beautiful heather graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the victorian era and johnny depp is amazing as usual although as others have pointed out his english accent may be a little off which i wouldn t know about since i m american this film is great entertainment and i would highly recommend buying the dvd if you rent it you ll more than likely end up buying it anyway it s that good from hell makes a great addition to any movie collection 
truly wonderful one of the finest movies i have ever seen ! it must have beenso hard to make ! dudley moore makes it ! 
a rare suspense film of subtlety and depth the deep end is one of my top ten favourite films of this moody suspenseful and very intelligent suspense drama about a mother who finds herself in a terrifying situation with a couple of blackmailers is told with great subtletly and superb style criticised by some as being logic free i dont disagree that some plot turns are flawed eg anyone disposing of a body would not do so in such shallow water why did the blackmailers presume that the main character could come up with in less than hours etc but the taut effortless direction inspired casting elegant cinematography and surprising emotional depth make the deep end a superior and absorbing tale with characters who are truly complex and interesting to watch the terrific performances only enhance the enjoyment as tilda swinton gives a masterly fresh portrayal as margaret hall a good dedicated mother who will do anything for her children and goran visnijic who adds a real humanity to his role of alex spera a initially cold hearted blackmailer whose conscious starts to kick in when he fully realises what he is doing to margaret and her family supporting actors are also solid and raymond barry is convincingly menacing in his two scenes as spera s more vicious crime partner oh and lake tahoe looks absolutely stunning a unique and extremely effective backdrop for this film story excellent 
one of the first and still best television docu dramas in the fall of i gathered with others at a friends house with the intention of going out for the evening by chance a commercial announced that the missiles of october one of television s first attempts at a docu drama the other being the andersonville trial was about to come on we decided to wait a few minutes to see some of it three hours later we were still in our chairs with our coats on silence pervaded the room as the drama unfurled and there was an overwhelming sense of you are there that kept us riveted to the story looking back now i realize that this was one of the greatest stage productions ever made on what then had been somewhat of a mystery to the average american namely what had actually transpired during the thirteen days of intense struggle of october of when the world was on the edge of nuclear armageddon this work is very intellectual superbly written and gripping in dramatic scenes it is important to remember that this was shown during an era of strong anti military feeling the country was winding down from vietnam and to see a positive resolvency of a possible global catastrophe by politicians concerning an incident in from when we were only children reminded us of what america can accomplish when sane men seek safe ways out of conflict there is a lot of good acting the scenes are cleverly done shifting between washington and moscow with tid bits of b w events in the world film thrown in we get to see inside the exec committees of both the white house and kremlin and how they plot strategy attempts to duplicate the success of this stage drama failed miserably pueblo in did not capture the tension and mystique and television has simply never been able to repeat what i now believe was a dramatic miracle of production on screen well recommended 
alice in woody land i bought this film after seeing it many times over the years it s a wonderful take on alice in wonderland woody allen style fine acting the usual glammny nyc scenes and a fantasy any woman can relate to 
not perfect but when the results are so good who cares the best of youth is a wonderful italian miniseries directed by marco tullio giordana that we can now watch thanks to this dvd truth to be told this is the kind of great opportunity you simply have to take advantage of why because this miniseries entertains but also allows you to witness some of the things that happened in italy in the last years from the point of view of two italian brothers nicola luigi lo cascio and matteo alessio boni carati they are both very different but thanks to them their friends and girlfriends we can at the very least have a notion of what happened in italy during those years mafia floods terrorism the red brigades corruption yes but also the transformation of two young men from starry eyed teenagers to adults that struggle with reality and its challenges and find different paths in their lives all in all i can say that i loved this miniseries the best of youth lasts approximately hours but that was not enough due to the fact that you want to know more about the characters and what is going to happen with them in the future of course this series is far from perfect but when the results are so good and manages to transmit so much who cares highly recommended belen alca

bold and inspiring though not flawless brother to brother packs a lot of ambition into its compact running time director rodney evans has interwoven the modern day story of perry a young gay african american artist anthony mackie living in new york struggling to find love and a sense of identity with nothing less than a brief film history of the birth of the harlem renaissance literary movement with its seminal figures langston hughes wallace thurman zora neale hurston and bruce nugent shown in black andwhite flashbacks an aged destitute but still witty and unbowed nugent roger robinson befriends perry in the present and becomes his touchstone brother to brother is perhaps at its best in the flashbacks which vividly capture the excitement and sense of limitless possibility that briefly existed for nugent and his compatriots as they founded the radical literary journal fire they make one want to know more about these people the present day narrative has its virtues as well shedding light on the special problems of gay african americans as well as the struggle to maintain one s artistic identity and integrity the frankness with which male male sex is treated without prurience or heavy guilt is most welcome curiously as another reviewer has mentioned however the couplings shown almost exclusively involve black with white men which undercuts the film s contention that black gay men should celebrate their uniqueness moreover evans protagonist has too many issues to contend with homophobic parents and classmates trying to make a living as a painter boyfriend troubles for everything to fit comfortably within the short allotted time finally it must be said that an actor with greater emotional range than mackie may have been able to bring out more facets of perry who too often seems merely a handsome glum cipher still despite its flaws brother to brother succeeds at illuminating corners of the human experience long neglected in mainstream filmmaking and for this certainly merits praise 
burt s best romantic comedy this film is a perennial favourite with me it s funny warm and charming every time burt plays a man who is reluctantly splitting from his wife candice bergen his brother charles durning and sister inlaw frances sternhagen set him up on a blind date dinner with potential love interest jill clayburgh who tells him to look her up after he is over his break upthere are many funny scenes thanks to the script by james l brooks i liked the divorced men s workshop in the church basement the dates burt went on and the familiar feelings of being elated or trapped during a relationship burt played this convincingly as a lonely vulnerable loveable man who is unprepared for change i highly recommend this film as a feel good romantic comedy 
ultimately beautiful this was a very good film in many ways although it appears to be simple it s quite a complex examination of adolescent confusion fatherly love and hope all within a class status based society that provides the film with a nuanced backdrop xiaochen did frustrate me at times as he s so very often silent and many of his actions are selfish and heartrending considering what it puts his father through i wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake him but that s really one of the many things that s good about this at or kids have a host of pressures put on them a host of confusing things to work through and they don t have the language or the experience yet to deal with it xiaochen is working through all that but he also has the weight of his talent on his shoulders so reasonably enough he s going to struggle to sort it all out the ending of this is frustrating in some ways but ultimately very beautiful also this is a quiet film no bells and whistles but some satisfying complex characterization and quite wonderful music

amistad great film this film is a truly great film it not only tugs at the heart strings but also gives one an insight into what the african people actually endured during the slaving period in history this is perhaps one of the films that schools need to show during black history month as well as any time during the year a definite story that needed to be told 
great adventure i absolutely loved this movie it s fast paced funny exciting and really revived my interest in history parents should definitely watch this with their kids and move forward with any interest in history that their children show afterwards they should come up with something like this for math and science as well 
good stuff this movie is a comedy drama that is about a dull nerdy guy that doesn t have a snowball s chance getting a girl a necklace suddenly changes all of that and he goes on a wild ride to turkey this is definately good stuff from bleibtreu he does a lot more acting in this than run lola run i understand german pretty well but there are a couple of spots that i went back and turned on the subtitles the accents sometimes get a little thick from the cast of characters he encouters 
two myths meet within a century old anthropological myth what a challenge ! to take two characters like aliens and predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge it is unimaginable each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us the audience the situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension the film makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as the old curiosity shop so we revisit pyramid civilizations three aztec egyptian and cambodian and the great myth of all times the antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens the general idea is that the space visitors are the predators that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born for the hunt easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus that s what we are told happened on october and is going to happen again on october unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt in a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators the result is absolutely perfect the human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators hence saving the world and the human race the details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular it reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation all those vain people who believe in money guns science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend this is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences but at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round the film makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book i guess the dvd has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome dr jacques coulardeau university of paris dauphine university of paris pantheon sorbonn 
very moving and great acting i just saw this on dvd after never catching it on television i thought it was a very touching film and was very pleased with the quality of the actor s performances it always saddens me to be reminded how so many countries failed to act in ways that could have saved so many lives such as if they had bombed the railroads and bridges leading to the death camps very engrossing film i was pleased with it 
you don t know the rules scream is a movie that doesn t let go of the thrills and nailbiting moments till the end from the now classic opening scene featuring drew barrymore to the shocking end of this great film the movie revolves around a character named sidney prescott neve campbell one night two of her classmates are brutally murdered and now the killer is after her police believe there is a connection between this killer and the one that killed her mother a year before slowly people around sidney start dying and she has to try to survive and find out who the killer is this movie is mysterious in a way because throughout the movie the killer could be anyone you have no idea who it is until the end of the movie this movie also includes an allstar cast including courtney cox and david arquette i recommend this movie to anyone who loves slasher movies or just loves movies period 
great jessica lange does an excellent job in portraying frances farmer not only does she resemble her physically but her actinig is remarkable and it is no wonder that she won an oscar this movie is incredible and really makes you think about frances farmer and how the mentally ill are treated this movie does have some disturbing images though and i would not recommend it for younger children with those images though it provides you with an actual picture of the horrible brutality in which frances farmer was treated this movie is very good but only to be watched by people that can handle disturbing images 
it s not just giant robot anime if your interested in giant robot anime with a story this is for you other reviews as well as search engines can help you with the story line and deference s between the platinum and perfect collection if you saw it s original basic cable us run on adult swim late night cartoonnetwork you missed some things not many though for one reason or another certain parts where edited out i m not sure if it was for content or time that or i can t remember them all p little tidbits that may not really mean anything unless you ve seen it up to that part were for some reason left out never the less if you have seen or own anime such as coboy bebop flcl samurichamploo this is good price to add it to your collection also the subtitles can clear up a few things as well this is one of the most realistic sci fi anime i have seen there are times you can really relate to the things going on and find the utter stupid ness of real life in this series it s vary deep not for light thinkers and if you wonder why you watched it all the way through after doing so you ve probly missed something it s no doubt that the characters in this have some problems upstairs but you come to understand why later on they kind of breakdown the wall most of the scientific content they talk about is lip service ie esoteric and probly incorrect to those that don t know of it but it can allow the viewer get sucked in at times notethe directors cut s of episodes are here and help with some things and considering your only paying about per disk new as of this date and a nice box to put it in your almost steeling it compared to other sources 
i just want to tell everyone when this movie came out and i saw it at the movietheater you know the scene in the car where tine finally gets enough and hit him back everyone in the theater started yelling and screaming clapping their hands it was awesome and i will never forget it !

funny car legond jim dunn is one of the legonds of drag racing this film offers an amazing glimpse into how it was before all the huge sponsorships hospitality tents multi car crews etc the day when a group of guys can get together and build a car more out of love dedication and hard work than money long gone ! 
great movie the acting writing and complete look of the film are completely fantastic everything is fantastic but jim carrey steals the scenes in a very good way every time he is on the screen he is pure jim the character he plays on the movie is as if it was written just for him he fits is role perfectly the scenery in the movie is very dark and gloomy which sets the perfect tone for the film the costumes suits and dresses all look great and the entire things comes together very nicely overall this is a must see for fans of jim carrey if you love a good movie you will love this like i said this role was made for jc ! 
great show but dvd has poor picture quality i love larry sanders it s just a brilliant show and paved the way for reality tv i was a bit disappointed however in the picture quality couldn t they have at least remastered these they look worse than my comcast reception the picture is actually fuzzy

burn it with the banchee woman i recently bought the step wich came with cathe frederick s basic step after mastering that i felt i should move on to a more intermediate video and after a little online shopping decided to purchase this video youll definitely get your heartrate up doing the minute step workout so make sure to have a bottle of water close by ! the nd minute session will slow it down a bit but your legs will kill you in the end if your legs aren t really strong yet the rd minute session felt more like a cool down for me than anything else it was really nice to lie down and stretch my leg muscles the butt crunches were quite welcomed as well the propulsion moves are not that intriguing i find them to be hard on the knees and they do not benefit your heart rate or fitness aptitude kathy herself is a good instructer i could follow her directions very well however i call her banchee woman because she does these tribal calls when she gets really excited about the exercises it s kind of embarrassing sometimes ! and she also has a man on her team that gives you really alluring looks during the workout that s kind of creepy i have a few complaints as well other than the music being a bit annoying kathy s arm movements she wants you to do these strong arm movements but they are extremely hard to incorporate with the stepping you ll find yourself tripping over your feet while you try to wave your arms around in the patterns she suggests nonetheless the dvd does what it says it gives you toned thighs and buns after a dozen or so run throughs and that to me is the most important part 
cute it s not spectacular and there are better disney movies that deal with the same issues yet resulting in some more laughs but this film is not to be disgarded with a spectacular breakthrough performance by anne hathaway as mia a young socially retarded young girl who find out she is actually the heir to the throne of genosha she of course freaks i mean she s already weird enough now add a tiera her grandmother the spectacular julie andrews is trying to make her presentable enough for the genoshian ball where she will announce mia as the new princess but will she make it that far with her newfound popularity mia is faced with problems she never had before she used to be invisable now she has jealous rivals at her school and kocks now striving to get a taste of her you know because she s famous she s now being used and thats not something she likes this film while not wonderful surely has it s moments and while they may be spaced apart they are still wonderful moments 
on the town new york new york its a wonderful town especially when sailors gene kelly frank sinatra jules munshin have a hour shore leave to see sighs and when those sights include ann miller betty garrett and vera ellen co directed by gene kelly and stanley donen based on the broadway hit on the town changes the landscape of movie musicals opening filmaker s eyes to what could be done on location and when brilliant location and studio production numbers are blended it could be as here embulient up andatm perfection the bronx is up and the batterys down butno one can be down after going on the town super super musical your see a wonderful performance and how n y looks in and buildings and people have gone long time ago it s a time capsule for nostalgic tours transfer in ultra resolution quality picture recommende

the classic original rag tag fleet i really enjoyed the previous reviewer s episode guide i printed it and decided to see how my own humble opinions stacked up to his i especially laughed at his review of fire in space a fire in space after a month of viewing it was fun to see where we saw eye to eye and where we differed saga of the star world a pure classic the bridge sequence is beautifully cinematic this hr pilot offers the very best of galactica lost planet of the gods a the magic continues without falter as the galactica continues its escape from the cylons in this part story the lost warrior b this shane wild west formula worked for me i enjoyed it and the good the bad and the ugly apollo showdown in the end with red eye was perfect the poor dubbing on the barking dog was laughable still it s a cool episode even if it riffs on many western classics the long patrol c this starbuck prison colony episode is a yawner i didn t care for it as much as i liked the previous apollo solo plot i loved watching the actors in the cylon uniforms in one sequence tentatively walk down the stairs in fear of falling the gun on ice planet zero b the whole hoth flavor of this episode worked for me i loved the story and enjoyed the ensemble cast it s a solid part story the magnificent warriors d this episode plays it loose with the whole magnificent seven plot i love akira kurosawa s seven samurai and anything that pays homage to it but this particluar episode is poor the young lords c starbuck crash lands on a planet and helps a group of children rescue their father from the cylons okay the living legend a lloyd bridges guests as commander cain of the pegasus apparently cassiopeia had a thing for him damn he s good ! an excellent part story oh and the very hot anne lockhart as sheba starts here daughter of cain fire in space b a fire in space but man i can t be as harsh on this one i found it exciting it s like towering inferno on the galactica its riveting stuff especially given how atrocious greetings from planet earth was i love the apollo and starbuck on wires bit my year old noticed war of the gods a patrick macnee stars as count iblis he s a long way from the avengers this is a strong part story the science fiction is very star trek here and the exchange between adama and iblis and others is taut with drama great stuff the man with nine lives b fred astaire guests as the alleged father of starbuck the nomen arrive good murder on the rising star c starbuck is accused of murder following a heated exchange with a shipmate during a radical game of triad dig the undies guys greetings from planet earth f you see battlestar galactica was truly ahead of its time with its own take on the alliance prefirefly you ve got ray bolger guesting formerly the scarecrow and mantooth formerly of emergency fame hector and vector perform a little dance number that fred astaire would not do for the show all of this culminates in a part stinker it just isn t compelling sci fibaltars escape c the nomen and baltar team up to hijack not good escape from terra c the ship of lights again ed mulhare of knight rider fame guests it takes a page out of the cold war again not good take the celestra d great idea fairly rediculous silly execution the cylons have all but disappeared since fire in space the hand of god a premium glactica returns along with the cylons where have you been guys final episode here departs in a blaze of glory great stuff but where has boxey and moffat gone they dissapeared with the cylons but never came back remembering battlestar galactica the documentary a terrific nice seeing the entire cast reminisce about their fave episodes and see how they have all aged lovely memories my wife tells me they are not your friends i keep telling her but they are apart from overutilized explosions and dogfights reused launch sequences bad edits and some minor continuity problems one episode starbuck goes from long hair to short to long to short again what it was fantastic to watch these again poking ocassional fun is part of the fun but i was surprised how well this series looked being nearly years old sure the mastering isn t there it would have been wonderful if they cleaned these prints up like they did with star wars but still looked good and the sounded great with the subwoofer a short sweet wonderful series thanks to great characters created with care and well acted by a tremendous cast thumbs way up ! i can see why they brought it back for the sci fi channel s new masterpiece !

it s no quotanalyze this quot but fun romp thru a doozy situation witty theme darker than you d expect and with some dead serious undertones burt young s character for example is scary without a trace of humor but this is totally appropriate in context and gives the movie a punch that many comedies lack hugh grant s comic timing took me by surprise as did jeanne t s convincing rendition of a mafia don s daughter james caan was actually the reason i picked this dvd up and did not regret it very worthy spin for an evening if you like atypical comedies in general or mafia comedies in particular 
makes you wanna dance along with him i absolutely enjoyed this dvd i couldn t keep still it took me back to when i was a teenager listening to these songs and seeing the videos only problem is i wished it was longer but it only for my own selfish reasons haha it s length is perfect but i could listen and watch for hours michael is a true entertainer and those who appreciate true talent will appreciate him as a artist 
fantastic this movie has definitely held up through the test of time the ridiculousness is just as funny today as the first time i saw it ! love this dvd

excellent ab challenge this video challenges your abs in whole different arena than traditional ab workouts i ve got a book and another video with some similar routines but found them hard to incorporate because i couldn t really follow what the writer fitness expert was trying to say this video clearly describes what you should be doing and how you should be doing it as well what you should feel i love to train my abs and this video is definitely a keeper because it ads a lot of non traditional ab work that keeps a workout interesting if sitting on the floor doing crunches is not your cup of tea then you should without a doubt try this video 
vanessa williams is fine but chayanne shines i usually stay away from the chick flick genre that i was forced to watch with my ex wife daughter and prior to that various and sundry dates but from the first viewing of this contagiously exciting film i was drawn into the world of proffesional latin dancing i readily admit that my initial interest was to see vanessa since in my opinion she makes too few films but the infectious sountrack and the easy looking but incredibly intricate dance performances of chayanne and crew made me say to quote a line from the film i want to do that too ! chayanne who is probably a superstar in latin circles gives a utilitarian acting performance however appealing his personality and this whole movie was never in danger of being an oscar contender however i reiterate the dance sequences are exilerating a solid family movie and with the popularity of dancing with the stars should be a must see for fans of that show 
excelente una maravilla para disfrutar con amigos en una reunion y recordar momentos especiales gran imagen y excelente calidad de sonido el concierto es muy reciente 
all that jazz the origional modern musical even by todays standards a cutting edge piece of work i enjoyed it years ago and enjoy it just as much today fun and quirky 
not the best laid film but it gets extra points for originality i must say that best laid plans is in a league of it s own i have never seen a movie that took me for the turns this film did and anyone who says that they guessed the ending is just lying to make their hatred for this movie resonate this film may not be perfect and there are some boring scenes as they try to hard to explain the state nick is in but the overall plot of this film is one i ve never seen done before from the opening scene in the bar when reese enters till you find her chained up in the basement and she tells nick were screwed you start to realize that what you think you know you don tand thats the case throughout this entire movie from the start to the finish you have no clue who s involved in what when nick nivola makes the bad choice of stealing some dope with friends and his friends are caught he ends up at the bad end of the gun he has just a few days to get or he s going to be worse than dead then his friend brice brolin moves back and nick and lissa witherspoon come up with a plan only it backfires and then they find a way out of it but that plan backfires and before you know it their back where they started litterally this movie for all it s twists and turns and originality while not being perfect still is a recomended film for anyone who wants to see something fresh and different than the normal popcorn munching drama stars 
sas meet werewolves werewolves meet sas this film is frightening in a quiet sort of way i enjoyed it immensely it was an especially scary watch considering i was living an hour away from my military base in the backwoods of the thetford forest in the east of england in the middle of the night across from a patch of said spooky forest delicious the plot is solid the special effects adequate to the story the acting good i like that it is so quiet and brings a fairy tale creature into the modern age so deftly without the usual american hollywood theatrics what would a military unit do if met by a group of supernatural beasts hmn this film offers a good answer i do so like werewolves ! check out ginger snaps back the prequel to the corny ginger snaps it is also quiet my inner yearold liked it alot as it is a bit on the young femaleempowerment side watch for the scene that shows just how gutsy ginger is when faced with a jerk of a captain 
it is still a great show it is still a great show it is better than i remebered it 
fantastic entertaining western ! one of the best ever made a true classic ! excellent story fast paced yet slow enough for the viewer to learn character development in my opinion it has one of the best director s of westerns john sturges with a musical score composed and directed by the best man ever to develop a musical score for a western elmer bernstein his music lends to the story and captures human emotion in every secene the acting is superb by a veteran cast of the best actors to be assembled for a film yul bryner steve mcqueen james coburn charles bronson to name a few the interviews are interesting and captivating on the second disk and give you a good a idea of what it was like to work on this film believe me you won t regret buying this two disk version an excellent edition to a film library a great film that you can enjoy over and over again john e matty springfield v
