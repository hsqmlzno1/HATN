offset dialog screens story and picture quality aside it is very annoying that the film seems to have been transferred off center from the opening titles to the dialog boxes anywhere from one to three letters of the printing are missing on the left side of the screen i guess you get what you pay for 
you should refuse to watch i was channel surfing one night and i landed on cent refuse to die at first i thought it was an authorized production but i quickly began to realize that something wasn t right this so called documentary is loaded with hip hop jams but none of them are from fitty or the g unit camp also the majority of the film features some of the crappiest animation i have ever seen there are informative interviews with fitty s grandfather dmc treach and dj skribble but the movie still has a generic feel to it i was glued to the film like someone watching a train wreck i kept wondering why even agreed to narrate this turd up until the credits started rolling the voice of cent was provided by an imposter named leviticus richardson he had me fooled but boy was i pissed remember all the bogus pac cds that hit the streets after he died several wannabes had copied pac s flow to the max and we were bombarded with mackaveli pts to remember the bruce lee imitators this smells like the same doo doo i m not even a fan of today s hip hop but i would love to hear what and company have to say about this i was tricked but there is no need for you to get played avoid this urine stained comic book and watch cartoon network instead 
great movie hddvd worthless goodfellas is a classic cult movie and there is no doubt about it but sorry when it comes to talk about high definition the rating goes to stars maximum there is nothing to be amazed in the hd transfer of this movie because purely and simply there is no hd such a d lookalike pictures deep contrast etc it seems hd need today s technology to render effects in comparaison ray is rendering all the amazing good things of hd in pictures and sound 
not what i thought i bought this movie not from amazon but i got it watched it and then sold it i was hoping for something really cool but instead it made no sense i like weird i like really weird but this was soo weird that i couldn t follow it and from what i ve read i think it was supposed to have some kind of socio political message behind it maybe something was lost in translation or maybe its just bad i wouldn t say don t watch it it has some crazy moments but i would just say its not really worth owning the problem there is that for most people they aren t going to find this one at the video store unless you have a serious alternative indie rental place this is just my opinion though so take it with a grain of salt i wouldn t let you keep me from getting a movie i wanted so get it if it looks good to you other options if you want creepy go with takashi miike s audition if you want twisted go with most anything miike if you want violent twisted and also some cinematic beauty go with chan wook park s sympathy for mr vengeance you may have heard of park s later movie oldboy ultimately more twisted and very good but i like sympathy for mr vengeance better 
fine film ruined by voice overs on this dvd a solid documentary with interesting new footage and invaluable testimony from participants in the battle and related events is ruined by loud voice overs by poor actors both the narration and the voice overs of interviewees are mediocre at best if you are averse to dubbing of fictional films you will understand that overdubbing of non fictional work is particularly onerous clearly a decision was made to create a version that would be accessible to those averse to reading subtitles but in the age of dvd it is fairly absurd not to include the original version of the film 
ugh this one is just bad wow what a disappointment great actors with a god awful script from a fantastic book i loved the book so much i just couldn t wait to see the movie and i missed it theaters so i watched it this weekend from netflix what can i say it s boring ! i m not a huge fan of tom hanks especially with this mullet esque hair its ok to hate me but i love iam mccellan and jean reno but these great actors just couldn t save this movie and sofie neveau was so much more interesting in the book don t waste your time on this one 
larry clark craps again this movie depicts the said goings on of rich kids with too much time on their hand once again larry clark delivers a film which is nothing more than for him to see a bunch of teen kids naked it s kids but with a murder plo 
doesn t hold a candle to the original this is a remake of an affair to remember with cary grant and deborah and it does not work some movies just should not be remade the only thing good about this movie is katharine hepburn s appearance get the original 
oh my what an inexcusable fiasco from universal when i received this for christmas the year of its release i was unaware of the framing issues i had to ship parts and back to them for replacements on top of that there were warbling sound issues with part and the michael j fox interview ran about chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu this was reported on many websites also the trailers were all full screen not widescreen apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the re release the thing that angers me the most is that since i couldnt return part to universal initially ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen ughhhh i can live with it in fullscreen and i am not gonna exchange the set for a set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with universal thanks for nothing pass this one up until its reissued with new features ! 
this movie would have been acted better if they used real retards i can t give it any less than one star but what the heck the girls were hot so there s the one star other than that i am literally dumber after watching this movie ! i swear to god ! i passed out after watching this film because i got so stupid i forgot to breathe ! they should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job ! even if they just ran around the set yelling potato salad march the dialogue would have been times better message to the producer give it up loser 
why why this is a total waste of time and money on disney s part they just don t have that magic that they had in the s i hope something happens because some of the animated movies are losing credibility jmho 
a genuine disaster movie from the producer who gave you the towering inferno comes this hilarious killer bee invasion with a hollywood squares cast including fred macmurray in his final screen role the swarm is another irwin allen schlockfest mired in ludicrous dialogue and unspecial effects this cinematic turkey inexplicably cost a whopping million which makes you wonder about creative bookkeeping a definite must for bad film aficionados 
movies like this make you ask was this sequel really neccessary the original jungle book was inventive whitty uplifting and charming the characters had depth and a beauty that in its time was unique and wonderful the original disney jungle book story was told with great feeling that was a source of fun and inspiration to me growing up as an autistic child i can honestly say the original disney jungle book movie was the only movie i loved that also touched my heart jungle book is is just a very badly executed attempt at recreating the awesomeness of the the original disney jungle book jungle book fails in all attempts to recreate any of the magic of the original disney jungle book jungle book is endlessly bland overall filled with nothing at all to justify wasting a moment of your life watching you will be better and more deeply entertained for hours watching newly poured cement dry compared to watching a moment of jungle book don t waste your time wacthing this garbage it is not worth anyones time or money it gets one star only because the amazon system does not allow me to post zero stars or better still stars in negative numbers 
snore don t let the cover fool you this film isn t half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it s my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove or at least something interesting to watch and it s not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy division new order happy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost came off as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i wouldn t call this bad it had it s good parts just not many 
garbology main line main line those main liners you like to look at those main liners don t you ginger i mean kitty you the suffragette who just got offa the suffragette wagon the same wagon that was seen rolling by in the story of vernon and irene castle wait a minute that was the exact same footage ! i guess the makers of this fine movie assembled it out of stock footage in fact wynn the main liner seems to be assembled out of stock footage of bill clinton did you know allabout the maiiinnne liiiiinnneee seems the whole worl knows about the maiiiiiiinnnneee liiiiiiinnnnnneeeeeee philadelphia aristocracy see in philadelphia they re old skool dig they even got a queen of pennsylvania who sits on a throne and stuff played by margaret dumont when she s not getting scandalized by groucho marx and i believe there is a duke and duchess of bakersfield and just the other day i had tea and crumpets with the viscount of compton of the night train i mean wild i i mean yeah he was drinking ripple back when redd foxx was merely the duke of cornwall he was in line to the throne or was that waiting for the mens room see over here in the states we take our aristocracy just as seriously as our prussian counterparts we are always to be seen marching around with those spiky helmets on saluting the statue of kaiser bill s moustache 
silly disappointing kid movie colorado s san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is myfavorite place to vacation in the usa so when i saw the preview ofdurango kids on another dvd i decided to rent it on netflix it isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish and the kids whilecute outsmart all the stupid adults the first minutes showed somenice locations in and around durango including the steam train thatswhy i purchased a used copy but then it goes into time travel to saveouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore intended for young and undemanding children don t bother unless youlove durango as much as i do 
did they read the book while not one of his best novels tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time ! jimmy smits does his best but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble skip it 
interesting but not instructional i m a huge cl fan and got interested in playing piano in part because of the great music cl plays but while the dvd is interesting it was more style over substance not that that is bad the video s are worth the price but since cl doesn t really read music they never show any music and the teaching is very limited 
the worstof the worst dvds i am really a christina fan but i have no choice on this one other than saying the truth this is the worst dvd i have ever bought in my life i can t encourage anyone to buy this one i don t really know what christina was thinking to release this dvd there is no way i can call this a music video but rather call it a slide dvd coz what you should expect to see are just slides about her biography and no music at all i regret having bought this dvd i repeat don t buy this one this is really discouraging anyway if you have nothing to do with your money then you can buy this one better buy the stripped one not this one 
role model far from it jessica simpson is a talentless bimbo she is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing brittany and christina for showing too much skin we all know now that the hypocritical jessica simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right she is not a role model and her songs tv specials are lower than below average 
annoying lear i didn t enjoy the film i also didn t enjoy the original play by shakespeare king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays i don t consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done and to add nothing of value to the original you can set it wherever you like in medieval japan or on the moon what s the difference it s king lear a downer of a play there s nothing great about ran just as there s nothing great about lear and it takes up three hours of your time a moron named lear or hidetoro or whatever his name is relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father he is right of course and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily he s wanted dead or dead in this treatment of the annoying plot he loses his mind he has a faithful follower or two they overact there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk am i supposed to care what happens to him why because he used to be a powerful king and a cruel one you may as well cry over saddam hussein look at this movie with fresh eyes look at shakespeare s king lear with fresh eyes this stuff simply is not very entertaining and is not very good the hell with king lear he s an annoyance 
it s bad in a very bad way i try very much to be openminded when it comes to horror movies but this it s so bad my eyes started to hurt bad idea and very bad acting its so bad i barried it deep deep down in my garden so no man could ever reach it again 
the only movie i ever fell asleep at when the original the grudge came out it was a shocking very scary experience at the theater i was jumping in my seat i saw the original when i was up to that point it was one of the scariest movies i d ever seen and i ve loved horror scary movies since i was four years old i really like sarah michelle gellar i think she s a great actress and i always like her movies i was a fan on buffy so i was excited that she would be in the sequel to my disappointment she had about minutes of screen time in the grudge i was really looking forward to the sequel but i was actually shocked at how bad it turned out to be i really couldn t believe how terrible it was it was nothing like the original the grudge it lost all of it s spark not one part of the whole movie was even remotely frightening not one part the grudge was the only movie in my entire life where i actually fell asleep in the theater i never thought the day would come where i would fall asleep in the theater it was that boring and uninteresting unfortunately i didn t fall asleep for very long i really tried to like this movie i wanted to like this movie but i just couldn t there were so many different ways they could have taken the sequel but they turned into something that could have gone straight to video the japanese version of the sequel was much better than this if you must see it rent it 
fear as subtle entertainment plot revealed an utterly worthless foray into english overbearance and haughtiness this film marks hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of fear as subtle entertainment in the pre war s working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in london to indoctrinate subordinate english audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of germany hitchcock eases the tension by making this a comedywasting the first half on indulgent emptiness the scene at an austrian hotel where the boring brits are talking about cricket and drinking tea he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations the fight scene in the baggage cart for example his support for the upper brit classes is especially drab and tedious meandering between hero worship and idolatry not to mention the wooden acting of the actors the story concerns a secretive plot about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the austrian alps simplistic innocuous even but hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue doesn t want to think she imagined it all of course she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by evil men immature plot definately banter insipid and devoid of any vivacity is exchanged between high brow english snobs in the most elusive way bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train this is nourishment for those who can t think very well the story continues until the stuffy pretentious oaf like english on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema the brits debating the attack itself for minutes in proper english sit there in front of open windows with one gun and hold off well armed foreign agents for minutes also in this scene the year old woman spy jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily how well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off if you can believe in the superiority of british snobs then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film of course you can guess the ending the woman falls in love with the english chap who helped her on the train and england is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid s but most audiences will take this as merely a thriller instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in ideology of propaganda 
confusing story line but what i understood was okay the problem here is the script or perhaps the directing or the editing wherever the blame lies the story of the movie just isn t clearly enough delineated to keep you involved the whole time there are some touching scenes some good acting some moments that make you think and feel but overall it just doesn t stack up too bad too because there s some good performances here the only thing they did well is promote kentucky fried chicken makes you wonder if the whole film was thought up by kfc advertising execs as a way to promote their restaurants guess that failed as hardly anybody s ever heard of this film 
amazon extremely slow to deliver item purchased jan th and as of march th it still has not been shipped 
you ll never get rich this is not one of fred s better efforts the dancing is so so and rita hayworth is among his poorest dance partners lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the astaire rogers films in spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching 
one of the stupidest movies i ve ever seen adam sandler plays a painfully shy man who has extreme fits of violent anger and has to deal with sisters constantly interferring with his life he calls a phone sex line one evening and is then hounded by the man running the service this takes place the same time he meets a woman who likes him despite his oddities the sad thing is i think there is probably a sweet poignant love story in this film but it s buried in a morass of pointless scenes and a discordant soundtrack that is sometimes so loud it nearly drowns out the dialog there is no reason shown why emily watson would fall in love with sandler it s really just one strange scene after another that in the end is dull and left me wishing i d rented another movie 
be warned i bought this on the basis of the various glowing reviews it received here this is terrible the documentary is glib over sentimentalised and downright embarrassing a lot of the time the photography is bad too the performance far from being as fine as some would have you believe is certainly a student one playing is very very ordinary and the conducting dull and lifeless my old supraphon recording with neumann is a billion times better than this in every way 
mortal kombat annihilated such a sad sequel to the best video game movie mortal kombat anilhilation was anihilated the day it was made the story was poorly done i didn t like how the characters act in this film jax williams acts like a afician american stereotype sonya hess acts like a weak little bitch sindel vander acts like one of those pathetic villianess you see in those direct tovideo films that have dumb villianess and brian thompson should be a shame of himself such a good character actor playing a pethetic shao khan one thing that sucks in this film is that radien remar and shao kahn are brothers and shinnok schore is their father what a pathetic change to add in this film raiden and kahn are far from family and shinnok and kahn don t even like each other and they re not father and son in the game this film cost million yet the special effects in this film look so cartoony in fact i ve seen playstation one graphics look better than that this film is really bland and john r leonetti directing style sucks if you wanna watch a sequel to mortal kombat just watch yourself playing mortal kombat on midway s arcade greatest hits on playstation and xbox 
remember when you thought talking genitals were all the rage ultimately nothing more than a snuff film for girls who like to get it on with the same sex via an alpha male vessel spikester goes to great lengths to make his locker room talk experiment seem a product greater than the sum of its parts coffin size office floors psychic monkey sidekicks a cabinet that spills onto an exit ramp dysfunctional imps who made faces at the dinner table when they were kids and the faces stuck pinocchio fetishes watching being john malkovich appears to be a bit like going to a carnival put on by aphex twin i d rather drill holes through my kneecaps so i can whistle while i walk 
good for a while but geez then george peppard shows up the opening minutes of this movie is pretty interesting it reveals the nazi struggle to launch the v rocket and the british effort to figure out what the germans are up to the story of hanna reitsch a top female nazi test pilot is a movie in of itself her scenes are very good also paul henreid of casablanca fame victor lazlo plays a nazi general it is interesting to see him years after casablanca but then the great wooden actor george peppard makes his appearance you talk about a movie losing steam it loses steam quicker than a tea kettle taken off a hot stove the plot then becomes dreary and dreadful and predictable and it becomes for me a star film the incredibly sexy sophia loren is in the movie but they have her dressed in a dark blue turtleneck sweater you can t even see her beautiful body what a waste she was married to the producer so i guess she worked cheap at several points in this epic they use black white wwii stock footage its a color movie its laughable as is most of the acting 
really awful movie about wealthy cheatingold gay men really awful movie about wealthy cheatingold gay men and the boys they seduce this movie was disgusting a year old pianist who has a partner of similar age meets a boy of who admires him and has sex with him while on a business trip likewise his old partner also hires prostitutes while the pianist is on the road i guess if you have an open relationship or if you think cheating on your partner is cool or if you re an older guy who fantasizes about younger guys you might like this movie the boy also plays piano but always gets selected for the page turner role mom doesn t know the boy is gay but later figures it out at the end of the movie i got the impression that the boy may have been trying to sleep his way into the music business but i wasn t sure about that no matter the infidelity between the old and young generation was disgusting even more so because of the cheating that went on don t bother renting this movie 
japanese goosebumps this film is at walmart ! the japanese goosebumps ! twilight zone wannabes ! yeah it s good good to laugh at ! the sacrafice should have been packaged alone for i would have been satisfied

candyman the day of the dead director turi meyercast tony todd donna d errico alexia robinson jsu garcia mark adair rios lupe ontiveros elizabeth guber rena riffel ernie hudson jr running time minutesrated r for bloody violence and gore sexuality and language the third in the series derived from a concept by clive barker day of the dead they can t even come up with their own subtitle staggers down the well trodden path already navigated by the halloween and nightmare on elm street movies that is taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet the original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine this one is just a load of rubbish donna d errico from baywatch what a spectacle of credibility stars as caroline mckeever the great great granddaughter of the feared candyman tony todd once again once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest as the candyman hacks his way through various bad actors caroline teams up with new pal david nick corri to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the candyman while he was still alive which may hold the key to stopping him theres not a single thing here that isn t scavenged from the first candyman film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days the screenplay is so lazy it can t even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot the photography is bright and glossy which is at odds with what s supposed to be a dark story while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all anyone could have directed this movie so little effort has been put in to make it scary while the ending is an outrageous cop out no thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having d errico running around in a variety of tight vests the rest of the performances are poor too although none are quite as bad as d erricos pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically surely more can be done with characters like the candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone s stomach the fact that the makers of this movie think candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can t be bothered even to try something a bit different clive barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be but he s right about one thing the sequels to his movies are garbage 
not worth your time or money i saw this movie cause i love horror and i love halle but this movie just sucked 
not good just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i m a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging 
terrible fake sleazy cheap disappointment i must admit that when i heard this movie was in the works i was giddy with excitment when i heard that stallone was writing it i became a little less excited but still optimistic being a huge cart fan this was going to be the movie that helped define the league how unfortunate that this movie turned out to be a steaming pile of cow manure ! the plot is ridiculous the action is not even remotely close to real life the special effects look worse than most s video games i ve never seen a movie with more potential go so horribly wrong it s too bad that cart ended up going bankrupt after this movie who knows maybe if the movie was halfway respectable it could have helped cart s financial woes if you are a racing fan i would advise that you watch this movie only so that you know how laughable it is also you will then know how not to make a movie 
is this funny still yet i honestly can t tell seasons one two three go man go ! season four the one to forego speaking as a fan who was first stupefied amazed astonished by bob and david back when they were the kings of megaphone crooning people didn t want to hear songs about things that hadn t even been invented yet ! they wanted to hear songs about new things that is speaking as the rare fanatic the rare mister mr show raising his voice on amazon who laughs just as hard at the good g rated sketches as he does at the good nc rated sketches i find season four the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless ms sketches available in one package funnyguy bob odenkirk reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life says that four was the season when wellcrafted sketches were in absurdity for absurdity s sake was out no longer he claims was mr show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers translation they dumbed it down for the audience andor horsing around in the writers room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat facing the corner enticing as the term is wellcrafted here seems to mean warmed over snl type stuff as in spicing up the world s th jerry springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is funny incongruity and ladling on the same gay panic the same class anxiety that makes the real springer show such a howl overall ms s concepts become less novel less thinky less left fieldfunny with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true what i mean is a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid guy raunch humor but at least sgrh is a species of comedy i haven t nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies and accounts for at least of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts excelsior excelsior n slender curved wood shavings used especially for packing originally a trademark this set did make me grin a few times over the course of five and a half hours one and only one sketch makes me laugh out loud the phenomenon of monster parties as documented in novelty songs such as halloween shindig draculas pajama party and the like examined with pitch perfect tabloid tv grammar original bent premise anchored by yet another simultaneously vicious and sympathetic david cross performance for the most part the gang seems tired like they re having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not funny surely anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass 
master and commander cthe biggest problem with this movie is crowe he cannot act ! the story is a little far fetched and not believable 
possibly the worst movie i ve seen i purchased this movie without reading the reviews based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i ve seen the two main stars in this movie was awful and the sad part is there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout the acting was obviously overdone on purpose i just wish i knew why it didn t come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent in the end i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it 
the american president great movie excellent acting ! annette benning is priceless as the love interest in this film about a widower in the white house he seeks a relationaship with an environmental lobbyist of all things and though their relationship is open and above board the politicians use it against the incumbent during his run for reelection politics are ugly but truth prevails in this optimistic movie my husband and i love this one and we have watched it many times we always love the ending because we enjoy love winning and truth being stronger than bad politics easily one of my favorites 
only for lucy desi diehards this is a terrible movie when it came out in it was a box office bomb even though both stars were at the height of their powers time had only added to it s mediocrity 
awful sometimes brainless action movies can be at least entertaining but this movie does not deliver i couldn t even finish watching it on cable really idiotic ! and this from the same director who made man on fire 
another waste of a possible good movie umm the title says pretty much how i feel about this movie soo much potential but it chokes they are a few nice scenes but not enough to watch it again and who really wants to see terry bradshaw s body come on that was sick 
misses the point while some critics can argue with dan brown s research and reasoning on certain historical points one thing these da vinci debunking presentations will never be able to refute is this the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity primarily by the catholic church and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out years ago with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still quite frankly shocking and debasing sorry but upon this rock of male dominancy was built the church thank you again dan brown by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations obscurations and lies these obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources worth trillions through guilt control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power and those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty dan browns put together people are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been jesus actual relationship with the women in his life or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive men s club with jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship to answer these questions some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self interest or from spiritual corruption the next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the vatican thrown open for public view lord only knows what plunder they contain 
boy is this a stupid movie forty years ago hogan s heroes worked because it was pure farce and its german pow camp was acceptable as a setting for a comedy while life is beautiful failed in large part because a german concentration camp is not a place to set humor i was told this was a charming movie with a lot of joy within it joy despite the misery is what someone said i found it ridiculous boring and an insult to the memory of those who were murdered by the third reich roberto benigni wasn t funny just manically irritating the actor needs either animal tranquilizers or a punch in the mouth i m not sure which maybe both life is beautiful was a horrible film that shocked me with its idiocy far fetched plot turns and overall annoying awfulness start to finish how filmgoers ever fell for this incredibly unfunny waste of time baffles me 
beware years old does not mean it is tame for kids i purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since gone with the wind give me a break this movie had an agenda years ago and it still comes across that way in the rating of pg is a joke please do not watch this movie with your kids ! it is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think the plot is lame and i am sorry i spent the money on it i plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where i can get something that is entertaining this certainly was not i did not even reach the end of the first disc before turning it off for top names in the industry making this film all i can say is they got paid a lot of money for nothing 
don t let go of your old copy this is a mixed blessing star is for the dvd stars for the movie i don t need to say anything about the film those familiar with bava s work know this is among his masterpieces i m writing this review to clear up some things about this new unslashed edition on the positive side this version is anamorphic widescreen and it does present noticeably more picture information on the right and left sides of the frame the old vci version was leterboxed a where as this one is x now the bad news the color and contrast have been boosted altered to the point that the image appears blurrier grainier and more damaged than the previous version also the interior sets especially in the fashion house have a putrid yellow green hue to them not present in the old version the soundtrack is horribly remixed making the dialogue sound like it was recorded in a tin can and it pops quite a bit through the opening of the film the french and italian audio channels are reversed none of these audio problems are present on the old version by the way to top it off the dvd menus are gaudy and offputting trying to make this seem like a bloody slasher pic in summution the extra picture information just doesn t outweigh all of the drawbacks of this edition my advice is to hold on to your old release until something better comes along thanks for reading jwh 
one of the worst zombie flicks ever i m addicted to bad movies really bad movies ones that make you laugh at its pure inadequacy and the ones that are so cheesy that you can t help but be entertained then there are ones that are so bad you would have to be a masochist to sit throughout the entire duration of it ed wood s bride of the monster burial ground and manos hands of fate are three classic horrible movies that i have had the dishonor of seeing and will never forget the pain and boredom that i felt while suffering through the viewing of them hell of the living dead is definitely one terrible zombie flick that certainly and positively belongs among the worst movies ever made first of all it basically covers all of the zombie cliches ever created throughout the history of zombie movies jungle savages mad scientists a little gore a little blood extremely fake looking special effects a random soldier dancing in a green tutu top hat and cane and really really bad zombie make up makes this movie well worth watching also i can t understand why this movie is on the video nasties list i spit on your grave and the last house on the left are much more disturbing than this movie in any case you should check this movie out if you want something to make you fall asleep quickly or if you are a true masochist and desire great amounts of suffering and pain 
this movie fails and are best leave out why is the title named jaws d where are the d glasses i mean the effects are just horrible i enjoy the rest of the series but this one is just boring they should re release this movie in theater with d glasses and i would probably give this movie a good rating but for now this movie just sucks 
domestic life well acted but with little insight some people praise we don t live here any more as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples tired of lies not really knowing what to do it is also true that naomi watts and mark ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting the film as a result looks like a filmed version of some john updike novels actually it is based on two shorts by andre dubus whose killings became in the bedroom but sorry updike is not my favorite author and the film s touch is too desultory for me no desultory is not the only real problem because i remember i was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful in the bedroom the real flaw of we don t live here any more is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters mark ruffalo s character jack is having affair with naomi watt s edith and jack s wife laura dern already suspects or knows that his husband is cheating but the affair means here uninspired clichd sex scenes between edith and jack among the woods in oregon with naomi watts and mark ruffalo having sex against a tree ala fatal attraction edith husband hank peter krause teaches creative writing and has just one book published the alcoholism of laura dern s character is suggested in the most obvious way you know what but in the first place why didn t the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big clich among these recycled materials there are a few well observed descriptions that deserve attention it is the brief but efficient study of the children in both families and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart these clever insightful moments however do not last long in the film for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in america we don t want any big surprises or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning it is true that we don t live here any more presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in america but the film goes nowhere from there missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters 
made me ashamed to have served this is the first time that i ve ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie i thought was horrible but this movie is that bad i can t believe someone actually enjoyed this the one liners and that whole rock candy thing what was that all about was that supposed to be funny who wrote this anyway he should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time the acting was also some of the worst i ve seen i will never be able to watch terminator again oh the explosions were impressive maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn t be too bad thanks i feel a little dumber for having sat through the whole thing 
movie is top dvd is a flop this dvd gets only stars because the tv screen format of this dvd production is really ridiculous but the movie is one of my favorites number on my all time best movies list the feel of the movie is more like that of a typical s sci fi movie like andromeda than of a s movie austere and unemotional like colossus himself quietly and punctuously narrated minimalistically acted and with minimal action a movie for the brain as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world i like the outdated look of the technology in the movie black andgreen screens led displays printout terminals etc really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the s and captures then reasonable appearing fears of computers surpassing human beings attention ! spoiler ! the movie has no happy end the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end just as it is in d f jones novel colossus on which the movie is based and that s another reason why i like the movie so much one of the few movies without a forseeable and boring happy ending the absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending by the way contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer this movie almost has the quality of a kubrick 
in a word horrid it pained me to sit through this movie and i would have turned it off after the first ten minutes if i didn t have to write a comparative analysis between it and shakespeare s othello the writing is terrible the acting is so so the music is the pits there is way too much emphasis on race and the relationship between odin and desi is a joke i m supposed to believe he went stark raving mad over a girl he had been dating for four months give me a break i ended up laughing through the majority of this movie simply because it was so bad this is teenaged melodrama at its worst 
i thought he already lost the election why s he still campaining hopelessly misguided overwhelmingly biographical smartly directed al gore s never ending struggle to prove that mankind is destroying the earth and that the solution is international governmental control and primitive living reared its ugly head on the silver screen earlier this year and is now available on dvd ! beware though that dvd is made of plastic which is derived from a number of chemical compounds including gasp oil the recipe for the movie however is part science parts personal anecdotes and parts slideshow fun mr gore has taken the liberty of inventing a scientific consensus this is of course after he invented the internet on which to start his new campaign for president his movie is almost entirely about his own life a fair amount is devoted to his current struggle to advance the environmental movement and what is left over is a small amount of very misleading science it isn t necessarily bad science it is just far from representational however i won t waste this review debating the scientific ideas advanced by mr gore there are plenty of other scientists and resources for that what needs to be recognized about this movie is that it is a campaign video and not an educational documentary there are components of informative dialogue and presentations but this is really all about al gore not global warming there is more discussion of how his political opponents have got in his way and in the way of his message than there is of actual solutions to the problem this is my big criticism the movie masquerades as a documentary to advance an environmental cause when it really intends to advance al gore s availability for political office even in that light it still operates dishonestly mr gore chastises the bush administration for refusing to take action to stop global warming however even when gore was running the country with bill clinton they did nothing in fact gore s proclamation in the movie that he tried diligently to get kyoto passed but was stopped by the republicans is bogus the clinton administration found the protocol unworkable and challenged the fact that it only bound a few nations to action without timetables they never even submitted it to the senate for ratification in this fashion the movie continues with one dishonest claim after another in the end the movie is full of misleading science and statistics complete lies and fabrications and it focuses more on the nobility of gore than on any perceived global issue the only thing that makes me give it a second star is the fact that it was smartly directed and well edited the message that the movie intended to convey comes across loud and clear and with style it s just not a message that anyone should hear or trust 
fatally flawed sure this movie is a classic but is it any good frankly i found it to be tedious in the extreme its certainly pleasant to look at the sets are quite amazing and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful the story as described in detail in many other reviews here has potential as both a thriller and a thought provoking essay ultimately it is neither the acting is top notch as are all of the special effects those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory in fact all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic but the whole thing never rises to its premise its thriller aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed the only key that can stop the nuke ! the resolution is an afterthought a quick fix in the extreme and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is narrowly whew averted the characters are thin at best and stock at worst this movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early s thought technology would be like in the mid s yawn i must laugh at the whole bell paper bit it means nothing to the plot and is the ultimate contrivance if a deadly virus actually came back from space there would certainly be action on many fronts with plenty of interesting conflict to go around some people would try to understand it others would want only to kill it there s some potentially interesting tension right there some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public others would want to warn them again that could have been a good source of tension someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon mentioned in passing but never developed while others would try very hard to prevent that more tension im just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow moving scenes which it actually contains this movie is the poster child for boring science fiction and it would not have had to be that way i haven t read the book but i bet it s a lot better at its core this movie is a boring dud 
can t tell much about the movie because the transfer is the pits from what little i could make out this may have been good i can t say because this is so poor that at times you can t hear a thing and the static and grain are all over the picture the pits leave it alone and spend your money on something worth whil 
don t buy this the film makers of this piece of garbage misrepresented themselves as a film crew for the bbc everyone interviewed in it were lied to and edited in a way that would make situations appear different than they were eyeball records did not knowingly agree to be involved in this dvd this is typical british tabloid junk save your money 
stupid i m going to make this review quick and to the point i m not going to include any synopsis or anything i m just gonna say this this movie ended up in my recommendations and when i read about it it sounded kind of interesting despite all the negative reviews this movie isn t disgusting as some people have said it is there is elements of nudity sex incest s m and what have you but it s not disgusting the problem with the film is that it s dull it s got a good cast including isabelle huppert the piano teacher and louis garrel the dreamers but the film is just a boring mess even the sex scenes don t help it along the plot is pretty stupid i mean this is really a waste of time grade 
shuttle discovery s historic mission bluray being a new blu ray owner i was anxious to acquire some high resolution material this was one of three discs in my first order and a quick lesson in shopping blind for full disclosure i will reveal that we only watched about the first half of the feature before hitting eject at best of this program was high res mostly familiar footage of ground based nasa training etc all of the shuttle lift off and orbital footage was standard res or worse presented as a documentary and fully narrated very disappointing and a waste of money the other two discs in the order were quite nice 
cliche ridden predictable mainstream mellowdrama from the moment that we are introduced to the main characters in annapolis it becomes apparent who is going to do what and what is going to happen annapolis revolves around jake james franco a ship builder s son with big dreams of being a naval officer naturally he s the underdog who seeks to come out on top with tyrese gibson providing his superior officer and rival who lets him know that he wont make it throw in an annual boxing tournament and everyone involved and annapolis transforms into rocky in the navy only the real loser of the bout turns out being the viewer franco and gibson are stiff and wooden the screenplay is cliche ridden predictable goes out of it s way to be politically correct and inoffensive and sometimes just non sensical apparently eating candy bars wrapped in wonder bread can help one achieve a chisled physique while the inevitable outcome will surprise no one at all jordana brewster is here for looks and not much else and poor donnie wahlberg and chi mcbride are two of the very few bright spots in this otherwise boring crowd pleaser with justin lin directing annapolis is a disappointment considering how surprisingly lively better luck tomorrow was but then again i wasn t expecting a whole lot out of this film to begin with and you shouldn t either 
pretentious boring political un real thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks heartfelt lyrics and a lot of pretty lights so it goes with some reviewers of this movie this movie contains the unending internal reflections of about or different characters these reflections never really go anywhere never draw substantive conclusions primarily there is just a lot of whining the only exception is the sean penn character until the end when he whines at least as much as everybody else war is tough is one of the main themes of this movie is that really a revelation one thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to play opposites meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides an example is when a very evil character such as richard iii uses humor ill have her but not for long the fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us at the same time perhaps we can t avoid laughing in spite of ourselves ok so this director had some of the same classes i did but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and until it starts seeming boring and banal war scene lots of dying oh look a pretty butterfly ! more blood and bullets oh gee the light going through that leaf is beautiful ! use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble this director must use it times he turns it into a cliche when the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite you have overdone it so what do we have so far a bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes and really that s pretty much it the movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is it is redundant it is spoon feeding you the same message over and over and over again ouch war hurts ! ew mutilated bodies are yucky oh gosh a little bird got hurt we are so nasty ! we must stop this war never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day the director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war which i suppose would be briliant except i think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient it s almost as if the author doesn t believe we know that he somehow thinks we missed it and if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity again and again and again well then maybe we will get it and start opposing wars i guess never mind about hitler and the million jews never mind about pearl harbor war is a yucky thing done by bad men or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men it has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it we were just wasting our time fighting the nazis the nazis were just misunderstood ! if they want to cook million jews in the ovens let them do it an adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like how do i get myself to do something that i don t want to do but that i know i should making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood this movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks if i whine enough can i get out of my chores the dumbest scene in this movie is when the jim caveziel character is surrounded by japanese and for no reason whatsoever will not surrender he stands there in the middle of about japanese soldiers and decides after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies to raise his weapon so they will shoot him the funny thing is it s completely unnecessary his comrades have already been warned his death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues i think if you are a left winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys you will love this movie it s the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant unquestioning mind will eat up if your leanings are more adult however you may hate it you ll wonder why the story is so one sided why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for even though the japanese did attack us and the germans did some naughty things too none of that seems to matter to the storyteller why can t we all get along he cries as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat a final note if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the war spirit and how wars are conducted see gallipoli and or breaker morant these movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters the characters are real and the plots move the story foreward the thin red line is what i would call professed brilliance a couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience but there is no real meat here it s just a bunch of pointless whining the poetry is poorly written and pretentious and the characters are not real 
can we fix it no we can t this show is extremely stupid including that blue machine it is stupid and if this ever made a movie i would give it seven thumbs down when i saw a commercial on nickelodeon bob the builder is smaller than a yearold i give this television show out of 
oversell wasn t perticularly thrilled was expecting more classical tap dancing i wish the product details had specified that it was more new age at least i would have known what to expect 
too much story missing in film we need the peter jackson of lord of the rings trilogy fame to do this book justice the book mists of avalon was wonderful this film was chopped up and missing so much that it wasn t really worth watching in my humble opinion a waste of wonderful actors terrible job on screen play get peter jackson and his production company busy on this 
no form of escape with a pacing that only tsai ming liang could love and deliberate scenery shots that you are forced to enjoy house of sand steps into the genre best described as the foreign doldrums moving as fast as thick molasses never wins any points in my book and considering that that seems to be the main goal of this film we didn t get along too well the entirety of the movie takes place in the brazilian desert a place that we movie fans rarely get to see however as you may have guessed not a lot happens out there there isn t even a weeping camel out there to keep us company we watch as a crazy old guy moves his family out into the middle of nowhere no explanation given and then dies stranding everybody else there for three generations i know how can i criticize a plot for not having any developments other than the startling revelation that somewhere out yonder sells salt when in reality nothing would ever happen to these characters and to that i would say that this was not the best yarn to commit to film pretty much everything goes as would be expected people walk around bored some of them die off there are some minor romances and everything looks beautiful about ten years in a group of soldiers shows up and aurea the crazy man s wife desperate for anything that moves strikes up a love affair with one of them he promises to take her out of the desert but unforeseen problems prevent that from happening throughout more soldiers will arrive and the females will always view them as tickets out of town there to be seduced and exploited do i believe that these fellow travelers are the only way these women could escape their destiny maybe maybe not in the end the point is made that living in the brazilian desert is just about the same as living on the moon to which i would have to think that moving your family into the middle of the desert and then croaking might to be too smart another minor complaint i would like to air is the usage of the same actors to play different roles it would be fine in a three times kind of way had they bothered to label the passage of time instead i was left playing catch up thinking that somehow the grandma had risen from the grave there is a fairly graphic sex scene somewhere in the middle that might shock you out of your slumber but really the only use it has is spicing up this overtly bland stew you have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch a movie like this and even then it is nearly impossible for the director to pull off rain and elephant leap to mind as masterpieces of this technique these characters really may have been marooned out in no man s land but unfortunately for the filmmakers the exit of the theater is just a few short steps away i wasn t lucky enough to have seen this in theaters but i would have been mighty interested to see how many people took a walk awe inspiring cinematography does not make a movie and here is my proof 
psuedo anime okay this is starting to piss me off why the heck are there so many anime imitations coming out its so freakin annoying the people who made this think they can do anime but they cant the charcaters are lame the story is totally cliche d and the voiceacting is horrible the thing that makes me mad is the fact that true authentic anime like inu yasha cowboy bebop and akira are totally shunned by much of the american public while this crap is considered great it s totally unfair americans just can t do anime they try but they cant so they should stop trying 
not appropriate for children i agree with jane ! i bought this video for my four year old son because he s a spider man fanatic little did i know that this series is not meant for children when we started to watch with him i couldn t believe what i was hearing so i flipped the box over to find the rating never dreaming there was one since i bought this in a toy store right next to a stack of teletubbie videos there is a pgv rating on the back for violence but they don t tell you about the adult language as well as the sexual references needless to say we shut it off and tried to distract him with a more appropriate video for his age i don t know if i d let my year old watch this 
tasteless humor if you rather bypass lackluster comedies along the line of adam sandler s water boy and chris farley s almost heroes then do not waste your time watching rocketman rocketman has comedian harland williams as fred randall who can land a nasa team on planet mars randall does not appear as your typical rocket scientist his personality resembles dennis the menace always poking his nose in places he does not belong we are expected to laugh at this misbehavior but the tasteless humor is nothing we haven t seen before and the outcome of every incident is easily predictable except for one scene when clumsy randall loses the american flag down in a canyon he then pulls out his usa boxer shorts to mark the territory that carryover live on national television the site of mars looks adequate to its dull counterpart only sand occupies the orange planet in contrast it d have been interesting had mars inhabit alien life form shown in ghosts of mars or total recall william sadler as commander overbeck is more like randall s baby sitter every stupid question randall has to say gets turned down it s not funny when a grown man imitates a child by saying are we there yet they never get along with each other overbeck takes nasa seriously whereas randall is a complete nutcase jessica lundy as julie ford is surely adorn by male hormones her wholehearted blue eyes and fireball red hair unquestionably makes her the real star in this comedy although the chimpanzee came close at second not a memorable comedy for adults to watch children should enjoy the outdated comedy because to them its humor will be fresh 
worst movie ever made without a doubt this is the worst movie ever made in any genre in any decade by any movie making company since the begining of motion pictures who ever put sandra bullock s image on the cover of the dvd should be arrested for false advertising since sandra is only in the movie a few minutes and isn t very good in her role anyway what a bomb and that s an understatement don t rent it don t buy it and don t ever watch it unless you are completely without anything to do and want to find out for yourself just how bad a movie can be 
who decided to make this train wreck i have always hated the coy sex comedies of the early sixties men taking advantage of women who had to protect their virtue who could possibly have thought a remake would be a good idea this is no tribute its a virtual copy of something that was witless and offensive to begin with i watched this on cable just to see if renee zellweger really took part in a movie as bad as this looked and she did and it was no update no twise just a pastiche of bad movies even the clothes were so over the top that poor renee looked like a child playing dress up 
the downhill slide begins in earnest if season four saw homicide lots lose its footing season five was the one in which it slipped and began sliding downhill in a hurry everything that was so brilliant about the first few seasons gets tossed aside here gone are so many of the brilliant characters like crosetti felton bolander and russert the strongest characters who remain giardello pembleton and howard are largely relegated to the background in their places are the one note kellerman the obnoxious brody and the grating cox before this season the show was largely about the interpersonal dynamics of the squad room and how that added up to a functional police unit in season five each character is isolated by ever more contrived personal crises the newer actors bring hystrionics and annoying acting tics to a show in which subtlety and wry nuance used to take center stage gone too this season are some of the best writers on the show and their replacements show only the most superficial understanding of what make these characters tick bayliss lewis and munch are caricatures of themselves in these episodes and giardello is pushed so far into the shadows it s suprising that yaphet kotto isn t just given a guest starring credit oh and the original brilliant opening credit montage with it s overexposed gritty urban scenes and unsettling percussion is replaced with a csi esque montage of forensic gobbledegook and bleating sound effects the original perfectly encapsulated the mood of the show the new one completely misses the point by all means get the first four seasons more perfect television has never been made but only get season five if you can t sleep at night without knowing how andre braugher plays a person recovering from a stroke six and seven you can skip altogether 
sour note no wonder they didn t produce any other live action productions of dr seuss books until after his death this film gave me a headache the direction and pacing of the film is flat the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring inexplicably nominated for an oscar ! the acting was wooden the sets were garish and ugly at least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of dr seuss works were i think dr seuss works best in small doses like the short animated tv shows that were made some thirty odd years ago do check out the gerald mcboing boing cartoon thats included on the disc it contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than dr t does in ninety minutes 
hey where is flower drum song this collection has a serious handicap in the omission of flower drum song this gem is not available at all on dvd what a loss to all

a young vanity nude weird movie this is a very bizarre movie some ape creature becomes friends with vanity on an island where only she and her lover are her lover becomes jealous and then later the ape creature and he battle over vanity appears to be a dream vanity is cute and nude in the movie but she hardly looks like herself very odd movie if you are looking for vanity nude you are better off getting a copy of pickup a better movie or action jackson she shows skin in both here she does have a full frontal scene but it is not all that long anyway 
poor man s truth serum caffeine and sugar there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama revenge films such as eye for an eye it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end whilst the victim or top billed actor actress comes out as the hero at the end it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort but for this critic it is getting old eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film from the opening credits of this film you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end the pauses could be guessed the lines could have been written the night before and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic the violins would always shrill around kiefer and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere this is your typical revenge film with no excitement no frills nothing that would make it stand out from the rest the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end where did eye for an eye go wrong i don t think i need to count all the ways for you but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic what was sally field s job i know that is a small detail but it better highlights my complaint that our central family the mccanns were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed ed harris literally walked through his character proving that field s husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion the only character worth watching and was developed briefly was kiefer he was evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end yet we didn t even know that much about him either which upset me schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably didn t even need to read the script and the story played it safe from the beginning but it wasn t what i wanted to see i expected film like this to come out during the s not in it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris sally field phillip baker hall keith david and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan nothing stood out in this film nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it and nothing made me feel excited about these actors this was a literal nothing film it lent nothing to the cinematic world except and i stress this a bit another peg in a very tired genre known as the revenge thriller after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements which made me think of a high school drama production it was amateur at best but she said that is why directors use sally because she is known for being overly dramatic this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly sally saw success with it once but as she continues it only creates bad cinema there were times during sally s bigger speeches that i found myself laughing i couldn t help myself but her focus on certain words and clich reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn t have to play the outlaying father any further in films he was completely wasted in this film was there any emotion with him i didn t see any then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes also did mantegna take a class on how to be a one dimensional clich urg his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one dimensional police officers again the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself field over dramatized the entire film thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel but alas ole safe schlesinger didn t take us down that darker path i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast yet we chose to stay on the lighted path that coupled with the poor acting just created a film that didn t catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world overall in case it wasn t obvious this wasn t a good movie at all in fact i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the revenge thrill fell into that same pattern the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure this film did not sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight while everyone else was forgettable the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil watch this film for kiefer but nothing else skip it grade out of 
stars for the series star for the defective dvd st let me say that i love love the jlu seasons and i was very excited when i found out that these episodes were coming to dvd to my great disappointment i found that disc the one with aquaman on the cover of the disc would not play in any of my dvd players including my computer dvd player i returned the item to amazon and amazon replaced it in a flash again disc would not play in my computer dvd player and it took several times of ejecting and reinserting the dvd into my standard dvd player to even start the disc i returned sadly the item again to amazon who said that they have been experiencing numerous problems with this dvd edition so sadly my wait continues buyer beware i can understand a problem with one disc from one order but to experience the same problem with the same disc from two different orders that to me spells defective disc for all anyone else out there have a problem with disc not playing 
i much preferred cruel intentions of course i saw cruel intentions first and it appealed to me more because of ryan reese no longer hollywood s golden couple if they can t last what hope is there for us mere mortals you always prefer the one you see first and for me it is definitely cruel intentions plus i have a tendancy to detest costume films and can never sit through them emma sense sensibility etc although there is a lot similar between dangerous liasions cruel intentions many of the lines stay practically the same and swoosie kurtz who plays madame de volange went on to play dr greenbaum in cruel intentions in both films valmont seduces her daughter there s just something magical missing i couldn t tell who was who in dangerous liasions and keanu reeves is infamously stiff in this loosen up man i just couldn t sit through it and i always know when i start films or even books i know i cannot sit through it unfortunately dangerous liasions is not for me although i m the only reviewer who seems to think this everyone else is raving about it but you have to be really into the film and be able to keep your eyes above chest height on the actresses 
elizabeth i dvd while viewing the dvd elizabeth i we noticed many imperfections requiring restarts and or interruptions of our viewing this is the first dvd that we have ever seen with imperfections it was very distracting while trying to view this excellent movie 
awful i thought this movie was absolutely awful it is one of the worst movie s i have seen in quite a while you keep waiting for the movie to get interesting but it never does i don t recommend this movie especially not to a guy he would be bored out of his mind by this one 
ever seen a made at home movie nows your chance now how do you start a review of this kind of movie was it a movie when all of a dozen towns people at the gate are waving farewell and sending the would be heros into battle against the wonderfully computer rendered dragons doesn t that just somehow seem sad we six heros will die so that the dragons won t eat the rest of you ! thats right all of oh im sorry didn t see you there all twelve of you i especially like how in this town of twelve heros there happens to be a traveling deadly martial arts guy a beautiful girl with a huge crossbow on wheels talk about envy and the robin hood guy except he s actually from outside the town so i m going to stop now before i cry yes it was that bad but as always watch it for the heck of it and try not to be upset about time lost in a vigilant attempt to make sense out of the dragon storm movie thing experience thing 
pointless remake new rule for hollywood if you can t do something new with it quit remaking older movies without gregory peck and lee remick this loses most of the power the original had other than mia farrow s stunning turn as the nanny this is one big waste of time to me i know others may like it and if you do that s cool i just can t recommend it 
a boring waste of time there are a bunch of these movies and if you get one the amazon program will state that customers who bought this movie also bought these others unfortunately they are all the same with very long sex scenes with exact matching simulated sex oral sex man doing her her doing him her sitting in his lap facing away never do any of these scenes have the missionary position basically the actors are never face to face is there a new union guideline forbidding to look one another in the face well anyhow they are all long boring so much so that the only way to stay awake is to fast forward them and finally if you want a plot forget it the total dialog in this movie and the others is about as much as this review so you can guess how long and drawn out the lousy sex is to fill a min movie if you are into silicone and wonder how much can be put into someone nothing natural or wholesome her 
good but about years too late i have been a long time radiohead fan and like many others have been waiting patiently for a live dvd so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly years old i couldn t help being disappointed when i watched this dvd the constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch in fact i only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust i know i would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime ive always that radiohead was modern progressive and totally innovative i appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey and it doesn t help that before every song thom mutters this is a new one 
fact is stranger than fiction i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public who hasn t read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i won t go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie 
the fruits of comte while living in rio i once asked my marine corps buddy paul y why he thought brazil never could get ahead he pondered for a moment then said brazil is the only country that respects sociologists i didn t fully appreciate what he meant until i saw bus a film loaded with the blatherings of sociologists and social workers explaining the root causes of why a glue sniffing cocaine snorting fugitive thief named sandro shot and killed an innocent girl on a rio bus in a botched holdup then i understood when you ve got a constitution that says no one under can be held criminally liable for anything article you come to realize that you re in the grips of a sociological experiment gone horribly horribly awry that you re living in a nightmare of supremely stupid paternalistic sixties utopianism in a society with prescriptions for social problems wholly unconnected to reality or actual human behavior watch this film and you ll see this ethos in its full twisted glory from a bogus examination of root causes to dimestore freudian psychology to neo marxist analysis ironically it s that last analysis that really has any traction poor kids got to eat too and if they steal to get food it s at least understandable cf prov when you steal to buy cocaine however then my compassion ends as does the compassion of most people who are grounded in reality and common sense in short look for a lot of handwringing about why a young man would go nuts and kill a hostage interspersed with victim relative and police testimonials that are interesting and sometimes informative the incompetence of the police in the situation is staggering they must have had chances for a perfect head shot and never took it what a disgrace for all concerned as for the fact that the cops who suffocated sandro beat the rap well that s why jury nullification was invented since we re on this same general subject may i share a true confession with you first some background i was an observer to the precursor to the candelaria massacre because i didn t have a car at the time twice a week i walked from ilha das cobras through praca pio x where the candelaria church is located to get to the well to get to a building located on av presidente roosevelt on july i happened to be walking through pio x in the afternoon and saw the commotion as the cops rounded up a bunch of kids while others taunted the cops and threw rocks at the patty wagon that of course was the genesis of the cops determination for payback later that night my confession before the massacre walking through pio x scared the hell out of me because of all the street kids one of whom i once saw stealing an old man s watch off his wrist walking through pio x after the massacre i never feared for my safety again infer from my confession what you will 
game the movie four strikes you are out out upon the brief trailers and dvd cover that gave me the visuals of this show i thought i would really enjoy it it was set years ago during the famous world series made infamous by a single error that ended up keeping the curse alive and putting into motion later in the series the mets led by such greats as lenny dykstra and daryl strawberry beating the red sox roger clemens wade boggs to name a few in that world series the error goes down as one of the most famous in all of sports that however is in the foreground much like the yankee s world series was led by reggie jackson s heroic and never ending home run hits in the movie son of sam serial killing spree of sam berkowitz in nyc in the sat first glance i thought there was going to be a series of dramatic events that lead up to a climatic conclusion all the way down to the end when bill buckner misses the easy grounder to first base what we end up getting is one of those movies that tries to execute a series of characters and events in their lives tie it all together and have some meaning come out of it the result is what i should have expected from a movie whose budget is a tenth of what some players make nowadays dull boring spinning wheels that get stuck continue to spin and lead nowhere there is nothing poignant profound or purposeful with the script of this movie and if there is i guess i was to wrapped up in watching the red sox let another one slip away first off we have a decent cast to say the least michael keaton robert downey jr and catherine o hara home alone fame are all actors who have shined in the past and though aren t so much of household names anymore can still carry their craft to the greatest of limits the problem is not them the problem is the script ! michael keaton is a man about to go through a divorce his daughter is busier turning the volume up on her walkman remember this is not and he s seeing a lot of things unravel before his eyes it doesn t seem to bother him much though as the character keaton plays nicky rogan is a famous playwright in the big apple who seems more interested visiting with multiple cab drivers in a day than anything else the camera is always showing the cabbies id cards on the dash to make sure we know that they are from the middle east strike one this little display doesn t seem to get anything across that has any purpose or direction with the film and seems not only unnecessary but also ultimately annoying after about the fourth cab ride rogan is about to have a personal drama performed and he s not sure how it s going to be perceived by the masses strike two despite all the things outside rogan saying he s supposed to be worried scared or bothered he doesn t really come across that way if anything this character acts more like a fake puppet than a man with any emotion feeling or personality he is supposed to be nervous because critic david schwimmer downey jr is going to be the major reviewer of his new play schwimmer himself received a bad review or something and is now some sort of syd barret see pink floyd founder drugsgone crazy supposedly left band becomes artistic recluse in his apartment and seems to spend most of his time just staring at walls and acting like he s had a lobotomy with a drill that has a low battery strike three this entire subplot never takes off and despite bringing this character into the foreground including a standoff with rogan in schwimmer s apartment with rogan s teen daughter half naked on the couch it just doesn t fly by this time in the movie i m saying i don t really care im going to give them one more chance at bat strike four ! at one point in the movie rogan is told he should carry a gun for safety okay i m thinking there will be some bernard goetz see bernard goetz weird engineer ny resident would be robbers on subway goetz shoots them becomes cult icon herocrazy dude for self defense and gun ownership type situation brewing the gun is fired off in schwimmer s apartment a few times but nobody gets hurt thankfully i mean i didn t really want anyone to get hurt after that ill call a ball one ! here schwimmer and rogan sit down and start talking because they realize they have something in common that is a stronger bond than most realize they both are boston natives and huge red sox fans rogan s mistress who happens to be funding his new play and rogan s father who is in ailing health and rogan visits now and again make guest appearances there are a few bright spots in the movie when things like the already mentioned red sox bond come into play but ultimately this thing is over by the fourth inning sure the fat lady isn t singing yet but like they said in the special features part of the dvd the world series wasn t technically over for the sox in that game as the loss forced it to game seven in which the mets ultimately won but it didn t matter every fan knew it was a done deal despite the hope in the end rogan skips his plays debut and ends up offering the cab driver that happens to have her grandson with her nope this time its actually someone not from the middle east to go to a bar and watch the game the actual footage of the game was fun to watch for this sports fan though i still feel bad for buckner and all the bosox fans when that ball went through his glove and the mets scored the winning run as a result special features in trying to be objective to my own criticism of this film i learned that there were basically two ideas world series playwright vs critic showdown that were eventually melded into one although its not a total loss considering the movie did surprisingly only cost half a million dollars to film its not a gain at all because the script in regard to the playwright vs critic storyline is way to loose it never really comes across strong and again with the exception of the bosox tie between the two men the journey to get there is filled with eccentric drivel and boring dialogue that don t hold up well at all i understand its an unconventional film but that does not excuse it from having a weak script and scenes that are made epic but ultimately deliver nothing of substance in the film in the end this sports fan was pleased with the different people involved with the film telling where they were and how they felt when buckner missed that ball it s to bad that kind of passion was not put into a stronger script that helped tie the themes and overall storyline together better oh yeah i gave it an extra strike and its still here sorry you are outta here ! game over ! see you on the field of dreams someday in rerun land 
should have been called star trek retconiverse i tried to give enterprise a chance i was excited to see how the federation and starfleet first developed and what happened soon after the discovery of warp drive but the show didn t deliver on those promises in the first season i could possibly have forgiven all glaring inconsistencies about the ship s naming and the technology the bland crew and the patch adams theme song if if the nx hadn t started off by meeting alien races that were not discovered until centuries later picard encountered the borg first nope archer ferengi archer and on and on and on that was not only flagrant unnecessary retconning it was totally against the alleged premise and promise of enterprise they missed so much opportunity to show how the charter federation members were discovered and eventually allied with a virtual warehouse of cultures to explore and flesh out and they pick ones from the tng era that have been done to death that was the last straw for me i understand they finally got around to doing this when the show was in its death throes but i wasn t around to enjoy it by then exploring the charter races i mean well the death throes too 
and the bolchevik propaganda continues this documentary is filled with bocheviks lies to reinforce the mantras against the imperial russia it was a religion war to destroy christianity and culture and to rob the russians this is still going on those thoughts are wrong wake up 
medicore at best i really felt like i had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not you people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie with how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up from a close friendship to a romantic relationship the guys don t even display a close friendship at the beginning how are they gonna jump from a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building to hot and heavy can t live without each other love its not believable and doesn t make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be the movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene and from there they are suddenly in love and everything in fact there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene i mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time or even was interested in guys in general but as i said before the movie doesn t display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene dont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren t really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are highly overrating it so if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy if you re looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship look somewhere else this is not the movie 
jason takes your money as a general rule any film with a large number of roman numerals behind it is going to suck and the eighth outing of the f franchise jason takes manhattan obeys this rule to a fanatical degree this movie is terrible an utter embarrassment and is noteworthy only as a study in corporate greed and marketing deception by the fourth installment of the series the ironically titled final chapter this formulaic slasher franchise was as exhausted as an old blood soaked boot jason voorhees had outlived his usefulness and it was time for his rotted a s to hang up the gaolie mask and retire but the movie industry is an industry first and when the final chapter turned unexpectedly into a cash cow the studio execs at paramount continued to flog their exhausted serial killer into progidies of meaningless violence the final chapter was followed by three more absolutely asinine sequels which saw jason improve the crystal lake gene pool by slaughtering legions of pot smoking teenage dimwits by this time p mount was beginning to get embarrassed by their deformed kill crazy stepchild yet the lure of an easy payday drew them on i still remember seeing the preview for this flick in a movie theater back in the audience ate it up we actually believed that the producers had decided to tweak the exhausted series by loosing jason in a place where he would probably feel right at home the big apple one could only imagine the bloody shennanigans crystal lake s least popular citizen could embark upon in new yawk city ! people were laughing out loud as they imagined him loose in the city of lights he could slay obnoxious volcanoites ! teach rude cab drivers the errors of their ways ! annihilate the snotty salespeople at tiffanys ! cut down on panhandlers ! convince grafitti artists to stay out of dark alleys ! run for mayor ! we sixteen year olds loved the idea there was just one problem the gang at paramount had no intention of delivering on their promise the ad campaign like the title of the movie was a fraud and the only thing that got taken in this film was the money of a lot of bloodthirsty teenage dupes first of all the first minutes of this odd minute movie are not set in manhattan but in crystal lake and then on a ship called the lazarus get it which is conveying the usual cargo of teenage acting skool dropout slasher fodder on a graduation cruise to new york jason accidentally revived from the depths of the lake by a jolt of electricity stows on board the ship and proceeds to ch chch ha haha his way through the doltish grads and the suspiciously small crew until the survivors are pursuaded to take a rowboat to manhattan island unfortunately manhattan island with the exception of a couple of second unit establishing shots is largely an unimaginative looking soundstage on the paramount lot populated by central casting new yawkers including the usual mixed race mugger team and an irish cop who says things like well ye seem loike foine peeple so i ll not be arresting ye there is not a single scary moment in the whole film and there are not even any particularly interesting kills kane hodder s plodding rotting thoroughly over rated jason looks almost bored as if he signed onto the cruise by accident and then got talked into doing his mass murder shtick by the ship s entertainment director to make up for the lack of any kind of suspense the writers threw in a lot of gratuitous pleading for mercy from the female characters and added nice little moments like a ship s crewmember talking warmly about his baby son right before jason runs a harpoon through his body classy stuff but really everything about the movie is stupid from the crazy deckhand who mumbles prophetically that the voyage is doomed shades of crazy ralph to the annoyingly cute little dog who has more acting talent than most of the victims hell the climax of the film features a chase through the new york sewers which we are told flood with radioactive toxic waste every midnight does rudy guilani know about this i realize having expectations for a jason movie is silly but even by the cellar low standards of the franchise this flick is a ripoff a fraud a dreadful fake utterly stupid appallingly bad useless terrible and horrible zero stars 
you get what you pay for terrible film dvd transfers and yes you get movies for about but look at the titles carefully if you feel you can enjoy at least of the movies then this set is worth it for me it was being able to watch horror express and bad taste for the st time in decades otherwise wow ! there s a lot of crappy movies in the box 
starship troopers its not pretty what a waste troopers is oktroopers is not do not buy troopers rent it what a muppet i am for buying this rubbish must look on amazon first before purchasing first the good points the digital effects are good im pleased shots actually splatter the bugs a big improvement on the first movie that bit the actors have flashes of talent i liked the hero tough guy the plot does kind of make sense perimeter guard tower all good butthe camera framing quality suck the gore fest sucks the production quality is just not there how to totally screw up a good franchise forget trying to ape the horror movies try something original and have clever solutions rather than arbitary deaths everywhere its tired its been done and its not good enough the film careered around genres trying to grab anything it could but taking the worst bits of those genres so very sad third rate horror third rate porn as for the second rate soft focus almost porn there is no actual porn before some sad case buys it for that i was almost expecting some seventies funk music dont waste actors talents like that its criminal it didnt quite plunge the depths but it came real close i cant believe i wasted my money on this slaps head repeatedly 
awful don t make the mistake and buy rent this movie based on all the star reviews this movie is lousy it is not funny but stupid do you enjoy movies where the actors talk at you as if you and they were face toface i don t the comedy is forced with some interludes that are unrelated to the movie and then they throw the aids theme in there but they treat aids as if it were a joke don t waste your money don t waste your time 
unwatchably dull i couldn t finish this movie it was so boring i guess if you are a sean bean fan you must like this film i m glad those other reviewers got something out of this 
just not gripping admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it s moments of entertainment but overall it s long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this didn t do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman s silent scientific discoveries completely amusing couldn t wait for the movie to end honestly 
it s o clock do you know why your children are cackling insanely reefer madness originally tell your children was created to teach parents that it s never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids through this film we learn that the soul destroying effects of marihuana mike nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter j far surpass those of cocaine or heroin we see firsthand that even teens who can quote shakespeare like nobody s business cannot escape its evils here are some of the symptoms of casual marihuana use laughing maniacally while running people down in the street playing the piano too fast having sexual relations with people you don t really like that much accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well having no recollection of being framed for murderif your child has experienced any of these symptoms he or she is a marihuana addict the solution is simple force them to watch reefer madness because if we don t heed its warning reefer madness will be coming to a theater near you or you or you 
gag me with a spoon i found this film to be a total waste of otherwise good talent it should be rated x i didn t know johnny could stoop so low it made me want to barf ! 
annoying mill creek logo the selection of movies in this collection is mediocre at best but that s more or less expected what isn t is the mill creek logo which pops up in color about every or minutes since the movies are all or nearly all in b w this is impossible to ignore and quite irritating if this sort of thing bugs you be warned 
stick with willy wonka i could barely get through the umerreimaginationof the childern s classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp s performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms off putting flat self absorbed and finally one note rather than the quirky fun of the original gene wilder version burton s film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton s part that doesn t make the final product any more watchable it s one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton s other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that s like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio 
the legend reworked to be fair the legends of herakles as they were originally written have little to do with this movie but maybe that s for the best having grown up on superman batman and the justice league i have a hard time calling a person like herakles a hero in the original legends he was a warrior but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage he also wasn t as far as i can tell as strong as in this version therefore interpretations of herakles are i think to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend but on where and why disney has attempted to take herakles or hercules in the roman and make it a story about a true hero and a perfect one at that there s nothing i like more than perfect heroes they inspire me conceptually i like the idea instead of herakles being the illegitimate son of zeus and a mortal woman he s conceived in love by zeus and hera and turned mortal by a potion not bad as changes go it works better than most herc meets meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him another deviation from the legend and a very good improvement of course because hera is his mother in this version she can t be herc s enemy so they make his opponent hades lord of the dead which could be worse as changes go i ve never seen hades as being all that bad of a guy but that s how it goes then there s the hydra which is if anything much larger and more powerful than it was originally so that s good too aside from this however i have to say i was disappointed with most of the changes the titans to start with were underplayed considerably it might have been premature to mention that they were zeus predecessors but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had and a roughly similar appearance oceanus for example lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose or cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence particularly since hercules didn t beat the titans alone in the original stories nor does it make sense that he should in this one grabbing a whirlwind come on now i actually didn t mind hades used carsalesman demeanor all that much though i didn t see a reason why he should have flame based powers when that s clearly apollo s territory further i thought most of the gods and muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature why is this the case i think disney made the mistake in this film of not just trying to make the legends clean but fun as well and there s nothing fun about war i m not saying they couldn t have made the concept work in fact i m saying they could have made it work if they d toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect justice league style still for what it s worth this is one of the few movies left in the world that isn t afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero and for that it s worth at least one viewing rent it from your local video store in my opinion before you make your decision 
a b movie that defines the b movie world please please please reconsider purchacing this movie new unless you absloutly must have it in your collection this thing is absloutly horrid and the only two redeeming things are the harryhausen animations and ms welch in that furry bikini of hers personally i find it amazing that cavewomen could keep their hair so clean and styled here but that s just me now as to the best time to view it best when under the influence of a pint of fine whiskey and in the company of good friends that want something to make fun of for a short period of time 
st star wars related thing i didn t realy care for this was really bad i had to force myself to finish the first feature film i now realize why this only lasted a short time there was really no point compared to the clone wars this was bantha poodoo 
sorry this movie is so freakin stupid yes its funny but so very dumb not good dumb bad dumb terribly painfully stupid funny at times best avoided or taken in small doses 
disappointing and forgettable i watched fast forward and i will not purchase the dvds fast forward left behind the complex well written and nicely animated tmnt series of with fast forward the tmnts are in a brightly colored flatly drawn world of trite dialogue spoken by two dimensional characters there is nothing distinctly tmnt about the show anymore splinter and the turtles could be replaced by any good guy characters with no impact on the series it is as if the turtles and splinter were plunked into a generic storyline instead of having an original storyline inspired by the characters themselves i ve been a fan of the tmnt for some time and i will continue to be a fan of the turtles i am not a fan of fast forward 
one of the worst moderately high budget movies ever i am not in the habit of giving bad reviews but this one deserves it watching the movie made me wonder if roger moore was going to actually say im only doing this for the money there are better action movies better thrillers and better political commentaries catch this some late night on an obscure cable channel save your money 
not so much fun for nerds if you were one of the nerds in high school this movie will doubtless raise not so fond memories revenge of the nerds has a few amusing moments aka the talent show but the genuine meanspiritness of the jocks in this movie inspired more than a full bullies while the movie purports to be on the side of the nerds the characters are so stereotypical that you can t really identify with them if you re looking for cheap laughs yeah i guess this movie is worth watching but if you are looking for a realistic portrayal of people labelled as nerds then look for the dvd of freaks and geeks 
just my cents i ve loved this film forever it s a yearly viewing at halloween for me my vhs was looking more and more worn out so a dvd announcement was met with much excitement however for everything that s already been mentioned here i didn t buy the dvd i ve seen shots of the image quality and it looks excellent enough to make my mouth water but all the bad comments about it still stop me from buying it now it s much cheaper in some places but even so i find it hard to waste money on something that has essentually been ruined by a wrong thinking studio closing read the comments here and realise that we will all buy this film heck even for the price this one was listed at if you will just restore it to its original print complete with all scenes and musical score this version isn t even worth bucks thanks in advance 
the world s full of lonely people patrick dempsey had an usual niche in the s teen comedy as did the characters he played he was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end here was no acception he plays the lovable loser once again this time he was an arrogant cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college disappointed and angry at his failing grades his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place while patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor he encounters a beautiful mysterious stranger who like the plot to a bad porn movie makes his job worth while with no strings attached while this fleeting encounter might have ended there the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this and soon patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy the smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that long before desperate housewives he was their afternoon delight what was amazing to me in watching this movie is that patrick didn t have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires he is simply a friend a companion someone to talk with i guess i just don t understand why some of the women he was servicing didn t try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head of course as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving that s an urban ledgend if there ever was one i gave this only stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words still it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people 
dubbed series if you are used to watching btb of the bbc series you will be extremely disappointed bob and his gang s voice have changed so is their favorite line to can we dig it there should be options for english american english others 
burr did not answer straight unfortunately i had already ordered these dvd s before i logged onto the bar method website on the site there are news clips posted from old interviews etc i read one interview where she was being interviewed at her studio and the reporter was being givin a lesson via a tv segment all about her method when asked if this was all burr did to keep in shape she replied pretty much sounded like a vague answer to me the interviewer asked again later in the segment so this is all you need to stay in shape once again she answered pretty much seems to me if you were excited to share your program and sell it you would say im in great shape and this is all i do ! i have tired it once and you definately feel it the next day so we will see yvonne 
great acting wasted on a poor script i ve dared to challenge my cinema going art student friends and uni mates amid heated discussions about david lynch akira kurosawa and such by confessing that i really didn t like magnolia at all i feel that pt anderson does indeed create well rounded characters compelling dialogue and stuff like that the actors cast in his movies always deliver brilliant performances but in the end i really felt magnolia fell short of something more substantial it dragged on way too long the extensive scenes never really seemed to go anywhere and i felt that some serious revisions and editing would have been most beneficial there were twists and diversions that didn t really add anything and overall i felt like it was a waste of time which is a shame because some of the scenes featured some great and inspiring acting but maybe they were misplaced it didn t really have the sort of message that i couldn t have gotten from a song or another movie in less time and all the symbollic arty stuff came across as pretentious film student stuff i think pt anderson is highly overrated as a director and his films are way too self indulgent i don t think he s very good at telling a story without going overboard and sending the viewer astray with the exception of the performances by julianne moore and tom cruise i thought this film was terrible 
visual diappointment for a great format like several others i agree that the cinemascope version was well presented but what a disappointment as far as the todd ao digital transfer ! the original release i bought in gives a much clearer and brighter todd ao version that gives you a much better idea of what the original may have looked like i enjoyed seeing the miracle of todd ao again but similarly the realism that was present in the original was lost either due to poor quality of stock or inabilty to be able to digitally correct and sharpen the image i find it hard to imagine that fox couldn t resore it better there was an apology printed on our region version 
my least favorite star trek movie first let me give the pluses this movie was a bridge between the star trek casts it also hit science fiction at its best with the nexus utopia shown to be pleasant but not the best malcolm mcdowell was a good villain though not at alex delarge a clockwork orange proportions the strength of each of the star trek incarnations is a great ensemble there is some heirarchy but you still have a team feeling this movie does not develop either the original or the next generation ensembles the focus is only on three characters captain kirk william shatner captain picard patrick stewart and guinan whoopi goldberg who took the mentor role in this story there are only short appearances from the original cast and only enough interaction of the next generation cast to show they re there there were other ways one could have bridged the gap that could have been better and more satisfying 
worthwhile as slasher flicks go this one wasn t that bad the only obvious negative is the killer creature it too closely resembled swamp thing and the outfit was too silly but the story was good and entertaining the acting was professional the sheriff was a characature how did all of the killer s victims disturb the land why was he killing everyone and why did he not kill the young lady at the end the actual murders were a bit overdone gore does not necessarily equal quality storytelling there is something missing to the plot the relationship between the blossoming teens did not develop enough before he became hamburger helper this movie was worth what i paid for it but not much more 
the worst movie ever after having seen many gene wilder movies as a child and recalling they generally were funny i acquired a few of them recently for my collection while see no evil hear no evil generally disappointed it certainly had its moments unfortunately the same cannot be said about this movie it was poorly acted slapstick pie throwing humour which anyone with more than years in school would find utterly depressing there were not even partly amusing scenes or jokes and the continued return to the movie director beating up his assistant while his management team sweet talked him was among the absolute low points it is not clear to me who the target audience was for this movie when it was created and an excuse could be if it was meant for year olds otherwise humour has certainly changed since these days if the scale made it possible to give negative number of stars this would have been a prime candidate dont see it even if someone offers you money to do so 
one of the worst adaptations ever made sure there are other movies that have butchered their source material beyond recognition but it s not even the butchering that s the problem the problem comes when the director hits all the marks and completely misses the point of the book jan de bont decided to take the atmospheric haunting of hill house and turn it into a carnival ride and give an easy explanation to the haunting depalma went and decided to tone down the racism in bonfire of the vanities but those weird decisions to miss the point pale in comparison to shlessinger s choice of turning a vicious novel into sentimental slop from the opening sequence with the tinkling piano music to the ending with faye sighing at tod s stupid rose this movie sets out to jerk tears and make the viewer feel bad even if there wasn t a great book to be killing this would be a terrible movie but with day of the locust as a source material the awfulness of this movie borders on the criminal one imagines the book done right by a quentin tarantino or a todd solondz where the book is fast the movie is slow tod hackett is supposed to be a fat cynical observer but shlessinger decided to cast an anonymous pretty boy in his role the casting choice is decidedly better with donald sutherland as homer simpson but sutherland is emoting way too much pain for the humor to come through every time you see him you want to kill yourself and his abuse at the hands of faye goes on forever the riot scene that ends the movie becomes a night of the living dead ripoff and the whole thing just drags on furthermore the key sequence of the book tod imitating the police sirens gets lost and tod just cries and gnashes his teeth or something this is a terrible movie the original book deserves much better 
a minus b movie this movie really didn t show me anything exciting in salsa dance the only exciting thing was seeing singers performers willie colon and celia cruz 
sucks unless you enjoy movies that are not funny not scary and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even sobaditsfunny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! 
fake and derivative this review will be simple garden state is fake manipulative and annoying it tries way too hard and every idiosyncratic element seems forced and insincere i hate to offened any reader out there but the entire time i was watching this flick i had one re occuring thought this is a movie for tools you know those big budget well shot tv commercials for cars or cellphones it s about two hours of that vapid and pretty micro managed and insincere the compulsive overstated attention to detail is obnoxious and trite the director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots well than making a decent movie skip this one cliched derivative phoney forced if you re in the mood for something in this genre just rewatch your wes anderson collection or maybe i heart huckabees or even eternal sunshine don t waste your time on this drivel 
trying trying is the best word to describe this movie it tried my patience the opening scene was several minutes of nothing and i had to hold myself back from turning the movie off i told myself give it a chance and i repeated that through the entire film somewhere with in minutes i just wanted to find out what was happening and why well i can t spoil the movie but it tried to be artistic in fact i think most of the people who review this movie with five stars want to be artsy examining composition and frames and dialog and colors and blah blah blah this movie was a waste of my time the only theme or concept i took away from the film was that upper class french people are annoying 
wow boy this movie was weird and psycho i happen to like the weird movies but it was way off the psycho side for me friends try to cover up an accidental death from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong things like this i try to stay away from although i am glad i saw it so i won t always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not now i know i gave it stars because the movie did have it s charms 
o please for me this movie is a painfull thing to watch i wish that i could give this stars the infamous fake o scene kind of recked true intamacy for me it may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable one of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with just fyi 
these movies have not withstood the test of time these dvds are poor quality some have dubbed in dialog some are kinescopes from the s and all are grades below a b rated movie the common denominator is the poor production by the original directors which no amount of nostalgia will forgive the tv plays are really the bottom of the bottom unlike i love lucy tv productions or full length movies from the s these have not withstood the test of time 
a big waste of time i loved the original movie and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be awesome wrong wrong wrong first of all the child actors were horrible well the charlie and mike characters were ok but the two girl actors were the worst i ve seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder 
angel season two slim set the problem with this dvd is that it does not play in nz so it is useless can i send it back 
appalling this is the worst remake i have ever seen hands down woefully miscast with none of the creepy atmosphere and classiness of the original this film belongs in the scrap heap 
hang me from my neck until i m dead if i ever a subject myself to this movie ever againorb subject anyone else including animals to this movieform a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review just one question that still haunts me how does travolta s career survive this debacle and pepper s hits the tank 
love lost in space always loved lost in space now i can watch it anytime i want t 
fantastic pq awful movie reference picture quality on hd dvd basically unwatchable though i would not recommend the blind buy on this one 
not that great i like buddy guy alot and have most of his cd s however this dvd is not that great i guess i was expecting it to be his concert from the cd by the same name which is great this dvd is shot at very close angles and almost in black and white the concert footage is done in a kind of a drab brown color this is a biography dvd also little interviews mixed in with the show anyone who has seen buddy knows how intense he can be in concert and thats part of his charm but this dvd leaves me flat there are other shows on ebay that are much better such as the north sea jazz festival show in if you want some real buddy guy thats the one 
terrible i used to like this film back in the late s but after purchasing it reading the book and watching it again i realized that there isn t much to say that is redeeming of this film sure it s low budget but the story and characters are so cheesy and not in a good b movie way i guess this film will still have it s fans but after reading the book i dont normally compare books to films because its downright impossible to compare i found the characters just not that likeable and the ending is very ridiculous for a film to achieve cult status isn t too hard if its a b movie but whether its a good film or not is the real question as for me i rate this low because i find it atrocious but for it s fans the ones out there that really love this film and call it a classic i must say i hope some day they remake the story with better actors effects and plotting 
hahahahahah this movie was extreamly stupid but very funny we just laughed though this hole movie this was pretty much very soft porn the hole time all the guys did was rub themselves or the priest rubbed them the special effects sucked they were probably better in the old bewitched episodes the black and white ones the acting was very bad and this movie is very anticrist 
erotica in the old west this is the saga of two women friends who find themselves sexually frustrated because their husbands are married to their work grace amy lindsay and her good friend jenifer kim yates and their spouses are on some kind of vacation together or maybe their husbands are attending a work related convention in any case they are staying at a hotel somewhere in the west and are bored silly realizing this grace s husband ray jim stevens arranges for her and jenifer to visit a restored old west ghost town at the ghost town grace and jenifer begin to explore their setting when their new settings eventually the come across an antique mirror in a storeroom of the saloon when grace tries to touch the mirror her hand penetrates it so of course being world class explorers they decide to go through the mirror on the other side of the mirror they are still in the saloon but it is now in the eighteen hundreds to make a long story short the madame of the saloon thinks grace and jenifer are two hostess prostitutes she had sent for and puts them to work in the meantime jenifer s husband appears as sheriff bart nicolas yff and grace s husband is now reverend issac much to the annoyance of his girl friend evie sheriff bart takes a shine to jenifer and she sets jenifer up for the murder of the sheriff s deputy after a very speedy kangaroo court jenifer is sentenced to hang in the morning in the meantime after a couple rolls with the customer s reverend issac is trying to save grace s soul while she is trying to seduce him grace wins but she has to save her friend from the hangman together they escape and retrace their steps though the magic mirror back into the twenty first century and their now attentive modern day husbands report cardstory d acting cdirecting d cinematography c cast c eroticism factor c entertainment factor dconclusiontimegate tales of the saddletramps is not quite awful but i certainly wouldn t have missed anything had i not seen it the plot story was contrived silly hokey and frankly not very well presented in the scene where the girls go back in time by going through an antique mirror the special effects were so poor that you could tell they were walking beside instead of through the mirror for a low budget softcore movie the cast acting and sets weren t too bad but the weakness of the screenplay and directing by sam silver trumped everything else the nudity was full but not explicit there were about eight sex scenes of varying intensity and creativity none of which came close to being exceptional none looked authentic though a couple with kim yates in my opinion did feel sensual kim has a very nice body and was the best performer in the film though not enough to raise my rating above stars 
good try but didn t do it for me i do respect what they are trying to do in this movie but it doesn t come to fruition in my opinion it is definitely true that you will have to watch it at least twice to get it all but i am not sure you will want to after the first viewing i didn t this is a movie that had great potential but in my opinion it never reached it you may disagree i don t mind depth and intricacy in a movie plot or even a little misdirection in order to keep it exciting eg sixth sense but i do mind confusion and it was not just confusing in the end despite a nice attempt and maybe a few moments of drama to me it was just plain boring alot of my boredom may just be attributable to the minimalist approach to this whole movie nevertheless it bored me it relied to heavily on the story and the acting neither of which were bad but not nearly good enough to make up for the lack of visual interest in this movie 
boot legged the movie plays fine but it is obvious that amazon sent me a bootlegged cd 
not even worth a rental unless your french and speak the language don t bother with ths drawn out boring movie many critics have praised this stale and boring excuse for a movie but don t take the rotton bait don t bite like a sucker fish it s a complete waste of time not even worth a rental 
negative negative the st season of the batman was ok but the second season ruled third season is mediocre so far i want the second season the only worthwhile episode on this disc is the big chill the other are lack luster the big chill had a lot of stale freeze jokes but was well presented a out of stars 
muffled vocals ruin an otherwise enjoyable concert the line up of s and s soulsters is interesting an eclectic mixture of the well known and the not so famous the backing orchestration and vocals are excellent however everything unravels when the lead vocals commence the singers all sound as if there was a curtain between them and the microphone when the recordings were made it is not just a matter of year old vocal chords being weaker than year old it is not the obvious lack of proper balance between the audience noise and the music the simple problem is that the vocals were not mixed at the correct volume i can understand such a problem with a concert this is a production ! i am perplexed 
cliched story inferior animation we re deep into the formula now with computer animated films and over the hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch can anyone say buzz and woody chicken run the exterminator is the stock villain in cgi movies almost identical to the vintage toy collector in toy story how many times can you do the a bomb joke worse still is the dialogue the painfully unfunny one liners and thesee saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions it is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another and that once again we see a cleverly disguised lack of locations or interest there must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest this film is a by thenumbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry 
fluff for bubbleheads another lopez vehicle in other words people who think jlo is the bomb will watch it no matter how many other fine movies are out there its too hard to find them just go see dumb jlo movie she s really good 
should not have had the same title as original when i heard that timecop had a sequl coming out i couldnt wait to see it then i found out it wasnt john claude vanne damme why bother making a sequl with no returning cast members especially the star vanne damme is replaced by jason scott lee jungle book as the hero who travels through time to prposly change things around here and there i saw reveiwa that this was a movie for sci fi geeks to enjoy i didnt see much on the sci fi side apart from time travel but it makes me wonder why they didnt just name it something else and make a seperate movie instead of calling it a second installment to a great movie 
like to waste your time then you ll love this one i saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him he was seeing it for a second time after the first ten minutes i wanted to leave if you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb american youth from small hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local wal mart or becoming mince meat in iraq then this movie is for you ! however if you like movies that actually challenge you to think don t waste your time with this one 
where did they go i came to learn of afi as many did unfortunately through sing the sorrow it was allrite but i never really got into them untill i heard their other albums after i got all hallows it was on i must say it was quite good now look at this ! compare the show to any of their older stageshows there are plenty of tapes lying around see anything you like now the terrible rating would not generally come to a band because of this music it s not terrible maybe two stars i guess but when you know what this band used to be and how they have suddenly shunned hardcore with no goodbye it s really just insulting and demands some retaliation i feel similarly about their latest album decemberunderground blech 
men vs woman again ! boring i would definitely say this is survivors worst season the problem lies in premise of men vs woman which had just been done in amazon and i was hoping would never be done again since it was boring the first time in vanuatu it was even worse since woman in my opinion seem to play survivor as a battle of the sexes anyways there is no reason to encourage it by starting the game that way add to that of the woman are lesbians who dont want any part of the men anyways and you have a recipe for boredom which is exactly what this season cooked up the exotic location seemed dull and boring with the exception of the eruption earthquake that was cool another problem is just in the players themselves most were annoying and all the likeable characters were soon eliminated the one shining star in my opinion was rory sp who started of annoying and then let lose and captured the game for several episodes unfortunately due to the position he was in he was doomed and was soon voted out sorry about the spoiler but you should not waste your time with this season anyways i did think this season had one of the better final challenges but once again i am disappointed by the lack of extras that could be included in any survivor dvd set i would like to see more interviews more cut scenes and tribe life oh well where is thailand and amazon 
an american discgrace in the discount video bin this film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave i originally saw it for free and afterwards i still felt screwed it stank so badly that i checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre yeah i know call me mister tact a horrorcomedy that s neither slightly funny nor remotely scary this film is a supposed sequel to the horror classic an american werewolf in london which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made the filmakers had a lot to live up to and boy they blew it in every department the effects were ludicrous the cast was lost the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues and the director should have been shot with something other than lots of narcotics this film is a textbook example of the hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew if you have already been suckered into buying this dvd i feel your pain you are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack 
a devoted murder she wrote fan but dvd quality is not good i came here to amazon recently intending to buy this dvd boxed set as i love murder she wrote and would like to be able to stop missing episodes when they are aired on television after reading all of the comments about the poor dvd quality i decided instead to check this second season out from my local library before purchasing it aaargh my all time favorite episode is keep the home fries burning and i couldn t even watch the entire show before the dvd froze up i tried wiping the disc off several times with a flannel cloth but that did no good whatsoever i also tried fast forwarding past the glitch but i couldn t then i tried selecting the scene after the problem place but the disc froze there too and i could not move from the scene selection page heres something strange ! my son belongs to a well known dvd bymail rental company and he ordered one of the msw discs for me as a surprise it came yesterday the company only allows you so many dvd discs out at a time depending on your rental plan well the disc they sent is one of six not three as in the box set and it is not a double sided dvd ! i m wondering if maybe universal made these one sided discs especially for this company everything else on the dvds looks the same only they are not two sidedthe disc my son rented for me was from the first season and it played beautifully i guess i ll just keep renting these discs from this company without purchasing the boxed sets i don t understand why the one sided discs aren t being sold in the boxed sets murder she wrote is a wonderful and delightful program and one i always enjoy watching i hope this dvd quality problem is fixed soon as i would still love to own these sets 
what a silly movie why the production team of this movie didn t film in new orleans is beyond my comprehension when i first saw this movie i could see based on the footage that it was filmed in canada the terrain is totally different from south louisiana it looked like a movie set i guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other it looked like a theme park ! the streets looked too clean for some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old new orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people s lives but maybe i am being too technical all the principle characters all had straight teeth and clear skin back in the s just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it the actor who played marcel could not act the actor who played his white father did not age at all for years still looked the same yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married years before the architecture of the plantation house was also wrong it was nt even frenchno live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern louisiana the supporting actors and actresses were quite good let me just say this white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in new orleans but also other states in the south the difference is is that in new orleans the white master would leave them property and money not so in other southern states the more beautiful the woman the more she would receive from the white man the placage system in new orleans was a business arrangement and it worked for both parties 
paycheck a forgettable future paycheck is a disappointing and sometimes frustrating film because it clumsily toys with a number of potentially brilliant ideas without really knowing what to do with them these key concepts come courtesy of philip k dick via his original short story though the film poorly represents the themes and conceits that have made his stories into unforgettable classics as a thriller paycheck depends upon our identification with its imperiled hero but the movie is never able to make us truly care about ben affleck s michael jennings or his fragile state of mind and that s something dick would have found unforgivable only uma thurman really earns her paycheck here the premise is high concept and the prophetic threat is revealed to be of apocalyptic proportion but paycheck is never more than a pedestrian action film spun from chains of meaningless chase sequences and flat fight scenes the future world created by john woo isn t nearly as engaging or convincing as say the captivating science fiction setting crafted by stephen spielberg for another high profile dick adaptation minority report for paycheck the comparison is not flattering sadly woo can t even keep himself from forcing his own creative preoccupations into the film and a resulting motorcycle chase sequence is outright uninspired and may represent the film s low some scenes are enjoyable and there are fleeting flashes of wit and excitement but much of what unfolds seems inappropriately conceived or placed paycheck isn t a smart film and what s more it sometimes assumes that its audience isn t even paying attention as a result the film never comes close to living up to its potential the material and the audience deserve better unfortunately paycheck is forgettable fare and truly it is without any real payoff brian a dixonrevelation magazin 
interesting premise based on celebrities secret fantasy but still needs more thrills and actions paparazzi produced by th century fox and mel gibson s icon productions looks exactly like any celebrity s secret fantasy but making someone s secret fantasy into a film is not a bad thing at all what i disliked about paparazzi is not the lack of wit or insight into the jobs of paparazzi oh that s so easy to guess but the lack of storytelling skill or its payoff as entertainment in other words the story about the rising hollywood star bo laramie who is badly treated by the paparazzi and his secret payback plans is neither thrilling nor intense as revenge fantasy yes i understand some paparazzi if not all deserve to suffer such a bitter fate as those persistent cameramen who stalk and harass the new hollywood action star bo laramie cole hauser and his family i know some cameramen really do annoying things and provoke celebrities on purpose in the same way as the mean and sleazy journalist rex harper tom sizemore does to bo and his son and suppose his beloved son and wife are hospitalized because of those paparazzi what should he do clumsy pace and underwhelming payoffs paparazzi is a revenge fantasy that is part based on the reality in hollywood and the tragic death of princess diana you just cannot discuss this kind of exploitation film from a moral perspective because these films are purely entertainment in which we see the good guys rewarded and bad guys punished and i like these films from the days of charles death wish bronson paparazzi however does not let us wallow in this guilty pleasure fantasy enough in other words the actions or bo s revenge are not thrilling enough and neither are the payoffs trashy or not any revenge story must have good amount of thrills in it in order to really taste sweet but the taste of paparazzi is only mild at best it does not give us enough taste of honey because several ruses bo uses to trap these paparazzi are too far fetched and even tame and those paparazzi are also too easy a target for him bo oversteps the mark because they overstepped it this questionable formula works only when it does not give enough time for us to think in spite of its short running time that barely exceeds minutes however paparazzi kills its potentially interesting story by its slow and clumsy pace heavy handed direction that does not know the right way to tell an intriguing story and disappointing acting from hauser and sizemore the only thing i find interesting is the cameos from mel gibson vince vaughn chris rock and matthew mcconaughey otherwise paparazzi lacks power and action that those revenge fantasy should have 
my own personal hell this is the first time i delved into the hellraiser series and i have to admit i kind of regret it the film opens with a collage of disturbing images i guess to get my attention but there is no real reason for them to be there from there the film falls into a freefall where it jumps from one messed up scene to the next it all looks perfectly twisted but who really cares clive barker as he did in night breed shows his taste for creative costumes and set designs of course they are all very self indulgent but beautiful nonetheless in their own little way had this film showed up at a modern art museum i would have labeled it pretentious but since it showed up in movie theaters i have no choice but to label it crap i would love to describe the plot to you but it didn t make a ton of sense to me kirsty ashley laurence is in a mental hospital and is convinced that her dad is calling out to her from inside hell and thus she must go save him meanwhile her evil step mom and speaking from experience they are all evil is reemerging from hell with the distinct disadvantage of not having any skin upon her return she uses her bloody pulp of a body to engage in a sexual act with another evil doer i m sure that gets laughs every time from the children who are watching but to me it was silly and unnecessary she goes on a quest for skin which goes off without a hitch and from there a battle ensues between kirsty and her step mom over the soul of a little girl named tiffany or so everybody calls her the whole point seems to be that our minds make up our own personal hells and that is an idea i can get on board with one overview shot of hell has it looking strikingly similar to an m c escher print with dead ends and trap doors and boogeymen we all travel through the labyrinth of our mind on a daily basis but i cannot get on board with this film it is sensational for the sake of sensationalism which is fine with me but not when it is mixed with a brain dead plot what do i or anybody for that matter get from watching a man carve himself up with a knife i guess that at least it is not soft like modern horror movies but this one does not earn its gore for those of you who demand nothing out of your movies other than the experience of a bad dream where nothing makes sense then this is your film for the rest of you this is failed storytelling of the highest degree i still have hellraiser on my shelf to watch and i must say it won t be hard for that one to top this mess i may never understand why people think atmosphere is enough to create a scary movie it is the major flaw of this film and japanese horror in general but i want a story to go with my scares what this one is selling is a chance to be grossed out of your mind or bored stiff or both i hated this movie and no i don t care how realistic it looked when the characters were peeling the skin off of their faces 
jesus what a steaming pile of crap julia roberts plays ed harris young new wife susan sarandon plays harris ex wife ex wife does not like new wife new wife does not like ex wife ex wifes cutsey but bratty kids make new wife s life a living hell ex wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo new wife thinks ex wife is a nagging battle axe new wife and ex wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum how does the film solve this conflict ex wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer everyone reconciles ex wife and new wife suddenly love each other the end this is one of the most cliched saccharine hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by hollywood in the past decade if you like julia roberts susan sarandon or ed harris please see erin brokovich dead man walking and the right stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe 
too loud when the background music completely overpowers the dialogue you may as well turn it off the background music was piercing and i needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm a shame because otherwise i could have enjoyed crash 
yawn too bad there is no such thing as a zero star this video is such a bored fest i was actually given this video for free by a friend of mine but after viewing this now i know why this was free i came to amazon to see just how much this pathetic video was and to my amazement almost dollars after viewing about minutes of this video i was already yawning i thought okay pretty soon i will learn some new fantastic technique or some sort of new secret but neither here is the basic plot of the video play with clitoris drink water play with the clitoris end of plot it is probably better to burn your money and to buy this god awful video another poor quality video by the welcomed consensus folks before you buy this video do the research on the internet about the videos and especially the company who is producing it you will be amazed what you find out about this company 
i m sorry i find this badly written spoilers yes this is a supernatural psycological thriller but far from a good one as far as i m concerned i love these kinds of stories and i went to see this film with a lot of excitement first because it has a interesting subject second because it has a great actor i thought denzel washington would never associate himself with a bad script but i was wrong but denzel is always top notch the rest isn tby now you already know the story a good detective a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch the hunt blah blah blah the script is idiot from page one the killer as we will see as the story develops travels by simple touch so excuse me why doesn t the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed i mean the guy is sooo powerful and mobile that i find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place but ok let s give the screenwriters a break somewhere in the middle of the film the demon enters a cat ok so he can enter all kinds of animals fine later on the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around his brilliant idea the forest full of animals was i the only one who did not know the ending before it came want more in an interesting twist the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on his own brother and no one will believe the truth ! how is he gonna get out of such a mess in the world of storytelling there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation either the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself so he should know ! and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything or something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil despite the fact that there was a way out first line of solution die hard the fugitive second line of solution sven chinatown we have none of that here instead we have an evil god against a simple man great starter for drama right but the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker and the demon gets stronger and stronger to the point where we get the fact that the demon is invincible long before he actually wins and the great turnaround never comes obviously we all hope he will be defeated and that s why i kept myself seated all through the film because if there was a way out it would be brilliant if the character dropped the towel it would be thought provoking to say the least but no the ending was easy and predictable the screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions he wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under the story ends bad label without any depth every villain has a weak point it is up to the hero to explore it may he loose or win the only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data we have the data the moment the demon enters a cat that s why we know how s gonna end what about the girl who helps denzel what about his nephew shouldn t they be part of the ending too don t come with the this is an open ending kind of talk do i sense a smell of desire for a sequel quick gas masks or as a cdoyle would write quick dr watson the needle ! despite a stupid screenplay denzel is always great 
totally unrealistic and annoying the main character came across as gay to me too this movie is in no way realistic the other reviewer is right about everything it s a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick the quotmartial arts quot in the movie are weak and sloppy there s no way that crap would actually work in real life i don t even know why i bothered to watch the whole thing i guess i just found the stupidity amusing the cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie unfortunately that s the only thing they put much effort into i rented it from block buster too they need to burn it this movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something like they had to make a movie to pass drama class 
not the full film the dvd is missing one of the best scenes from the video version of the same movie the scene where the woman is being walled up alive by vincent price i really wish the people who make dvd s would put the real and complete version of the film on the dvd and stop cutting out various scenes whatever their reasons may be still this classic old film has some good acting and a good story line it scared me to death when i was a kid and it still has a touch of the creepy crawlies now that i m a much older adult 
the ugly side of ugly lives hank chinaski can t hold a job can t hold a woman can t control his alcoholism and can t make a decent friend because he wallows with the dregs of society chinaski is the lowest of the semi functioning drunks barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor unfortunately the movie doesn t hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people chinaski s struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into there s no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism the closest he comes to poetics imho is where he tells his ex boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk factotum is saved only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn matt dillon hank lili taylor jan and marisa tormei laura into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene the script is stilted without any highs or lows to it the movie isn t near as fatalistic as leaving las vegas or as hard hitting as requiem for a dream and without any of the comedic relief from spun the closest comparison would be the jaw stretching yawn fest of drunkseven if you love addiction movies like i do or love dillon or tormei that still isn t enough to recommend this movie if curiosity overcomes you as it did me then rent the movie before buying it it s earned two stars for the acting alone have a ball or something else to play with if you rent this it s that boring 
stateside is an absolute mess it s a disjointed mish mash oh boy where to start first of all i was mistaken to believe this was a romantic comedy stateside is completely void of both romance and comedy it also seems to be missing a cohesive story and good direction the story follows a young marine jonathan tucker who can t help but fall in love with a mentally ill musician rachael leigh cook as he spends time with her her recovery begins to slow to the point where he is forced to sever contact will love conquer all believe me by this point you won t care i found the story hard to follow as the movie stumbled forward with a story this simple the audience really shouldn t have to question what is going on and why and how believable is love at first site in a mental institution oh hello sorry i squirt water on you from the broken water fountain will you marry me give me a break i was shocked to find that this isn t director reverge anselmo s first movie it has first time filmmaker written all over it the fault can t be put solely on the director though this is an absolute wreck of a script written by oh look reverge anselmo ok all the blame falls on him there is quite a fine conglomeration of talent gathered for this fiasco joe mantegna val kilmer ed begley jr penny marshall and carrie fisher all lend their faces to stateside all have small parts and try to lend credibility to the film ed begley jr did a good job with what he had val kilmer however was very inconsistent when he is yelling at the recruits he just seemed out of place he wasn t a believable or natural military leader however when he slowed down to talk to the boys from his heart he was quite good jonathan tucker does a good job as the lead and rachael leigh cook does a decent job as the mentally ill musician actress i just never bought into the relationship i really wish more time had been spent in the editing room prior to the films release the story is interesting but the way it unfolds is far too distracting to allow the audience to fall into a comfort zone and accept the story as told the movie also feels very heavy it really could have used a bit more humor to offset the dramatic tension caused by the marine s relationship with his father and by his forbidden romance with his famous mentally ill soul mate mastercriticco 
i can t buy into it amanda pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity but otherwise this film did nothing for me a bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests i can t even relate and they re trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness yeah right ! see it if you re a big fan of fart jokes or whatever 
not an alternative minutes i bought this expecting news stories on par with the books with the occasional interview as in the books its not it is a farce sensationalism over fact i don t recommend this for serious disinfo fans however i do agree with stealth kitten there are few interesting stories she highlights most of them 
the box set is only a gimmick save your money and buy the dvds individually please note i am giving a star rating to the overall seinfeld limited edition gift set seasons with original script salt pepper shakers and playing cards the episodes themselves are great star affairs i just wanted to give a heads up to prospective buyers that this box set is a bit of a letdown the salt and pepper shakers are miniatures that stand about three inches tall the so called original script is a cheap miniature photocopy of a script and is hardly legible and as for it being signed well think again it is not literally signed what you really get is a photocopy of larry david s signature on a small and useless photocopy of a script with photocopies of illegible scribings by david throughout the script if you want a signed script i d suggest looking elsewhere for one that is literally signed in person and has a certificate of authenticity and the playing cards are small and useless as well i know this box set is very attractive obviously that s why i bought it myself but it really is quite a disappointment once you open it up i recommend buying the dvds for seasons individually you will save about thirty bucks 
not worth watching all style and no substance even the dance number with john travolta uma thurman was lackluster and would cedric the entertainer please go away i ve never seen anything with him in it that was any good i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud i think christina milian s voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over 
hilarious ! oh its not a comedy there is so much wrong with this movie that i don t know where to begin so let s start with the obvious why is keanu reeves in this movie who thinks this robot can deliver any credibility in any movie winona ryder is equally horrid and her role is that much more vital her gasping doe eyed schtick is woefully inadequate to convey the power and allure of the woman vlad pledges unending blood lust in search of furthermore were there no brits that could play these two roles or were british accents really necessary at all if so why in the name of bumblebee man did they have to use these wankers who can t keep one going consistently gary oldman an actor whose work i usually enjoy is sadly over the top in a role that cries out for subtlety especially when you consider how much of a cliche this character has become his garbled accent and the hokey theatrics make me want to giggle more than stay engaged in fact my sixteen year old daughter and i cracked up so many times throughout this that you d have thought we were watching a comedy and that s not a compliment there is just so much to laugh at and mock on the plus side i thought coppola s back story of the romance and all was interesting but in the end who cares it is nearly impossible to immerse yourself in the story because reeves ryder oldham and hopkins are so wretched that you end up wishing it was a comedy it works better on that level if you want a good untraditional vampire movie go rent the hunger instead 
another nicolas roeg train wreck there must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason like it enough that this movie has been classified as a cult classic of sorts obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the criterion collection they have a cross selection of everything from the works of bergman antonioni fellini godard to the bottom pit of hell with michael bay s the rock and oh dear god armageddon ! the man who fell to earth is therefore prime criterion fare but is the film itself any good nicolas roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed this david bowie vehicle is no different with it s oh so s mileau i especially love how time changes throughout the film you see characters getting older except bowie who is an alien decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the s awesome really it goes without saying that this film is another of roeg s many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise capitalism consumerist spending etc that these ideas are packaged so blatantly the movie about alienation with an alien ! and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema if you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world there is no better director than michaelangelo antonioni with l avventura la notte and l eclisse for starters nicolas roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent the best part of this film is it s sense of humor it can be funny in a tacky empty sort of way plus we get lots of nudity and sex so that s fun supposedly directors by the s were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art house movies as possible because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition ! right ugh the dvd is high quality criterion collection work but the quality of the movie is your call i find it to be utter junk but worth a look you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of hours and minutes of your life nicolas roeg is a fraud we have to face up to it 
shame on showzen for an incredibly amazing hilarious show it is a shame that something that is normally closed captioned when aired on television is not really captioned when released to dvd amazon says it is closed captioned but there is nothing on the dvd box that indicates it is using this information i went ahead and purchased it anyway only to find out it was not at all who is really at fault i don t know and yes i am definately bitter 
meet john doe i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i m finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it s a little late to complain now 
embaressing while riot act is probably the bands most strongest album yet the tour that followed definitley was not onstage pearl jam don t even look like themselves anymore well at least on the tour the deliverence and shoegazing performance leave so much to be desired its only a worse follow on from the american tour where the band looked exhuasted and bored after what looked like a pretty impressive previous european tour of the same year probably the reason is that the band are t anymore and have become slack hopefully with rehearsals eating properly and new inspiration they will make their next tour back to their best and end this drudge which has made them look silly in recent times dont buy this their last decent tour was or europe so one day hopefully we will see a dvd from those times or prior to that new album soon 
all i can really say is no ferrara is obviously a required taste and this film does nothing to prove against that point not only is he a horrible actor but he s also one of the worst directors with an undeserved cult following his camerawork is atrocious and wreaks of a bad home movie the back of the dvd says that abel was trying to make a film in the vein of the texas chainsaw massacre but in the end wound up making a film more like that of taxi driver now even before i watched the film i knew this was an incredibly gross overstatement but now i think the dvd company that made such a horrid claim should be forced to remove that from the synopsis oh and the band in the movie was terrible hell everything about this movie was terrible ferrara is a failure 
terrible i saw the mlp movie and then i got this and was shocked the witches have the stupidest voices ever ! the original voices were so much better even i can do the voices from the real movie also the animation has too many glitches ! 
seasons are on dvd i didn t buy this pilot episode but wasn t this the first episode in season i ve been reading the reviews of certain items and wanted to let everyone know that you can buy the seasons on dvd at http wwwquantumdvdsmcombhillsdeschtm i can tell you it s not cheap but you get all seasons it s worth checking out if you re a true fan and if you re watching the season in re runs on fx 
it s a perfect example of today s horror movies which isn t a good thing if you ve seen any recent horror flicks within the past years taking lives wrong turn i still know what you did last summer scream then you know it s filled with the dummest imaginable good guys cheesy plot and almost un killable bad guys and scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end i almost fell asleep in a few of those movies that s how lame tiring and boring they are fortunately for this film it has jessica alba and seth green who are two fantastic actors actresses and are always delightful to see seth green is hilarious as the main characters buddy and jessica alba is more then sexy however the movie is beyond cheesy like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush but it can t escape the microwave or when the lady played by vivica a fox kill bill is hit by a car which is backing up and then is sent feet uh huh that s realistic ends sarcasm then there is tones of un necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head and how exactly did his buddies get back they don t explain anything and assume everything is magical it delivers the comedy pretty well thanks to seth green for that but is just too silly far too cheesy and extremely lame a hand that is possessed please give me a break 
read the book my first viewing of fahrenheit since its initial release in was last night via dvd any casual film fan who watches will fall to sleep very fast based on the novel by ray bradbury the clever idea of the future sets the stage for an interesting movie the vehicle that the unit drives is one of the most unusual devices science fiction will ever see the plot the sound and the characters are all completely uninteresting minus montag whom oskar werner plays very well the moment with the lady with the hidden library was probably one of the silliest examples of what books meant to some fahrenheit may be considered a classic to some but without a remake quick this is a boring artifact to science fiction theater in the future the government outlaws books and promotes people to do nothing but watch tv and take drugs miserable firefighter montag set for a promotion in the book burning unit takes up the suggestion from a fellow monorail passenger to read a book his life then goes upside down from there skip the movie and read the book instead 
but why is it called belly the american dream is an appealing myth no doubt the idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in america sounds great the problem as george carlin put it is that you have to be asleep to believe in it so instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs and that is where belly comes in an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it this urban drama stars dmx perpetually rapping nas and method man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies the story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs when the plot does poke its head up i picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from queens to omaha once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot one couple tries to escape to africa but find it easier said than done and tommy dmx is sent on a mission to kill a minister but really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn t even exist come on now i ve known drug dealers in my day and they didn t live in large gaudy mansions rap stars do rather they live in shacks or their parent s basement if my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is the directing by hype williams isn t that bad he is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks the lighting never seems quite right but i m gonna let that one slide as a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films i can hardly complain about their presence here there people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions all that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that i am going to give it as the most nihilistic person i know i am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used the n and f words are used to comedic proportions their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason and then on top of it all we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us sorry man but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn t make you any less slimy than those wall street hacks you re still a businessman this film is not worth watching any social point that is made is made accidentally and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta 
cynical dark comedy fall s way short of the mark i really like dark comedy i actually prefer it to regular comedy however one of the most important things that i look for is laughter a film can be very dark and make you laugh too and while this film could have been good the gratuitous violence takes precedence over a good plot and the film itself is lost in the lets see if we can shock everybody attitude of director peter berg what a shame too afterall the film had a very talented cast i have seen many dark comedies many that are violent yet they all had a common denominator violence for a reason not violence for the sake of violence this film felt more like watching a train wreck the longer you watched it the bigger the wreck got one many of the reviewers wrote that people just don t understand what dark comedy is i do ! and this isn t dark comedy however i understand that comedy is a personal thing what may appeal to me may not appeal to others some will enjoy this film and that s fine i know that i have my share of comedies that many would consider pretty bad and that is why i don t mark people with negative hit s i always felt that a review should enlighten a person and if it does the better for it therefore although i disagree with many of the reviews here on the merits of the film some have put forth some valid reasons why they enjoyed the film but the film was not that good to me i have the film in my collection it was given to me by a relative for a present a few years back i would not say go out and buy this film instead i recommend the film with extreme caution you must judge it for yourself one warning however it is not for children most dark comedies are not anyway so while i don t think this is a good film and definetly not a good dark comedy you must judge the film yourself rent it first you may or may not like it it just didn t appeal to me 
dust off your bong for this one sit down under a tree give it a big hug fire up you bong and go to sleep that s what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie it s a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci fi hippie flick i m surprised that freeman s suit wasn t tie dyed keep your money say no to drugs ! 
it s ok but the problem is they put in a lot of footage that is not of the third reich such as of japan england america etc etc it was sort of like they did not have enough real footage so they threw in a lot of off topic stuff as filler its ok but not truely what it pretends to be as for the on topic footage it has it was great 
nope i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a middle aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life so he takes a dance class ofcourse there s a fine dance instructor a crush is pursued a wife gets jealous hires a detective and gasp his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just wasn t for me not a bad movie just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance never had contestants who mastered it 
not impressed a big disappointment this dvd barely worked and didn t do any good this might be good if your potty training a boy it is very boy oriented they need to list it for boys and make a separate one for girls how can a girl relate to a story about a boy potty training they are not the same 
preachy but not in the way you d imagine i checked this out because i wanted to take a look at what the new doctor who people have been doing in the recent past the second coming isn t quite as cosmic but it certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy steve baxter christopher eccleston has an epiphany one night when he s out on the town with some mates he reckons he s become the son of god and he proceeds to turn night into day at maine road football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely chosen status a bit like david icke except with powers his immediate friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite becoming the new disciples some of them notably judith his girlfriend lesley sharp remain sceptical through the media he tells the world that they must come up with a third testament it later transpires that if they do not the end of the world will soon follow what are this messiah s credentials well he spends forty days in the wilderness which is saddleworth moor and he has no earthly father it turns out that his dad is infertile and couldn t have fathered him this tickled me did writer russell t davis pass his gcse in religious studies do we think i couldn t really work out whether the religious symbolism was unconsciously corny and na ve or whether it aimed at giving us a laugh i d like to think the latter steve curiously isn t what we might describe as spiritual certainly not religious he swears all the time boozes and although not quite loutish is somewhat laddish he s a laddish messiah his disciples swear at him and he insults them back message to southerners we in the north are not all like this despite the plethora of dramas which suggest otherwise preston front our friends in the north etc writers do seem to have this desire to patronise us thus whats noticeable about the founders of the major world religions is that they managed to espouse some degree of religious wisdom steve who just witters nonsensically to the crowds seems to lack this facility is he meant to be devoid of wisdom are we asking too much of russell t davis to place some in his mouth could he have done so had he wished presumably our writer would need to possess some himself ! jurys out it turns out that the party piece belongs to the sceptical girlfriend who clearly becomes the mouthpiece for the programme s message so what happens despite almost two hours of waiting for judgement day with little action or plot development we eventually come to learn that our messiah is something of a damp squib he ends up at the girlfriend s home where she feeds him a dish of spaghetti a la rat poison which he takes willingly but not before we discover that he is really just a sort of encapsulation or epitome of human religiosity enlightened humanity judith finally comes to realise that she can and must live without him and she spits him out they argue for a while before atheism wins out and steve chomps down the poisoned pasta after the two hours i found myself saying bon appetit so we get the sermon although it s a secular one which declares the futility of religious belief but this messiah seemed to me to be almost devoid of any meaningful religious ideas anyway you can t debunk what doesn t exist steve can t be a foil for atheism if he is a kind of atheism i suppose that we do end up questioning russell t davis s understanding of spirituality not to say he should necessarily adhere to religion or spirituality but perhaps to understand it to come degree and yes there is a naivety and a corniness which underpins all this third form philosophy typical of so many young people working within the arts its a pity that the message of the piece couldn t have been delivered within the actual context of the drama itself what we have is a two hour tv play followed by a secular sermon subtext puked out and all we do have an epilogue however where our new found heroine is hilariously transfigured at the supermarket i do recommend the second coming for amusement but for enlightenment you d better have something else to hand 
how many times are they going to make this doggy movie you know usually i am a big fan of older movies as they were typically made better and had better writing etc one strong exception that i just watched was king solomon s mines from what a doggy movie ! it makes even the lamest disney movie watchable basically it is hey look at that animal and then a cut to some stock footage except in one case where a giant rubber spider creature creeped along like a relative of the tingler star stewart granger also seemed to understand every african language dialect except when it was really important and there was also an emphasis on how much ammunition was left so the final bullets were used on certain natives to great effect once they got to the mine itself it was still snoresville and basically a letdown this was made before in and again in and in which seemingly the same results according to other reviews why do they keep making this same stupid movie 
misfire i was really expecting to enjoy this movie alas it starts out with what seems like a good premise but before you know it russel crowe is doing prat falls in an empty swimming pool ouch some of the plot is downright inexplicable the vintner is trying to convince crowe not to sell the land by conspiring to make him think that the wine they make there is terrible huh at one point crowe s love interest even acuses him of being another one of those people who thinks i live in provence because i have to oooookay do a lot of folks look down on people who are forced to live in provence is having people scoff at you for living in one of the most beautiful regions of france really a big issue for the locals throw in the obligatory uncouth american tourists some nonsense about lavender and scorpians and some silly fast motion driving in circles and what you end up with is a jaw dropping disapointment lets face it when a director stoops to fast motion footage of a car going in cirles it s time to raise the white flag i got the feeling that everyone just wanted to spend some time in provence and churned this baby out so that they could expense it all oh and the award for the most inappropriate and god awful sound track goes to 
creepy crawlers they nest tracheotomy with a pen ! can a movie go wrong with something like that the answer is yes for some reason they changed the title of the movie after it premired on the usa network it s really bad 
terrible i have never not been able to sit through a rated g movie however my sister and i rented this thinking it would be a funny show and it was so terribly boring that i was forced to leave the room i couldn t believe it because i love movies i can see how this movie would be funny for a year old boy to watch but don t count on the parents or older siblings being able to sit through it 
welles has lost it orson welles was a master of film but not this film while i appreciate the message he is trying to convey his cleverness is off the deep end this film is like a big ego trip for welles he s so proud of how clever he is but the film is a mess like paranoid disjointed ramblings in his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style clever is most clever when it is not obvious in this film he beats you over the head with the subtext and thinks he s cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled up the story line i m sorry i wasted my time to watch it i would have turned it off but given my high respect for welles i continued expecting a revelation or twist alas no it was just a stupid movie 
it was egh i gave it two stars because while i didn t hate it it was dull and predictable i see beter plots on tv s starsky and hutch it probably wouldn t have been so bad if i didn t have to use subtitles i found myself more interested in looking at the text than watching the movie i know that s only my opinion but i watch a lot of dvd s and i think i know what i like and don t like 
too kid friendly i think the only strong points of the phantom menace is darth maul and the lightsaber duals which i thought were well done and the visual effects and scenery but other than that the phantom menace was just an unfortunate mistake i think the problem is that lucas broke one of the unofficial science fiction filmmaking rules you vegottokeepchildrenoutofscience fiction stories or at least show them as little as possible how can we take a space dogfight scene seriously when you have a little kid who doesn t know how to pilot a fighter buzzing all around the battle and saying things like this is intense i never understood why they felt they had to go that far back into anakin s life anyway why not just begin the story with anakin in his twenties and already under the tutelage of obi wan that s when all the important events began and jar jar well we know the consensus on him well at least things got more serious again in attack of the clones and would continue to improve with revenge of the sith 
boycott this garbage ! edited music low grade picture and sound this is really irritating ! this show at least in the early years is as good as any show ever was ! the fact that the studio is too cheap to pay for the rights to the music is ridiculous ! to add insult to injury the picture and sound are bargain basement quality ! i think everyone who bought this or any other show that has been altered should return the shows for a full refund let the cheapskate studio eat the loss instead of making the fans digest this sh 
some amusing points first of all whats with this dvd including and what happened to the second movie the best part of is that apparently halfway through the movie changes who the bad guys are i think the original script was used and after about minutes the director realized there were only pages of script left so the last of the movie was written and the were badly stapled together i mean come on whats with the voiceover at th 
if this is great no wonder the french are exterminating themselves the total absence of normative values makes for tedium and revulsion not for greatness nor even for that matter for titillation when even father daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference it becomes easy to see why the french are exterminating themselves by refusing to reproduce themselves at the fertility rate of children per family the french nation will be gone in another few generations this movie will help the viewer see why sociologically and philosphically interesting in that it epitomizes the banality of evil and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig secularism is devoid of soul and offers nothing to live for nothing to live by 
please save your money this could possibly be the cheesiest movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of movies do not waste your money on this low budget low actingability low cameraexperience movie i enjoy a good gay movie every now and then and this was not it sorry to disappoint 
a rotten tomato in a golden box this is a relatively well made ballet dvd among others however the cheesy performance really is not worth such a luxury compared to the fascinating kirov version by tatyana terekhova and farouk ruzimatov this one is on the kindergarten level i d say i really don t know why lucette aldous was able to get a chance to play the leading role with her flat robot like performance what s more in the final act she seems to be totally exhausted with sore legs that couldn t stretch or even stand at all i think the only reason kultur video made this dvd so well is simply because it presents nureyev whose name is supposed to attract lots of ballet fans although i personally don t think his performance could compete with ruzimatov s in the kirov version my own suggestion is that don t pick this version if you are not a big nureyev fan 
what happened this ill conceived sequel to stan winston s impressive original while certainly not an altogether bad film will almost certainly disappoint those legions of devoted fans seeking more of the same director jeff burr has totally reinvented the creature s mythology and as a result has thrown a rather serious monkey wrench into what followers of the original film may expect we are no longer faced with a simple demon conjured up to exact revenge for those who have been wronged here the titular fiend arises harboring the soul of a boy who was viciously murdered for his extreme deformity while i do respect the idea that burr s heart may very well have been in the right place when he signed on for this project he still made one crucial error he approved a screenplay with characters that we as viewers never really connect with ami dolenz and all the other teenage actors phone in their performances reading their lines without any true conviction the entire production reeks in mediocrity and came across way too saccharine for my tastes there was no blood or suspense anywhere and half the time i felt as though i were watching a tv movie of the week andrew robinson does what he can with the role of town sheriff but even his contributions were sadly wasted and let s not forget george clinton bill s brother he shows up in a throw away role as the town mayor i really do wish in all honesty that i could have given this a better rating it s not all bad as i said but stan winston s original deserved so much better than this run ofthemill by thenumbers effort for shame mr burr for shame ! 
ryan gives standout portrayal in noir misfire robert ryan never delivered a bad performance his memorable portrayal of a tokyo crime boss is the best thing in house of bamboo director samuel fuller s flat attempt at japanese film noir ryan easily towers over robert stack s routine characterization which looks like a dry run for the untouchables apart from ryan and joseph macdonald s on location cinemascope photography this reworking of the superior street with no name collapses at the starting gate
