excruciating the zahir started out well but about pages into the book my interest level dropped it in no way mentally stimulated me i could not read one more page of the main character s self indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions i guess if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel then this is not your book i couldn t stand him and i really hope that the main character isn t a reflection paul coelho i almost threw this book away but i instead donated it i loved the alchemist 
christ loved the church first if the church is our example of marriage christ loved us first he did not need to be respected first i agree with the main idea of the book however the author puts more pressure on women than on men men lead the way in love as christ did even when he received no respect but crucifixion 
crichton phoned this one in if you ve ever seen the great movie thirteenth warrior that was based on this book eaters of the dead will just not measure up maybe the structure of the book was the problem crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual year old document maybe he was too successful with that conceit it was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension character development or an elevated literary style unfortunately those qualities are necessary in a novel this was mostly a bore don t bother 
disappointing it has nothing but pre published photos we have all seen before in magazines the tats aren t even shown they talk about how angelina has a lot of them but they don t even list them all not made for the true tattoo enthusist a coffee table book at best it describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats 
disappointed i was very disappointed with this book the author continually tells the reader to be kind and gentle with children and then recommends alternatives to spanking that are simply other types of punishments time out removal of privileges and the like she simply doesn t get it that children are human beings who behave as well as they are treated and who will behave well when treated with love and respect would the author respond well if her partner tried to control her in these ways there are many better choices see the book titles listed at the natural child project and la leche league websites 
lovely topic it s a shame it s so poorly written this is perhaps the most poorly written general history i have ever read assigned reading in a modern indian history course i cannot recommend strongly enough that instructors and students avoid this text the largest failing of this book is to poorly integrate the scope of the topic the book goes from focusing on one tiny event in india to another with absolutely no flowing overarching narrative to tie them together there is very little context given for most of the events described and the reader is left wondering why certain actors are behaving the way they are there also seems to be a strident anti british tone throughout the text which generally is a fair assessment for indian historians to make however the authors fail to capture the pro british vs anti british debate within the reform movement with any objectivity which is essential to understanding modern indian history overall a wonderful opportunity to introduce westerners to the rich history of india has been wasted and educational institutions everywhere should take note 
choose another book me and my boyfriend found this book to be slanted toward the jewish person who is having trouble with the mixed relationship i think this is a good book for a couple that will carry on a lot of jewish customs and forgo the christian ones 
enjoyable if you can accept weir s bias in advance reviewer alianore s opinion rather too indulgent of its subject is a very accurate portrayal of weir s work i will try to add something to that near perfect review note i listened to the unabridged audiobook of queen isabella hrs on cds the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable loaded with period details the last third is the worst weir s fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation nay elevation of queen isabella to the role of long suffering much wronged highly deserving and late redeemed just queen of england this book is really subjective rhetorical biographal dramatization i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis it is rhetoric because of the endless weasel words and expressions used copiously throughout some say it has been said many believe therefore we may assume it can be inferred this isn t just an attribute of her style it is her style comprehensively these expressions occur many hundreds of times commonly in conjunction with wier s subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons equally irksome is weir s double standard of historical psychological analysis she is always declaring for us the contents of isabella s thoughts remarkable gift she has for this many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful but then moments later she will portray isabella s actions from a st century point of view always telling the reader how isabella must have might have could have would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present day psychosocial interpretation of year old history this isn t historical writing it is historical op ed with an obvious agenda i don t loathe this work it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris rise of theodore roosevelt and theodore rex i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence yuck really if prefer more history when reading or listening to history and much much less editorial subjectivity retroactive psychology biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation the only way i could enjoy isabella by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly taking it with several pounds of salt as the above referenced reviewer advises 
super basic i m an ace certified personal trainer and was looking for some good information and new exercises to use with my client who is in their s this book took basic strength training exercises and had a picture of a senior doing the exercise nothing in this book was new to me if you are a physically active senior this book may be all right for you if you are a senior who has been sedentary or who is looking to improve upon daily activities of living this book may not be right for you 
really bad ending i liked this book up until the ending i expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable its what i thought was going to happen but at least satisfying and believable considering the power grisham gave the cia throughout this entire book instead the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
another bogus book from coren do dogs understand language do they have their own syntax and grammar stanley coren thinks so or maybe as with many of his other books he s only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people s interest and sell more copies the words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant since i train dogs in manhattan i often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs when the door closes i ll say what do we do on an elevator and they ll all sit this often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like look they understand every word you say ! not really i trained the dogs to do this by first saying what do we do on an elevator we sit once that pattern was established the dogs were able to make the leap from what do we do on an elevator to sit quite easily in fact i could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words gobbledygook ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all so it isn t my words or syntax the dogs are responding to it s my intent my body language my tone of voice all carrying emotional information and a previously established pattern of behavior stanley coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf yet still obeys him why because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior not because the dog understands his words coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing impaired understand sign language but looked at objectively it s far more likely that the dog s response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior not a linguistic or cognitive process coren would still disagree he claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together which he takes to mean that there s a kind of syntax or grammar at work i m sorry stan but real language doesn t operate on such a simplistic level and while it may seem brave and controversial of coren who has a degree in psychology not linguisics or animal behavior to disagree with noam chomsky about the nature of language at this stage in the development of linguistic science that s a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with sir isaac newton about gravity look it s fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips barks growls etc are sometimes used together and others aren t which isn t always true by the way it depends on the dog is that each vocalization comes from an emotional not a cognitive state in other words certain emotions like fear and aggression may be felt by the animal simultaneously while others calmness and fear can t be it s not grammar or syntax it s emotion pure and simple even if coren hadn t thought this through from an emotional point of view if he d spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he d know that a dog s brain has no broca s area which makes linguistic ability totally impossible but as with other books he s written his left hander syndrome was notorious for being based on false data coren doesn t seem to care much about the truth still i have to admit that it s hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we re constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues or to others through conversations letters etc as a result we re almost forced by the way our brains work to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog s feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists i trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever i ask him a certain question and i have to admit i like the way it feels when i say to him do you love me and he wags his tail comes over puts his paws on my chest and licks my nose does he understand the meaning of that sentence when i say it to him of course not but i know he understands the emotion its a shame that coren doesn t get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog a relationship that should be based on real and quite often wonderful emotions not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language if i could i d give this book no stars at all 
macintosh users beware i would have rated this book zero stars for mac users but i was forced to choose a number so i chose star this book is totally directed toward windows users if you are a mac user check your cd for a mac user guide 
too technical for the layman i should start this out by saying howard bloom is a genuis and i am a big fan but that is what makes this review harder for me to write everything that made the lucifer principle great makes global brain not so great the lucifer principle was entertaining and easy to read it was a rare book one that dealt with complex ideas but not in a way that was above the average joe this book read like a school textbook and one that you would read in grad school to boot another problem was that this book had no clear cut goals and those it did seemed to similiar to the lucifer principle stick with the lucifer principle and skip this 
mixed praise for an important work this book is composed of two stories the first called folded hands is nothing short of brilliant jack williamson created a rather bizarre almost tongue and cheek idea that works well in this quick blast that had me laughing and feeling chilled all at the same time williamson didn t take himself too seriously but the short story had some terrific ideas unfortunately i cannot say the same for the novella the second story for me anyway felt weighed down by far too much dramatic dialog and unrelenting techno babble that dragged the story down the humanoids idea that mankind must be protected from itself cant help but sound a bit silly in execution and in the second story williamson goes for the straight dramatic and it feels awkward granted there are some brilliant ideas but they don t play out because the author is too busy trying to explain this bizarre science that can defeat the humanoids that in itself sounds like a parady but he plays it straight ! when asimov wrote robot stories he understood when not to take himself too seriously on top of that i found it a bit hard not to feel sorry for the humanoids they really are passionate and just completely naive about what they are doing and its consequences i wish logic instead of mass destruction would have been formulated to deal with the issue oh well 
not her best i was waiting to get into ths book then i realized i was halfway thru it i always stick with berg you never know when you ll get hooked but this one did not have it i was relieved when it ended 
only for children i m not impressed with this book it was written quite a while ago it s not as true to life as most of heinlein s work this is just low brow work for him dont read it it s not worth your time 
the really own words of the master are excellent one at the front the really own words of the master are excellent one must make sure that only sides of the only x inch small book are interviews with bruce lee the rest consists of interviews with the former interviewers however as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune but the words of the master are absolutely worth while as already mentioned at the beginning 
scraps left behind this book is only a shadow of what bukowski can do i was very dissapointed with his wife being so hell bent on releasing his unpublished work these poems are all ones that he would have never released had he been alive they have no charm and show nothing of his talent his wife i guess thought they were good enough to be released i beg to differ if you want a good collection of his poems from the last years of his life check out betting on the muse which is an amazing book 
digressive is right the cover of the book calls it wildly digressive too true ! i want to read this book but i find myself becoming infuriated with the writing style in addition there are four people who quotspeakquot in the novel but they all sound alike they are incapable of saying anything without going off into multitudes of tangents full of literary illusions this takes more patience than i have 
social commentary from a marxist to appreciate this book you need have at least a general understand of the work of karl marx because the book is written from a marxist perspective from this perspective the author is able to draw certain conclusions about american society or a capitalist society in which a reader may mistakenly infer as to the intent of the actual participants of that society its one thing to describe a particular outcome as a result of advertising and it s another thing to say that this outcome is the actual intent of advertising companies and businesses a casual reader or biased reader may have trouble distinguishing between the two the book title is a little misleading saying captains of consciousness when the author does not focus on any specific advertising company or business the book cover is also a little misleading with a picture of the store front niketown with heavily armed police the book was written in no where in the book does it mention the nike company and book contents does not convey any sense of power struggle thingy going on overall it s an okay book for those who are familiar with the work of marx and sociology in general if you are not then you would have no understanding of where the author is coming from or really the conclusion he is making to sum i would say that is book is really just social commentary from a marxist here are some notes i ve taken from the book word for word that i feel are most meaningful to me modern advertising was concentrating upon a type of copy aiming to make the reader emotionally uneasy to bludgeon him with the fact that decent people don t live the way he doesmass industry requiring a corresponding mass individual cryptically named him civilized american and implicated his national heritage in the marketplace by defining himself and his desires in terms of the good of capitalist production the worker would implicitly accept the foundations of modern industrial live by transforming the notion of class into mass business hoped to create an individual who could locate his needs and frustrations in terms of the consumption of goods rather than the quality and content of his life workin an attempt to massify men s consumption in step with the requirements of the productive machinery advertising increasingly offered mass produced solutions to instinctive strivings as well as to the ills of mass society itself if it was industrial capitalism around which crowded cities were being built and which had spawned much of the danger to health the frustration the loneliness and the insecurity of modern industrial life the advertising of the period denied complicity rather the logic of contemporaneous advertising read one can free oneself from the ills of modern life by embroiling oneself in the maintenance of that life a ad for pompeian facial product argued that unless you are one woman in a thousand you must use powder and rouge modern living has robbed women of much of their natural color taken away the conditions that once gave natural roses in the cheeksthe advertising which attempted to create the dependable mass of consumers required by modern industry often did so by playing upon the fears and frustrations evoked by mass society offering mass produced visions of individualism by which people could extricate themselves from the mass mass pseudo demassificationappealing to dissatisfaction and insecurities around the job certain advertisements not only offered their products as a kind of job insurance but intimate that through the use of their products one might become a business success the capitalist notion of individual selffulfillmentmuch of american industrial development punctuated by attempts to channel thought and behavior into patterns which fitted the prescribed dimensions of industrial lifeif you are advertising any product never see the factory in which it was made don t watch the people at work because when you know the truth about anything the real inner truth it is very hard to write the surface fluff which sells it speaking of seeming purposelessness of american industrial life itself this lack of purpose in life has an effect on consumption similar to that of having a narrow life interest that is in concentrating human attention on the more superficial things that comprise much of fashionable consumption the mass produced goods of the marketplace were conceived of as providing and ideology of change neutralized to the extent that it would be unable to effect significant alteration in the relationship between individuals and the corporate structure fatigue with the futility of modern life might if all other avenues of change are eradicated be channeled toward a fatigue with apparel and goods used in one s immediate surroundings the concept of consumption as an alternative to other modes of change proliferates within business literature of the twenties given the recent history of anticaptialist sentiments and actions among the working class the unpleasant possibility of deeper changes gave flight to a more pacified notion of social welfare that emanated from comsumerization recognizing the irreversibility of frustration among those who felt trapped in their surroundings change would be the most beneficent medicine in the world to most people mass consumption is offered as a means of acting out such impulses within a socially controllable context to those who cannot change their whole lives or occupations even a new line in a dress is often a relief the woman who is tired of her husband or her home or a job feels some lifting of the weight of life from seeing a straight line change into a bouffant or a gray pass into beige the basic issues of industrial capitalism were fractionalized isolated and reduced to trivialities in her formula most people do not have the courage or the understanding to make deeper changes the logic of using consumption and mass leisure as ameliorations for boredom and social entrapment was not merely an underlying trend in advertisingfear in itself is paralyzing it robs one of the power of action no one buys anything through fear but rather through the instinct of self preservation or some other reaction that is almost inseparable from fearagain if you don t understand what the hell the author is taking about then i don t recommend this book to you 
booked to die painted by numbers john dunning s booked to die was a new york times best seller and also won the prestigious nero wolfe award it is one in his series of denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective cliff janeway dunning who lives in denver colorado owned the old algonquin bookstore in denver for many years and booked to die duh is set in the world of rare and collectible books i really found it an interesting world to enter and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done but do i believe the designated villain a book dealer really would have killed not on your life and do i believe anyone would kill over some valuable books not on your life of course i realize that in the current world it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn t feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places still one of the first requirements of a mystery for me at least is at least temporary believability dunning writes well he does well by denver and as previously noted the book trade he s a thorough going professional and the story keeps trucking along rented u haul and all as i drove south into the coming snowstorm i thought about the u haul truck and the mileage that bobby westfall had racked up i thought about greenwald and the screwed up ballards and the turtle faced man snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield the road was getting slick still the book has a paint by numbers feel to me or rather it has no feeling to me supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard i d say the book didn t touch my emotions but that wouldn t be entirely true it left me with a bad feeling consider the first love interest deserts janeway without a word when he leaves the police force a woman who s met up with the book s actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy suspicion is cast on the book s later love interest a ploy that s been used untold times by writers better than dunning and a year old female character introduced only to be killed shortly is made a glaswegian scot no less and stuck with the given name of elspeth pride known as pinky by her friends for heaven s sake if you re giving a character only pages to live at least give her a humane name my yiddische grandmother whom i loved used to say of someone she disliked he should live and be well after that came an unpoken sentence but not in my vicinity dunning should write and be well but not in my vicinity 
dull occasionally even silly poorly edited what a disappointment i was looking forward to anne perry s new series hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories driven by good writing and informed by history and period details but the most charitable thing i can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series it certainly doesn t stand alone as a novel despite its page length it s populated with paper thin characters some of whom appear only once and to no purpose carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations or internal monologues that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot which has no payoff this book felt like perry has become so enamored of her own prose style which is as ever exemplary that she s forgotten to give us people and a mystery or at least a story to care about 
too simple too personal this book is for people who never read poetry or just don t get it when they do the author focuses on why he fell in love with each poem information that i found boring because of the way it was delivered he then picks apart the poems sometimes cutting out every line sometimes grabbing at random bits it takes away from the magic of a poem when someone uses pages upon pages trying to explain why it is beautiful or moving those things must be felt gained from the poem itself there are so many ways in which this book could have been written that would have made it uplifting touching or at the very least not boring 
too much story telling this book was recommended for me to read by my husband s personal therapist he s in anger counseling after coming back from iraq and i m the one reading about six books right now while it was worth the read i need more more instruction more direction more getting to the point ! lerner goes on and on and i found myself bored with the stories i m reading for answers there are so many stories and you really have to hunt for clues as to what to do in your own life if you re reading a self help book then obviously you just may need some help now and fishing for what to do isn t productive i just didn t like the flowy story telling way of writing to me she spent a lot of time writing the history of a problematic relationship and then what the patient wanted to achieve and then not so much as to what was needed to fix the problem for a positive outcome too many times i read the phrase well get to that later 
wouldn t read it again i felt like i was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move i can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence but did there have to be such graphic detail i only finished it because i wanted to know who the psycho was all violence put aside it was a decent suspense story but didn t include any romance whatsoever casual sex does not equal romance in my book reader discretion advised rape murder lots of casual sex adult scenes and overall violence not on my bookshelf anymore 
mysecret i was sorely dissapointed when i bought this book it was so short and the secrets were silly there was nothing heartfelt about this book the first one was way better 
not so great if you re looking for accuracy as a person who spent over years in ghana and became pretty familiar with adinkra symbols i was disappointed with this stamp kit i was excited when i saw this kit online but should have read the reviews before ordering as i see several other people felt let down too i can hardly believe that the author left out the most well loved adinkra symbol of all gye nyame a symbol about the power of god i really wish the author had put more effort into her research and included the names and accurate meanings of the symbols in the twi language bummer 
kessinger publishing s version is horrible print wise this review is about this publishers edition not about the books content itself if you want to know about the content be aware that this book is copyright free and in the public domain and you can actually read the entire text free online if you are curious about the content of the book and what it is about i am a person who prefers a real bound book in the hand to reading on the computer screen or printing off a book onto computer paper i learned about this book as it is popular with homeschoolers using the charlotte mason method this book weaves science content into a story format narrative format about this edition of the book buyer beware i am very annoyed i saw that amazon sells three different publishers versions of reprints of this very old book before i purchased the book from amazon of course i am mad at myself for making a mistake but i am also not happy with the way amazon markets this kessinger publishing s version of this book i have had issues in the past with facsimile reprints of antique books sometimes being very hard to read i took time to research this i wanted whichever publisher s version has a readable font that is clearly printed the way amazon presently has this item book reprinted by kessinger publishing set up on their webpage i thought i was looking inside this book imagine my surprise when the book arrived and the printing itself is horrible ! i can t stand to read this ! upon double checking this now i see i made a simple mistake if you don t want to make the same mistake that i made please read on it appears that this kessinger publishing version is a facsimile reproduction of the original the old font type is hard to read but the more problematic thing is that the ink is blobby and uneven specifically i mean that some parts of the letters are missing there is white space while others are blobbed so that the letters don t look as they should they are black blobs in some parts i would prefer a book whose text is clearly visible a modern font is also usually easier on the eyes i am very annoyed as this is not even the cheapest price edition of this book which is currently in print ! come to find out there are cheaper versions with nicer and easier to read font i am upset with amazon additionally as the way they have this set up to look inside this book brings you to the edition published by the publisher yesterdays classics which has what looks to be a great font a nice clear modern font and a good printing job also today i received a different book purchased from amazon by the publisher yesterdays classics and it is a wonderful printing job and a a nice binding to boot i will be returning this book to amazon too bad i have to pay the shipping to return it to them ! 
rip off this book is a joke for a beginner looking for a comprehensive guide for investing don t buy this book unless you want a lesson in being ripped off this book is the size of a coaster the kind you find next to the checkout at the pharmacy about how to get various stains out of your argyle socks it s made up to look cute a two inch hardcover tomb complete with dustjacket misspellings and grammatical errors abound in this nugget aspects of investing are listed but not explained to any extent that might help someone actually pick stocks a fool and his money are soon parted by peter lynch buy another one of his books a big kid book but not this one 
boring don t get me wrong i do enjoy card s writing especially his uh enderverse i loved ender s game i absolutely adored speaker for the dead i m reading xenocide and i love what i ve read and i liked ender s shadow i don t like shadow of the hegemon though its nothing but boring long and tedious talk about politics also card doesn t seem to understand how much the world would have changed in years i don t know i seem to like card better when he s writing about philosophy not politics 
bones i bought this book expecting to share some fascinating stories and experiences instead each chapter began a buildup and then suddenly you were left standing there alone wondering what happened where did the story go very aggravating then oh yes this is by the way where we were toodle oo on the next tale or a portion of it anyway 
confusing ! i m sorry but i definately did not like this book this book was extremely incomprehensable it was boring and it kept bringing new characters in without introducing them or anything im not a stupid person and i m not to young to read this quothardquot book but it simply was a bad book ! 
christmas pleasures i am very pleased with this purchase the photos are so wonderful and makes one feel so relaxed and into the christmas spirit have already tried a couple of the recipes and the family thoroughly enjoyed them thanks to southern living for another wonderful christmas book 
a negative view i ve read it i wish i hadn tthe illos are nice but the backstory makes no sense at all and the writing goes downhill the further you get into the book by the time you reach kong s origins you no longer care go see the movie either the original or the new one heck see the version even that s better than this 
awful despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the th century byatt in all her annoyingly feminist glory has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet each and every character is lacking in charisma humour and in fact any other attractive facet about their personality offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy thus leaving no hero so necessary to such a story then there s the sub plot literature which was all unfortunately written by the woman herself to interlink the text with poetry and letters is admittedly a good idea but the quality is dire could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most and chapter just too long so unneccessary this is without a doubt the single worst book i have ever had the misfortune to read and would recommend it to no body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea 
bad editing alot of errors this books is fraught with errors that will drive you crazy if you re trying to learn flash for the first time it s a great example of what happens when a book needs to get to press before it s been thoroughly edited i m actually on amazon com to get another flash tutorial book to replace this monument to bad editing in a word don t waste your money 
unlimited power is so much better i read this book several years ago just recently i read anthony robbin s unlimited power if you re choosing between awaken the giant within and unlimited power definitely go with unlimited power don t bother with this book 
worthless rhetoric this book is summarized in a single sentence be a good teacher all the supporting comments should only take up a paragraph not a book and even then every thing in the book is self evident and not really needed to be written down the only people that should be interested in this are those in administration for some obscure reason they seem to like rhetoric then again they are also usually diametrically opposed to the best interests of students and teachers 
a mermaid reference book for the easily pleased love research on folklore and compilations of myth or legend but this struck me as the ultralite version this book is not outstanding or special in any way suggest readers whether child or adult get this from the library before they decide to spend any money for their own copy glad i did there are plenty of other mermaid books that contain stunning art and text 
a bit slanted i have to say that of all the books i ve read on the romanovs this one just plain made me angry because it s not very impartial i was under the impression that a historian would want to be as impartial objective as possible in order to demonstrate the truth in this case the author cakes the text with so much subjectivity i couldn t even finish it i m as open as the next person when it comes to putting forth new ideas but the book doesn t even do that for anyone who s read anything about the dynasty the author seems to have deliberately forgotten about anything else that s been written about it including historical files and information already well known in history his opinion is so prominent that it became more annoying the more i read i got the distinct impression he was actually siding w particular family members rather than looking from the outside in not a good read for people who love the rich history of the romanovs 
save your money this book is nothing but a sales pitch for their newsletter and most of the info is both sales and found freely on the internet very disappointed 
words you don t want to see in your copy i bought words that sell and the companion book phrases that sell based on a recommendation from a new letter published by d h communications both of these books were a major disappointment these words may work on the dumbed down consumer market lemmings with an affinity for the pacific coast but they are not effective for technical marketing literature aimed at an educated clientele i would change the titles to if you find any of these phrases or word in your copy rewrite it i stop listening and dismiss the possibility of truth or relevancy of the message when these words are present 
hawkes harbor a terrible book what happened something about an orphan boy meeting vampires and zombies what s that supposed to mean the second half of the book is terrible a third person omniscient view hinton needs to be a better writer to make it entertaining overall this book was an absolute choke i regret having wasted five days of my life reading this book 
worth every second every page i m not going to waste your time with a book review that s as long as the book itself so i m going to get straight to the point and say i absolutely loved this book though i love stories movies of this genre i d never read a tom clancy novel before reading executive orders that s about to change a large portion of this book is about how jack ryan learns to become president which by its nature makes this a very political story however it was written so that readers not up tospeed on political know how and jargon like myself could easily understand and follow along basically you learn about the presidency and its twists and turns just as president ryan learns and i think that s what makes this book unbelievably easy to read despite its plus pages in short this was one hell of a story that i couldn t put down i even learned a thing or two totally worth the price of admission five stars 
suspends your disbelief caveat i wasn t exactly expecting to finish pe a die hard believer that said i was unprepared for how much of my skepticism stemmed from the authors willingness to believe anything and mask their suspension of disbelief as objectivity according to legend the us navy conducted invisibility experiments on one of their ships during wwii not simply invisible the ship actually teleported from its berth in philadelphia however the little understood process played havoc with the crew even after the experiment s end some crewmen would blink in and out of existence become frozen in time or catch fire one man walked through a wall never to be seen again of course the navy denies the whole thing while the legend places the story during the dark days of wwii the legend itself began in the mid s with the publication of the case for the ufo by morris jessup aknowledging that jessup is no scientist berlitz moore nevertheless refer to him as dr jessup believing that propulsion of ufo s and perhaps future human spacecraft lay in solving einstein s unified field theory jessup encouraged readers to press for research in that area jessup s book caught the attention of carl allen aka carlos allende who spent the war in the merchant marine in a series of rambling letters allen insisted that einstein had solved uft and the solution was successfully used to cloak a usn warship in wartime experiments though claiming to have witnessed the event from deck of a nearby freighter allen goes further than detailing his observation exhaustively describing the travails of the crew einstein s seeming retraction of uft his admission to bertrand russel that uft was complete but had to be suppressed at least until after wwiii the identity of one of the chief scientists attached to the project and that uft had anything to do with the experiment to get his point across allen allende even forwarded a copy of jessup s book heavily annotated with his own theories many having nothing to do with the philadelphia experiment to the office of naval research there it piqued the personal interest of at least officers and slowly became the story thatwouldntdie a few years later a depressed jessup was found dead in his car allende allen became something of a cult celeb sometimes retracting what he had previously claimed often warning against the ominous dangers of uft even as he seemed to beg others to look into it berlitz and moore piece allen allende together with what are supposed to be other pieces of a puzzle that will prove the philadelphia experiment actually occurred instead the result is far less than the sum of its parts berlitz and moore place far more weight on any of the individual pieces than common sense would allow and they find a better fit between the different pieces than you d get in a jigsaw puzzle nothing in pe lacks a more reasonable explanation than the authors can provide at the beginning and towards the end of the book the authors mention coming in contact with others who claim to have met alleged crewmembers of the ship involved in the experiment but neither name nor any other convincing corroborating information comes out allende at least included his merchant marine id in his letters the authors add to the puzzle but never actually establish that the philadelphia experiment actually occurred an anonymous radar scientist who doesn t claim to have worked on the project clairifies how events would have had to occurr if the legend were true another scientist given a psuedonym because it would upset the status quo describes wartime discussions on a project that we re supposed to believe developed into the philadelphia experiment named rinehart after a similar character in the novel thin air a thriller inspired by the legend the doctor describes discussions but never mentions witnessing the experiment nor any discussions of its aftermath obvious details for such a pivotal figure rinehart never even mentions allende even though it had been allende s letters that clued the authors into rinehart s existence under yet another pseudonym the authors never explain how they managed to find rinehart they need to protect his identity even though the government obviously knows who he is and anybody else would have the same difficulty tracking him down as the authors of this book the authors describe how the experiments of another scientist in electrogravity never caught on despite their apparent success suggesting they were suppressed though allende described reading stories about the experiment s sailors in philadelphia newspapers the only article that could be found is obviously bogus a xerox of an obviously fabricated article describing a bar room brawl by sailors who mysteriously vanish but no mention of date newspaper or the reporter norany specific facts in the article about the event like the name of the bar or those of witnesses the authors make the barest efforts to answer the questions they raise and then merely add more pieces to the puzzle without explaining how one piece corroborates any others though appearing critical and objective it s impossible to believe that the authors haven t already settled on the idea that the experiment actually occurred they explicitly question allende yet never express their doubts let alone attempt to deal with our own but what s the danger of that i mean who cares if they can get their readers to believe the legend of the philadelphia experiment unfortunately philadelphia feeds on our prejudices of secret conspiracies and relies on our willingness to do so with little prompting never a positive thing worse it s not even interesting barely substantive enough to raise the sort of questions that would make a more critical investigation a stirring story 
a bit disappointing i found rick hess s humor to be a bit hostile and sexist in places such as on page when he implies men would rather kill themselves than let their wives manage their homes it distracted from what is a serious subject the probability chapter struck me as being quite irrational mr hess s states that there is no such thing as probability that we are denying god s sovereignty when we believe that parents with blue eyes are very likely to have blue eyed children what i think mr hess is denying is the clear evidence that god usually acts within the physical laws he creates yes he can override genetics and give a child any color of eyes he wishes but under ordinary circumstances we can safely count on god to follow the laws of genetics following mr hess s statement that there are no laws of genetics one could state that with each pregnancy they would have no idea if they would give birth to a human a cat or who knows what how ridiculous ! i m not even sure how he thought this anti probability chapter contributed to the central thesis of quiverfullness if anything it seems to take away from his argument since if god is soveign and totally unpredicatable then we have no reason to think that birth control would ever work anyway so what would it matter if we use it while the book makes an excellent case that children are a blessing and that christians should desire to be blessed with children it doesn t make a biblical case that the use of non abortifacient birth control is sin i think many christians would like the issue to be cut and dried but the truth is god does give us choices in life many times there are equally valid choices sometimes one choice is better than another choice but that doesn t make the lesser choice sinstill many informative interesting points are brought up in the book it is a quick read and probably worth the read for someone seriously investigating this subject in my opinion a much better read on this subject is birthing god s mighty warriors by rachel scott 
pray you don t need this book this book is an extremely difficult read paragraphs repeat often on section headers so often in fact it s apparent that no one including the editor has read the whole thing coherent outlines are fairly nonexistent review sections do nothing to prepare you for the ridiculous test bank questions included in the teacher s edition contradiction between text workbook and test bank are common if your instructors haven t the nerve to do some critical analysis of these questions your nursing career will start out in an extremely painful manner 
the economist i agree with much that has been said about pj s pathetic attempt at explaining economics pj is a humorist and should stick with that in fact if pj were true to smith s idea of specialization in capitalism he would stay clear away from a subject with which he has no expertise case in point pj seems to believe that a trade deficit with china does not truly exist pj might be a keen observer of human behavior but that may be all that he is 
pretentious garbage i tried reading it and made it about pages i m pretty sure that s a bad sign i seem to recall mr sedaris writing about his mother s bedpan or something the impression i instantly got was beep beep ! pretentious young writer peddling so called bad childhood experiences for fame money and sympathy guess what mr sedaris i don t give a expletive deleted about your so called bad childhood millions of people have bad childhoods and don t play the sympathy card check out augusten burrough s books they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style 
just awful instead of a testament to his climbing expeditions this book might best serve as a testament to what seems to be jim wickwire s blatant misogyny and egocentrism after detailing how he decided his wife should leave college to support him wickwire regales us semi boastfully with anecdotes relating how he expected his wife to be nothing more than a housekeeper child rearer and sex object his words after insisting on a large family and getting offended at a well meaning priest who gently suggested birth control wickwire by his own admission proceeds to by andlarge shirk his duties as a father to all five of his children supporting them only in the economic sense we then get to read his thoughts about the innate subordinism of female climbers and their tendency toward sexual hijinks on the mountains the brunt of wickwire s finger pointing rests solidly on the shoulders of the female climbers he discusses until he falls in love with marty hoey a talented female climber with the sense it seems never to have gotten seriously involved with wickwire despite his attempts to the contrary wickwire seems to read much into incidents like feet separated by different sleeping bags accidentally touching in a overcrowded tent after the reader is forced to endure reading a series of desperate petulant and adolescent notes and conversations directed from wickwire to hoey he recounts her death on everest perfunctorily for the most part and in terms of how his wife forgave him for this one sided indiscretion all things considered i m not sure who should be more outraged mary lou wickwire reading her husband s embarassing account of falling in love with hoey and knowing all her friends and peers will be reading it too or marty hoey herself to whom wickwire attributes a number of childish and maudlin love notes and who is no longer here to defend herself to be fair wickwire may not be the narrow minded boor he appears to be as when in he sadly acknowledges of the inevitable entry of women into the legal profession one wonders what rock he was living under or climbing over not to know that women entered the legal profession long before then the book while also hampered by a ridiculous title is full of stilted prose and dialogue in wickwire s world climbers never say things like weve gotta get down the mountain fast instead they make proclamations like we must descend quickly or we shall perish upon the mountain if they were climbing in king arthur s time maybe in this day and age no one speaks like that as a result the dialogue sounds stilted and fictitious even if it had a basis in fact the prose lingers too long and clumsily on wickwire s relationships with those around him even though his relationships seem rather shallow again this may be the fault of the co writer or the source one never knows i would heartily recommend saving your money and time and reading a more climbing related and less self centered and angsty text 
nearly worthless i bought this book because of the excellent reviews it got however upon reading this i can t see any justification for these reviews first of all it is very high level i mean appropriate for your manager s manager s manager maybe this book is all about fawning over diffie hellman and philosophizing about how pki should be used etc there is no technical information in this book no code no flow charts no diagrams no data structures it doesn t even explain how pki is applied for example to ssl all the real information in this book could have been condenced to a few pages i really needed this book to be good and it was not look if you want to go to a cocktail party and impress someone with no technical exposure then maybe this is your book otherwise there must be better choices 
what a disappointment i read the reviews here about this book and loves mysteries this one is a total bore 
ambition is the death of thought people say  again  and again that philosophy  doesn t really  progress  that  we are still occupied with  the same philosophical problems  as  were  the greeksbut the  people who say this don t understand why is has to be  so  it is because our language  has remained the same and keeps seducing  us  into  asking the  same  questions  as long as there continues  to be a verb  to be  that looks as if it  functions  in the  same way  as to eat and to drink as  long as we still havethe adjectives identical true

the limits of  human understanding  they believe of course that they can see  beyond these philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language ambition is the death of thought these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophy some years ago but most people have  yet to find this out dennett though he has been a philosopher  for some  years is one them  it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist john searle studied under famous wittgensteinians searle with john austin dennett with gilbert ryle but searle got the point and dennett did not dennett is a hard determinist though he trys to sneak reality in the back door and perhaps this is due to ryle whose famous book the concept of mind continues to be reprinted that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine dennett enjoys making the  mistakes wittgenstein ryle andmany others since have exposed in detail byaccidentjust before this book i had read the minds i which dennett coauthored with douglas hofstadter in  they made some  bad mistakes see my review and saddest of all they reprinted two famous articles that pointed the way out of the mess nagels what is like to  be a bat and an  early version of  john searle s chinese room argument  explaining  why computers don t think nagel pointed out that we do not even know how to recognize what a concept of a bat s mind would  be like  searle  similarly explained  how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking and how it differsfrom what a computer does egit can translate chinese without  understanding  it  likewise we lack a clear test for recognizing what counts as good vs  bad or just intelligible for many philosophical and scientific concepts  our use  of  the words consciousness choice freedom intention particle  thinking  determines wave cause happened event and so on  endlessly  are rarely a  source of confusion but  as soon as we leave normal  life and enter philosophy and any discussion detached  from the environment in which language  evolved  chaos  reigns  wittgenstein was the first to understand why  and to  point out how to avoid this unfortunately he died in his prime his works are composed almost entirely of a series  of examples of how the mind language works and he never wrote any popular books so understanding of his work is  restricted  to a very few searle is one of  the world s leading philosophers and has written many extremely clear and highly regarded  articles  and books some of which have pointed out the glaring  defects  in dennett sworkhis review consciousness explained  away of dennetts book consciousness explained  and  his book the mystery of consciousness are  very  well known and show in a way that is amazingly clear for philosophical writing why neither dennett nor any of the  hundreds of philosophers andscientists who have written on this topic havecome close toexplaining the hard problem ie how do you conceptualize consciousnessmany suspect we  will never be able to conceptualize any of the really important things but it is clear that we are nowhere  near it  now  dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has  favored searle with  vituperative personal  attacks searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is mostly a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious thinks etc he just points out that we don t have any idea how this happens searle characterizes as intellectualpathologythe views of dennett and all those who deny the existence of the very phenomena they set out to explain  dennett repeats his mistakes here and leaves his reply to his  critics to the penultimate page of the book where we are told  that they are all mistaken and it is a waste of space to show  how  unsurprisingly there is not one reference to wittgenstein or searle in the entire book there are however many references  to other old school philosophers who are as confused as he is like most people it does not cross his mind thatthe very  inference engines he thinks with are forcing him to come to certain conclusions and that these  will often be quite unconnected with or wrong about  the way things are in the  world they are a jumble of evolutionary curiosities which do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survival hundreds of thousands of years ago wittgenstein was a pioneer in doing thought experiments in cognitive  psychology and began to elucidate the nature  of these engines and the subtleties of language in the s and thus he made  the sorts of comments that this review begins with dennett says pthat his view is compatibilism ie that free will whichi hope we can equate with choice is compatible with determinism ie that there is at any instant exactly one physically possible  future p he  wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity  however the  whole book is smoke and  mirrors by means of which choice in the sense we  normally understand  it disappears and  we are left with choice which is  something  we cannot choose  naturally this echoes the fate of consiousness  in  his earlier book consciousness explained it is remarkable  that at a time  when we are just beginning to reach the point  where we might be able to  understand the basics of how a single  neuron works or how an atom works for that  matter that anyone should  think they can make the leap to understanding the whole  brain  and to explain its most complex phenomena  please recall the last  sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote and what smorethis satisfies a longing for the transcendent because insofar as peoplethinkthey can see the limits of  human understanding theybelieve of course that they can see beyond these the  relation between language  thought and reality is extraordinarily  complex and everyone gets lost  if one  is very very careful some understanding is possible but dennett throws  caution to  the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand there are at least different topics here evolution of our brain choice  and morality and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into  a coherent  account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic  crashing of atoms  there  is however no compelling reason to  accept that bouncing atoms or his favorite  example the game  of life running on a computer are isomorphic with reality  he  knows that quantum indeterminacy or the uncertainty principle is  a major  obstacle to determinism however defined and has been taken  by many as an escape  to freedom but dismisses it due to the fact  that such events are too rare to  bother with  by  extension  its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our  whole  lifetime in our brain so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain whatever that may be however the universe is a big place  and its been around a long  time perhaps forever and if even one  such quantum effect occurs it would seem  to throw the whole universe  into an indeterminate state  the notion there is  at any  instant exactly one physically possible future cannot be true  if at any  instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur in this case  there would seem to be  infinitely many possible futures  this  recalls one of the escapes from the  contradictions of physics each instant our universe is branching into  infinitely many universes he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness or any other emergent phenomenon if so they will definitely win at least one nobel prize for not only will they have explained consciousness they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence how higher order properties emerge from lower ones so they would have to solve the easy problem to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time ignoring uncertainty and the hard one what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable even for one atom or a vacuum as it would require an infinite amount of computer time but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws  of physics for  protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls but physics is  made of notions just as fantastic uncertainty entanglement wave particle duality schrodinger s dead alivecat etc and as feynmann said many times  nobody understands physics many think nobody ever will on pg he says our values have  little to do with the goals of our  cells and on pg to that  our personality differences are due to how our  robotic teams  are put togther over a lifetime of growth and experience  this  is a bald dismissal of human nature of the abundant evidence that  our  differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes  and fixed in early  childhood and is typical of his constant confused  wandering back and forth  between determinism and  environmentalism on page he notes that free will is  a problem and our attitudes to it make  a difference but for whom  nobody but philosophers  we  make choices  what s the problem  one has to step outside life to experience  a  problem and then everything becomes a problem  what are consciousness  pain  yellow intention matter quarks gravity etc  i doubt  that anyone has ever  experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions with people or their  decision making processes due  to their thinking about choice  this shows that  there is something  strange about such questions  wittgenstein would probably  say  that the language games are different  there are  games for language  connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing  colors etc and  thinking philosophically is operating  them in decoupled mode  decoupled modes permit thinking about  the past planning for the future  guessing the mental states  of others etc but if one takes the results in the  wrong way and  starts to think john will try to steal my wallet rather  than  just imagining that john might do it confusion enters and  those who cannot turn  off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode enter the realm of  pathology  some aspects of  schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this  way they lose control of which mode they are in eg not being able to see  the difference between the motives people have and the motives  they  might have one can then see much of the philosophizing  people do as operating in  these decoupled modes but failing to  be able to keep in front of them the  differences from the normal  mode  normal mode eg what is that lion doing  was undoubtedly  the first one evolved and decoupled modes what did that lion do  last time or what does he intend to do next evolved later  this was probably  never a problem for animals any animal that  spent too much  time worrying about  what might happen would not  be very successful contributing to the gene pool  it is interesting  to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began  degenerating genetically could large numbers of people survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes  hence we  have philosophy  and this book which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled  mode where there are no real consequences except earning royalties for putting  the results in a book for  other people to use to run their engines in decoupled  mode let us alter wittgenstein s quote to read as long as there  continues  to be a verb to decide  that looks as if  it  functions  in the  same way as to eat and to drink as long as we continue to talk of freedom  of action of  saying  i wish i had done otherwise etc etc people will  keep stumbling over the same puzzling difficulties and find themselves staring  at somethingwhich no explanation  seems capable of clearing  up as with most philosophy books nearly every page  often every paragraph changes from one  type of language game  to another without noticing that now one would have to be  joking  or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story etc and not  actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation  in the world  on  page he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our  lives like we count on food and  water but who ever outside philosophy standing  in front of lunch  counter full of food ever thinks how fine it is that they  have  free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water  even  if i want  to be a serious compatibilist and try  thinking this  in decoupled mode i have  to exit and enter nondecoupled mode  to make the actual choice  only then can i  go back to decoupled  mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had  the ability  to make a real choice  wittgenstein noted how pretend games are  parasitic on real ones this is not a trivial observation !  the ability to engage in very complex  decoupled  scenarios is already evident in year old children  so i would say that  normally nobody counts on having choice  but rather we just choose on the same page he shows  again that he does not grasp cognitive basics  he says we learn  to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice  and  that it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct as  eternal and  unchanging as arithmetic but it is not and on  page it is an evolved  creation of  human activity and  beliefs  the whole thrust of cognitive  psychology is that  we do not learn the basics of planning deciding promising  resenting  etc but that these are built in functions of the inference engines  that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in  very early  childhood  there is no evidence that they change  as we grow or are in any way  subject to our beliefs only that  they mature just  as our body does on pg he suggests its probable  that our having free will depends on our  believing we have it ! do  we believe we see an apple feel a pain are  happy  the language  game of belief is very different from that of knowing  we  can  believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and  look at it  we can t meaningfully then say that we still believe  it except as a joke etc  the inference engine can run in decoupled belief mode so we can imagine having choices or making them but in life  we just make them and it is only in very odd  situations we can  say that we believe we made a choice  but dennett is saying  this is the universal case  if making a choice had any dependence on  belief  than so would everything everything else consciousness seeing thinking etc if we take this seriously and he says  the serious problems of free will then  we are getting into  trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life then  madness  is minutes away on page et seq he discusses  causation intention and the informal predicates that we use  to describe atoms etc but cognitive resarch has shown  that we  describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories  which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when  agents ie animals or people or things like them ie ghosts or  gods are involved we use  our concepts engines for agency intuitive  psychology social minds etc to  decide how to behave  there  is almost certainly no causation module but rather  it will involve  all of these and other inference engines depending on the  precise  situation discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier  if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for  intuitive physics  agency ontological categories etc  of course  there is no mention here of  wittgenstein s many incisive comments  on causation intention deciding nor of  searle s now classic  works on intention and social reality he spends much  time on ainslie s book breakdown of will in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties ie inference engines by which  we evaluate probable outcomes hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism emotion and  economics but the book he cites was years old when this book was published it was bingham s idea amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson that  cooperation was  greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing  cheaters  he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that are obligatory and promising  indeed they are and in fact they are standard  parts  of economic evolutionary and cognitive theory but unfortunately  he makes  little reference to the other work in these fields all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them he does not establish any convincing  connection between this work and the general problem of choice onpg he says that making oneself so that one could not have done  otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free  will and that  we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves  insensitive to  opportunities but where this ability resides is  not revealed for several  chapters  dennett has a penchant  for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of  rather irrelevant  text  again he gets things backwards as there is a vast body  of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the  feelings  that we should behave in some way from our inference  engines and these are not  provided by some part of our conscious  self but by the automatic and  unconscious operation of the engines  as he notes hundreds of experiments with the  prisoner s dilemma and related  protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate  people s choices  and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at  all  when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious they are much slower and less reliable so there  has been constant pressure of  natural selection to make the engines  fast and automatic and inacessible to  deliberate thought dennett says we make ourselves so that we could not do  otherwise  and that this is the basis of morality and choice  the evidence  would  seem to be exactly the opposite  our inference engines give us basic  moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results  if we or others do not we feel  guilt outrage resentment etc  then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved our genes make us so we can tmostly do otherwise not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it we can  often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social  disapproval usually serve to limit our choices  these intuitions  evolved in  small groups between and some millions of years ago  in the modern world  the intuitions are often not to our  advantage and the social controls weak  this is a prime reason for the chaos in the world on pg he finally sneaks in a definition of  free  will  as a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look like decision making from certain angles he claims that this plays all the valuable roles  of free will but lacks some unspecified properties possessed by  traditional free will  the smoke is thick but i am  pretty sure one of  those unspecified properties is what we understand as choice he insists top pg that his naturalistic account of decision  making  leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility but making  ourselves so we  couldn t do otherwise does not seem to describe  the way we actually function  nor does it seem to leave any room  for morality as that would seem to consist  precisely in being  able to do otherwise he does not propose any test  for deciding if a choice is voluntary or  forced and i doubt he  could do so  normally if someone asks us to move our  hand we  know what counts as having a choice  but typical of philosophers  i  expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count  both as evidence for his position at this point he also starts his discussion of libet s well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time on page et  seq he sneaks in his definition of conscious will the brains user illusion of itself which has as one of its main roles  providing  me with the means of interfacing with myself at  other times and  illusory or not conscious will is the  persons guide to his or her own moral  responsibility for action  he says the trick we need is to see that i control what is  happening inside the simplification barrier where decision making happens mental events become conscious  by entering into  memory  the process of self description  is what we are  the crucial  thing is that choice is possible  because the self is distributed over space the brain and time memories he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous everyone who can follow this and really understands !  i know that many people find it hard to grasp this idea or take it seriously  it seems to them to be a trick with mirrors  some kind of verbal slight of  hand that whisks consciousness and the real  self out of the picture just when  it was about to be introduced  many will say he took the words out of their mouth but i would say it s incoherent and that everythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe making the obvious extensions of such claims was gone long before wegot this far on pg he says that culture has made us rational animals ! this is a stunning denial of human nature ie genetics and evolution coming from the person who wrote darwins dangerous idea presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space the brain and other people and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness line from bottom he says consciousness is a user interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain you will have to suffer through consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades social mind intuitive psychology coalitional intuitions etc and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture thats ok but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes we are also told here that r dby which he means evolution here but other things elsewhere has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality i am sure that he will get little agreement on this it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates and earlier long before spoken language though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain he continues morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake ! and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes which is an amazing and totally incorrect thing to say even if he was only referring to memes on pg he claims that because  we do not comprehend our bland dispositions to cooperate  they mean nothing to us but it is the operation of  our templates  that is everything to us  there is ample evidence that if one  of  them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being eg autism i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions like all the templates are accessible to consciousness we may decide our cheating was justifiable or forgive someone else s cheating but we still know it was cheating ie we cannot change the engine i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings another issue is that as culture developed one had to make many important or moral type decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer on pg he says that we now replace our free floating rationales probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines with reflection and mutual persuasion and on pg he says that it is a child s upbringing demanding and giving reasons that affects moral reasoning again he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last years of research the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self which takes responsibility it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition on pg he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education memory and sharing it s clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments on pg he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between oughtand is unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago ie they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes eg see the blank slate he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion this happens on pg where he states that concepts like praiseworthy were shaped over millennia by culture while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms on pg he tries to explain how an ess evolutionarily stable strategy can produce morality his idea here is that genetic rd produces dim understandings of morals and then culture memetics produces variations and clarifications i would say that we all know and much research has made clear that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability  he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore which i started reading years ago since it s authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein  dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us  but there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind  it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind  i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho s books than anywhere in philosophy one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities  there is no sign here nor in anything he has done that dennett is morally superior  after years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them it seems clear that like all of us he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines so how much opportunity is there to improve our morality  it seems clear eg see pinker s the blank slate that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties on average maybe of the variation in moral behavior variations are the only thing we can study is due to our own efforts  the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world  but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is and if one did we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is ! and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first to return to the quote at the beginning ambition is the death of thought indeed though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts 
high brow advice clearly john gardner is a literary genius however not being one myself i found that his style was a little overbearing it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that i was looking for 
total fiction it simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true while this theory of economic imperialism isn t technically impossible it s the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as ann coulter books make the right look bigoted and well stupid this is an incredibly implausible account and books like this claiming to be nonfiction undermine good writing and reporting everywhere shame on the author and the publisher the only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by berrett koehler the contents of which make it obvious that bk is simly a peddler of th rate crackpot theories all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety 
this is one of the worst economics textbooks ever i have to say that this is one of the worst economics textbooks that i have ever read the font is tiny and reading it strains my eyes the book is not written in a clear style at all in fact i often have to reread paragraphs just to understand what s going on sometimes the authors go into needlessly long and complicated tangents to explain simple concepts someone needs to seriously condense and clarify the material in this textbook or else it ll become the bane of every college economics student s existence 
a rare heinlein travesty this is the only heinlein work i don t like and have read only once and i ve read everything he wrote that i could get my hands on for more than thirty years since i was a teenager i ve literally worn out multiple softcover copies of several of his novels and starting to do the same in hardcover especially i will fear no evil and time enough for love i m sorry to say however heinlein completely lost me with job it s not a comedy it s a travesty 
where is the real anne rice hiding being a day late and a dollar short i finally decided to buy this book despite the poor reviews i could not get past the introduction by lestat anne saying how stupid we all are for not getting his her previous book she he failed to explain what exactly it was that we were supposed to get to my satisfaction anyway and the religious aspect of it all well i will keep my own council on that issue my theory regarding anne s later efforts is please do not take offence ms rice that anne lost her edge after her beloved husband died could it be that he had some part a large one in her previous novels the beautiful prose is gone from her writing and i think as her writing deteriorated her ego grew all i can say is anne stop writing retire open a doll hospital or be a spokesperson for charity kick back bake cookies enjoy your life just please do not torture us with any more writing 
history or fiction reynolds attempts to anchor the development of dzogchen in history rather than myth and he fails his style reminds me of a christian fundamentalist and i would bet that is his background trying to prove the historical accuracy of genesis he has an answer for every issue critics and objective historians have raised regarding the origins of dzogchen its early documents and their authors but almost all of those answers are unsupported by anything but conjecture and the pronouncements of lamas if you are a true believer this is probably the book for you but if you would like something of substance that trys to separate history from fiction and partisan conjecture i 
too blue i m embarassed that i read this all the way through the language expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff i don t live with people who talk like that and i don t understand the purpose sophistication to my mind the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with s 
i have been diagnosed with pdd nos and i find this book to have the same problem as all those other autism spectrum books discrimination they talk about pdd nos as meaning something is not quite right well perfectly normal isn t nt is not the right way to be just one way there is no right way to be we must learn to value diversity yes even if the person can t talk if they can t talk look at other ways of communicating but they are still wonderful people with beautiful minds and regarding the label pdd nos i dislike it too but for different reasons it is pervasive because it affects the basic way my mind works how i form concepts how i mentally represent things how my emotions interact with my reasoning and so many other things i can t quantify it it is developmental because it causes a different pattern of development whereas developmental delay is also developmental but affects the rate instead but i dislike the term for two reasons a it s vague as there are piles of conditions not on the autistic spectrum which are both pervasive and developmental and b the word disorder disorder in anglo saxon times meant evil whereas order meant good also my thought processes are orderly just have a different organization than most people it reminds me of how i always respond to questionnaires with questions about unpredicatable behavior i can predict my behavior but others often can t because they can t see all the internal stuff leading to it i think the idea of people as machines with one right way to work sort of works a bit with organs like the heart and lungs but definately not with the brain 
read blindness and pass on the plague dr rieux the main character of the novel moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner he goes thru the motions of doing his job while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague i find jose saramago s blindess to be a far superior book to the plague similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving the plague was clinical in its approach almost bloodless i found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re read often having to re read many pages over and over i would pass on this book 
dangerous misinformation suzanne somers apparently has no use for modern medical science especially as a survivor of breast cancer although of a very early stage she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones recent studies have shown that women who were taking hrt for protection from heart problems actually had more problems than normal menopausal women this is an unbelievably destructive horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously being skinny is not more important than being alive if you want to get the real scoop on hormones talk to a doctor at an academic medical center in other words one that isn t going to mislead the public for personal financial gain and see what she or he has to say chances are excellent that you ll be told to avoid them at all cost look at it this way are you going to put your very life in the hands of suzanne somers i m sure she s a very nice person it s just that she has no medical training whatsoever writing from an nci designated comprehensive cancer center 
the impractical approach to dw design if you work for a large corporation which has millions of to spend on dw projects maybe you should look at this book and even consider some of the ideas that it contains but if you need to develop a data warehouse using limited resources and within a certain timeframe your time will better used reading other books because following the inmon approach will lead you to an unnecessary complicated and expensive design i found that the arguments used by inmon to demonstrate the limits of the dimensional approach are not convincing at all for example at page he says because there is a different data structure for each data mart making any data mart into a data warehouse doesn t make sense having personally implemented several data warehouses using the conformed dimensions approach i can guarantee that it worked and produced a very elegant and clean data model 
heinlein s worst sorry standard heinlein disclaimer heinlein is a frequently polarizing figure in american literature the people who dislike his work eg a panshin seem to really dislike his work and often for reasons that seem to me spurious the people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of heinlein s problems as a writer i like heinlein s work quite a bit and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable but i would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the best of the sf genre they are for me however always enjoyable and that is no small thing to find in an author and as you may have guessed this is one of the two the other is rocketship galileo which in my opinion only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels and a hoary nazis on the moon plotline that to put it mildly has not worn well with time the story behind this book is apparently that heinlein was ill as he was finishing it and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed could be frankly it s hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable this is a relatively interesting idea a man s brain transplanted into a woman s body but as many others have pointed out the execution is poor frankly there s not much story here at all aside from a man exploring what it s like being in a woman s body but the exploration is by turns dull and absurd man in woman s body has many sexual flings ! man in woman s body poses nude for a painter ! man in woman s body cooks dinner for widower husband ! man in woman s body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless but he can run secretarial equipment ! the thrills never stop there are any number of other irritating things about this book personally i find being forced to try to pronounce joan as joanne really irritating but that s probably just me if you want it pronounced joanne spell it that way bob ! but i ll let you read the other reviews the summation is for this lover of heinlein who has read almost everything he wrote i can t reread this novel and for me folks that s really saying something 
hubbert s peak this book was on a very interseting topic the author took time in studying this topic it was about the impending world oil shortage that is the time when we the world will run out of oil it tells you about hubbert s analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from then they talk about where oil is they also talk about drilling for oil they say it takes people over drills to find oil sometimes it will take even more time then that then they talk about the size of oil fields they also reexamine hubbert s analysis later on in the book rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have hubbert was a brilliant man some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn t want to he told everybody the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about i wouldn t recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book 
a tale of one city would have been plenty dont buy this book ! or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long wow i mean talk about boreing is it the best of times or is it the worst of times you cant make up you re mind on page one sentence one even if i am this guys editer i would have told him to just write about the best of times thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow only one star for you but keep trying youll get there 
this just sucked i think i m done with the mrs murphy books this one was so bad i couldn t even finish it i actually threw it away it s time for the author to move on these characters have become downright boring 
i hope i ll be able to find something better than this book i have found this book very difficult to enjoy to begin with the first chapter is spent telling me that i can do it ! the writing is condescending and achieves the opposite of the intended motivation the cartoons are stupid and not comical while reading you ll quickly learn that the author offers a service to you the aspiring inventor reese as your partner will take your idea help you develop it package and pitch it and negotiate the contract in exchange you split the royalties with him this sounded like a great idea to me your idea combined with his knowledge and skills could produce great results it s a win winso i looked into his website for him to consider your idea you must pay a dollar fee the concept is that this fee is nominal compared to typical lawyer fees its object is to prove that you are serious and so that reese is not swamped with ideas the real payday for reese is when you get paid too with royalties for licensing your idea i am a college student and cannot afford to swing dollars so easily so i requested that he waive the fee and hear my idea i assured him i was serious and that i believed my idea had great potential after all the big money is in the royalties not the dollar initial fee reese declined the offer he said that it would be poor business practice to offer different prices to different people i am very objective and i am not offended that reese declined my offer but to address reese s inability to modify prices consider that car dealers negotiate prices department stores have sales and of course amazon will sell you this book for less than your local bookstore i quote reese from page while we re on the subject of fees if the price quoted is more than you can afford it s quite appropriate to ask if the attorney can come down a bit reese unintentionally enlightened me to the nature of his operation the dollars is so important for a very good reason the dollar fee may seem nominal compared to the fees of a lawyer but reese is dealing with many more clients than a lawyer one thousand ideas submitted is worth i know that if you re reading this review you have an idea you don t know what to do with it and you can t afford to spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer to find out reese knows this too this is perfect marketing im not suggesting that reese doesn t do what he claims i m sure he takes ideas and markets them and makes money for himself and the inventors however i question what percentage of submitted ideas he acts on if he was successful with a significant percentage it may have been lucrative for him to at least hear my idea the message reese sent is clear the dollars is more relevant than the potential of the idea i give this book two stars because i commend reese for his clever approach at earning a buck i feel he is unethical and he condemns most of his own practices in this book however when it comes down to the bottom line reese isn t breaking any laws and he s trying just like you and me for that million dollar payday 
not what i expected i ordered found and i expected some cute sadand sometimes heart wrenching reading material i was very surprised to say the least if the description of the book had include the phrases excess profanity and porn material enclosed i would not have ordered them i think you should warn readers that these books are xxx rated 
a disappointment i had respect for prof wheeler and so this book came as a tremendous disappointment it does little but trot out all the latest fringe theories about a woman who has already been the subject of numerous myths and dubious theories already 
this story has been proven totally false do a search on the true story find out what really happened and how her therapist actually created and named the personalities also you will discover that this author knew the truth about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
my kids won t eat this stuff this might work for families with older teenagers but my kids and just won t eat things like baked fish or squash or eggplant they re not picky kids we travel extensively and they ll eat all kids of food but i d say four out of five of the recipes in this book were failures at my dinner table it s a good place to start if you have no idea how to cook for a family but i ve had much more success with cooking light 
flowery prose in a dull pointless illogical story robin hobb knows how to write well and proved it with assassin s apprentice unfortunately she seems to be in love with her descriptive prose and forgets mundane items such as plot action and likable or at least interesting characters ship of magic suffers from an excess of flowery prose adorning a dull meandering story containing uninteresting and mostly unlikable characters i read a quarter of the book and stopped some of the mostly glowing reviews claim that the book gets better but my patience dwindled to naught specific things i disliked another hobb book in which magic but inanimate objects the wood of the liveship come to life only after multiple people three generations of ship owners in this book die while touching the object can t her magic creatures have lives and personalities of their own teens and young adults rarely learn from mistakes and repeatedly act stupid maybe they are all budding politicians the interwoven story of sea serpents from some other plane of existence is distracting because of lack of context it probably will make sense later but it adds nothing but confusion in the early chapters hobb should have started the book at the middle or near end of the story so we would know the importance of the serpents and the liveships and then gone back in time the members of the main family are mostly unlikable the only likable one has unrealistic lines the yearold acolyte talks like a yearold philosopher 
disappointed i was hoping for a book that had actual plans and dimensional drawings of various coops instead this book is more of an ideas book or a grand tour of various coops that people have built definitely a disappointment 
individualism without mercy and without pity ayn rand s fictional story about when the engine of the world stopped is rather poorly written the philosophical perspective presented in some of the speeches and some of the events in this overly long story is individualism that knows no restraint i got the feeling while reading this book that there was no such thing as society no such thing as kindness or compassion in fact it seemed like compassion and kindness were moral faults to be sneered at anyway the story was second rate at best and kind of horrifying at worst judging the literary quality of a book may be a matter of taste however i am not alone in considering the book to be poorly written the specific areas where it is wanting in quality are there the characters are poorly developed and seem to exist mainly to advance the philosophical agenda of the author the situations and conversations presented in the story lack credibility what person have you ever met who launches into a or page philosophical presentation while courting or love making the bad characters are bad mostly because they think that social responsibility and compassion matter somehow compassion is a vice that the author distorts until it cannot be recognised such departures from real life experience that we all share really degrades the story line into parody again this is done to advance the philosophical agenda of the author the parody is not intentional it is merely the product of poor composition the story is at time interminably verbose what could be said in a few lines is stretched out into tedious pages by the author because she had an inadequate ability to write in the english language verbosity does not clarify and it does not improve a story line i am sure that this book appeals mainly to people in their later teens before they gained enough life experience and enough good sense to reject the stupidity that the author seems to think is a virtue 
read the kjv please this bible is not the true god s word it has been changed too much i believe that the kjv is the true bible god died for our sins he shed his blood so that we might have everlasting life but only if we belive this bible is written to make you feel good about yourself all we are sinners destined for hell and damnation god was not brought into this world just to make us feel good about ourselves but to make us feel a need to repent from our sin we cannot get to heaven in eternity unless we believe in the lord jesus christ 
a horrible textbook this text is a nightmare terms are poorly defined if defined at all and examples are few and far between the illustrations are laughable i ve seen better graphics in nursery books written years ago if your professor assigns this text and you re new to java be prepared to shell out more bucks for better sources or cruise the internet to get the answers you need this book won t provide them 
done with dean i have listened to a bunch of dean koontz books while listening to the second one i saw so many similarities which really turned me off and this flaw continued which each book i listen to which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book however most of the stories were pretty good so i stuck with him this is not the case with this book cold fire is absolutely horrible i so regret purchasing this book it is so bad that i have decided to swear off dean for looooooooong while just on a side note the bad place is the first dk book i read and it was very entertaining 
virtually fraud be warned the office project program advertised as included is a trial version the ad does not say this now i have to turn around a buy a new program amazon customer service says it isn t their fault i really needed the book and the program for a class due to start in four days now i m really stuck amazon is even trying to get me to pay for the return shipping 
poor investment a redundant and poorly written tome that does not answer the important questions 
slow convoluted read lacks any gripping force and it is an effort to work thru i 
dull trite maudlin amp cliched this is probably one of the worst books ever published st of all it is trying to be allegorical when it really isn t kafka is great allegory innocence is not her ramblings read like bad confessional poems like sharon olds she had every cliche being trapped underwater blood melodrama etc the ironic thing is that this book is so bad you won t forget it so i do recommend it so people can see how bad it really is the sad thing is that there was a review written by a young girl who liked this crap amp said how it has quotinspiredquot her to be a writer sheesh this is why bad writing does us no good this book is easy to write and easy to read and it gives hopefuls who can t see jane s lack of talent hope just as sharon olds gives bad women poets hope ugh 
still excellent but old in the tooth and preposterously overpriced well i guess it s been a while since i ve been a college student i m a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now i guess all college texts have ridiculous prices this book used to be the best reference i ve ever seen on basic electronics for non ees and even for non engineers it s not much of a cookbook instead it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you re designing or adapting the second ed is getting long in the tooth and since the book is used as a college text it s preposterously overpriced the one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the otherwise excellent exercises and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you re not sure about it will be interesting to see what the rd ed looks like maybe i ll start a web site and publish the answers online 
stick to romance sparky sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing the guardian this book is awful the storyline is weak and predictable the dialogue is excruciatingly lame and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry there is virtually no romance which is the reason to read sparks books i can t tell you how many times i rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said the way the dog seems to be human and the predictability of the plot this book is so poorly written and so lame i have trouble believing sparks wrote it if you want a good plot with romance mixed in read message in a bottle or a walk to remember if you want suspense read mary higgins clark or agatha christie they do a far better job with it than sparks does 
not what was promised by the seller the book was advertised with cd i received no cd in it when i contacted abebook they send me e mail that i have to complain to amazon 
disappointing this book started out with some interesting ideas and character development but fizzled quickly in the first few chapters we are introduced to joanna who is coming of age in a supernatural way then she hides out in a sanctuary for nearly the entire remainder of the book ! basically talking incomprehensible mytho babble and contemplating her navel i couldn t even finish the book i was so bored by the time she finally planned to face the bad guys that i didn t even care how the big battle turned out and i just closed the book without reading it 
a true disappointment this book is very disappointing poorly written and with weak descriptions leaves the inexperienced outdoorsmen with a false sense of security just because there happens to be a section on a particular skill does not translate into the ability of the reader to follow the lousy instructions to complete said skill if anyone wants to learn survival skills they would be well suited to take a course and view first hand the execution of the skills by an experienced practitioner of them purchase another book and let this one pass 
typical paranoid nonsense typical left wing quotvast right wing conspiracy quot nonsense only the most paranoid americans looking through the peepholes of triple locked doors would recognize the place this book is about and apparently from where it was written 
great marble ilustrations but try and find the description this book has fabulous marble illustrations but absolutely no cross referencing so a user can look up the description of the marble pictured the author pre supposes you are an expert and know what marble maker and type you are looking for illustrations are grouped together in one section of the book and each is identified only by the auction number and lot number it came from unfortunately the descriptions of these marbles are not in the same order descriptions are ordered by marble manufacturer and type of marble even then the auction numbers within the types are random the book is only useful if you know what kind of marble you have and want to see what some similar marbles by the same manufacturer sold for it bogles the imagination to understand why any sensible editor would not cross index this publication so a person finding a marble they like in the illustrations can then go read the description it could take you a week to find the matching description the sad thing is that data was readily available to the author and the illustrations could have been keyed in a day ! worst example of editorship i have ever seen ! totally clueless ! they never thought about or cared how a person might try to use the book save your money ! i wish i had 
unendurable this book was on somebody s amazon com listmania for sea turtles so i hunted it down it is only vaguely about sea turtles in that it is set on an island in georgia where sea turtles nest there is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book and then he disappears so it s obvious that he was involved in the crime there are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable i wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and i ended up skimming the whole thing looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction skip this book and send your to a sea turtle hospital instead 
it s all about me and the booty i just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece s meeting with sean but first the review in order not to diminish the previous reviews i will just focus on the whole war talk on page no messing around here sean states we must take the war to them rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood wow bring it on dude oh you mean let s send somebody else s kid to fight right on page he drills that point in with id like to see the good governor dean present a case that there s any higher moral cause than defending one s innocent countrymen against terrorist attack if it s such a great moral cause sean why oh why ain t you out there with the rest of my family does this by the way mean you are immoral since you punked out i never thought of myself as moral just because i volunteered and served as a paratrooper in vietnam is military service only for democrats and brown people should we have a new draft catagory such as r for republican which means you don t have to serve to paraphrase frank purdue it takes a tender man to spout tough talk page puts down democrats im a democrat who served in vietnam or am i repeating myself with when it comes to the hitlers the brezhnevs the saddams pussyfooting is the order of the day yeah sean tell me what you really think well sean some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you dowhat and wasn t the bush family in business with hitler during wwii here is really why this guy is full of himself my niece visiting me before heading to the gulf and her first combat tour spotted him in dc she introduced herself and told him she was a fan when she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book saying he would ship it to her she is very polite and told him he didn t have to sean insisted she wrote her address down before heading overseas i asked her if sean had sent the book as promised no and no surprise for me so me being me i contacted sean by email twice but got not reply too busy impressing all those other servicewomen i guess sean hannity not just by this book but by his actions is a coward blowhard and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen his book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book you should be ashamed of yourself sean but that would mean taking a moral position wouldn t it 
spanish madness perhaps there is a novel somewhere in the midst of this story of a seville policeman attempting to solve a series of gruesome murders only to find himself investigating his own family history a large part of the book are the journals left by the detective s father a fearless legionnaire turned famous painter these give an interesting view of spain before and after the civil war and contain some artistic insights there are also interesting thematic connections throughout the book centering around ideas of blindness and of memory and wilson at his best writes quite well there is one superb bullfight sequence near the end but at his worst he descends to the foreign phrasespattered tourism of a dan brown furthermore the police procedural makes an inadequate container for all this the plot is all too clearly assembled rather than evolving naturally and the depths of tormented psychology and even perversion revealed are just too macabre to be put to rest by the inadequate ending 
shallow roots based upon other positive reviews i had high hopes for this book being informative but it bases its data more on speculation than on fact when this book was first written at the time of the revolution in the author wrote that he had heard that israeli soldiers were part of the shah s defense forces in attacks against anti shah rioters but twenty years later by the time of this re publication the author had not been able to ascertain that israeli units had indeed been part of the shah s defense forces speculation on rumor but no determinable fact although the anti shah forces had twenty years to comb through iranian documents as the author presents a thin bone background to the theology of shi ism a reader is left powerfully hungry in looking for some meatiness to the author s explanations although this book is based upon four lectures that the author gave shortly after the revolution the author rambles about in trying to make some coherent story the author explains that the shiite are split between two schools of thought the usuli and the akhbaris as to whether or not modern shiites can engage in independent reasoning with respect to legal questions in the absence of the hidden imam the author examines this issue as it underpins the development of ayatollah khomeini s rebellion against the shah khomeini argued that shiite imams needed to take an active role in fomenting islamic rebellion against the pro secular shah rather than remaining passive the author all too briefly notes one of the imams complaints against the shah that he was taking mosque controlled lands and selling it to private individuals and thereby curtailing their income from those properties the author does not hide his pro shiite faith in response to one question asked of the author in as to whether or not he agreed that if national boundaries were taken away the differences between sunni and shi i would disappear in one instant the author replied back then very definitely however twenty years later by the author apparently had had a good dressing down by his shi i superiors and had to add a corrective footnote the differences themselves are deep rooted and ultimately irreducible pg this is not a book to read to learn about shi ism it is more of a television talking heads presentation based from several public lectures a lot of polemics but short on fact regarding riot casualties it barely rates being worthwhile for reading in understanding how the anti shah movement developed it is barely worth reading for a background feel as to why religious leaders imams should be the only ruling leaders of an islamic government mujtahid the people may vote for only those candidates who have prior approval from the imams and who toe the shi i theology this isn t a textbook it is more of a compilation of off the cuff extemporaneous remarks in a lecture hall okay for a novice just starting to explore this topic but read it at the library before buying it 
as if by magic daniel dennett s excellent book consciousness explained extracts a very funny cartoon from scientific american in which two professors stare at a blackboard showing a formula full of complex algebra in the middle of the formula appears the sentence then a miracle occurs one professor points to the statement and says to the other i think you should be more explicit here in step two roger penrose isn t just any old boffin he is the emeritus rouse ball professor of mathematics at oxford university and has been knighted for his services to science the emperor s new mind is his attempt to crack that perennial philosophical chestnut the consciousness artificial intelligence problem penrose s view is that strong ai is simply wrong and that a computer could never replicate functionally or actually what we know as consciousnessright take a deep breath here for it s a scary thing for a mere mortal with a decidedly ordinary bachelor s degree in the humanities to say something like this about the one of the cleverest men on the planet but i can t see any way around it in this book roger penrose completely totally misses the point insofar as it s considered an entry on the consciousness ai debate the emperor s new mind all pages of it is all but worthless there i said it then again nearly of those pages don t even purport to be about consciousness so perhaps all is not lost instead they contain an extremely dense at times fascinating but uniformly and i use the word deliberately dazzling overview of the more esoteric parts of modern mathematics physics and cosmology while penrose thinks it is necessary background it isn t it amounts to an extremely long winded appeal to authority one is left with the firm impression that the rouse ball professor of mathematics at oxford university is a very very smart chap and that one really ought to see that what ever he says goes this is no small irony given the title of his book for if anyone is holding himself out as being a tailor purveying a cloth that only the cleverest people can see it s roger penrose heres where i think he goes wrong firstly his attempt to undermine the ai position is founded on purely mathematical reasoning pure mathematics is a closed logical system its truths aren t falsifiable so by themselves have no explanatory force mathematical statements such as are necessarily true for all time and all universes so ipso facto they can t by themselves tell us anything about any particular universe yet that is just what penrose asks them to do he invokes gdel s theorem of undecidability perhaps to counter the argument i have just made but it isn t convincing being logically unable to prove all truths in a particular set even though you know they are true is very different from being able to falsify them without that power you have no explanatory traction in the outside world penrose s entire attack on strong ai is based on an unfalsifiable and therefore non content carrying argument another error is to assume an algorithm must have been designed for the purpose for which it is used and must work perfectly to be of any use natural selection illustrates that this is simply not the case an algorithm may have a number of useful unintended by products and an algorithm can be extremely useful even when we know it to be completely misconceived at every level take newtonian mechanics as a good example we ve known for a century it isn t correct but in most practical circumstances it works fine which brings me to my next point for all the learning penrose includes on mandelbrot sets phase space entropy and hawking radiation the emperor s new mind is conspicuous for what it leaves out the bibliography contains no reference to karl popper nor the general philosophy of science which might have helped him on the issue of falsifiability nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind ai question daniel dennett is barely mentioned dennetts writing probably represents the forefront of the consciousness debate nor is richard dawkins well referenced despite having written compellingly and being a zoologist with a great deal more expertise on the question of algorithms in natural selection indeed penrose doesn t clearly present the arguments of any particular supporter of strong ai but rather chooses to generalise loosely as if he is convinced his mathematical deductions can carry the day and that ai doesn t present a significant challenge douglas hofstadter is given a little space and john searle and his largely discredited chinese room experiment a fair space but other than that the only philosopher penrose seems to be aware of is plato another thinker penrose doesn t seem familiar with is william of occam instead of doing some background reading and applying a little common sense penrose has launched a theory which as he proudly proclaims takes us to the ends of time and the universe and back to the smallest subatomic particles to explain in ways he freely admits he doesn t understand an everyday prosaic but still extremely hard to grasp phenomenon in its interstellar journey penrose s theory drifts very close to dualism and close but not quite so close perhaps to positing or needing some sort of god to work that will give succour in some quarters but not the ones penrose has in mind i suspect occams razor would require that such untestable and speculative suppositions be rejected unless no other explanation is available penrose would protest there are none dennett dawkins hofstadter and their colleagues and adherents including me would beg to differ and point to a lot of literature that penrose hasn t read in any case one would think that penrose s own intuition which he claims helps him to see truth despite gdel undecidability ought to help him see his theory is as jeremy bentham would say nonsense on stilts ultimately when penrose says quantum theory explains consciousness he is really saying no more than something magic happens or even then a miracle occurs mr penrose i think you should be more explicit here in step two olly

disappointing in today s pace driven world i was looking forward to a little respite in james ogilvy s book unfortunetely it didn t deliver for me what suggests to be a guide to finding creativity and fulfillment ends up being nothing more than the author s sterile philosophical rantings actually i don t know how it ended since i only made it through half the book i would have liked less history and more quotevidencequot or anecdotes from the author s life that promote this way of living ogilvy wants to sell us on quotgoallessnessquot but doesn t offer any kind of convincing argument too bad since i would tend to agree with this point of view ! 
a book about highschool drama after reviewing the novel teacher the one who made a difference by mark edmunson i would give it two stars this book was about a boy and his high school memeories and how in the end a teacher made a difference on his future this book only relates to the teacher every so often until the last chapter where finally the author lets us the reader know how his future was affected by the teacher throughout the book i felt like the reading was pointless and had no relation to the title i learned more about the football plays than i did about the author being affected by his teacher the good thing though was some of the stories were interesting but at points they were hard to understand the author would be explaining one thing and then quickly switch over to another making the book at some points have no organization also the use of big words seemed sort of ridiculous just because the tone of the book was so casual the words were very out of place his use of analogies with philosophers and characters in the book was also something that kept my interest if it wasnt t for the few funny stories and the intersting analogies i feel i would have tossed this book away a long time ago 
disorganized i found this book to be poorly written and disorganized it also mentions some products in general terms but never tells what the products are 
it gets star for the cover of the book which i liked this book was so horrible it was given to me by one of my friends for christmas i m so glad i didn t actually part with legal tender for this putrid novel i forced myself through the book not caring what happened to any of the characters who were flat and boring it was the biggest waste of time like something you d read in a wgs class and why is it that the only story i ever come across in anthologies by this woman is where are you going where have you been is this her best story how pathetic 
neither organizing nor simplicity i was disappointed with this book there were a few worthwile tips such as going to bed early to take advantage of the more productive morning hours but mostly the author solved her problems by throwing money at them if i could pick anywhere in the country i wanted to live buy coats and hire people to run all my errands hey i d be organized too ! as for simplicitythere is nothing here that anyone with even a passing familiarity with the simplicity movement would recognize 
bad parenting looking at the reviews here it seems that a lot of people can relate to the author s experiences basically what that tells me is that there is a lot of bad parenting going on these days for example when i was growing up i never talked back to my parents or slammed my bedroom door in protest to something they did or said in fact i never even thought about it if i had ever done such a thing i guarantee you it would ve never happened more than once mind you my dad was not a cruel man and not really very strict but being disrespectful like the kids are in this book was something that was simply not tolerated my mom recently told me a story the first time my parents took me to a restaurant when i was little and i started screaming and carrying on like most kids do my dad took me out to the parking lot and beat my a after that they never had any problems with me in public again i guess there s nothing like a belt to make a misbehaving kid see the error of their ways when i first started reading this book i thought some of the stories were pretty funny but in a sad sort of way as i kept reading i began to think that this guy was simply unfit to be a parent hint if your kids act this way you might try a little thing called discipline instead of letting your kids walk all over you 
poor beautiful me an interesting thing happens when people write memoirs of terrible things that happened to them readers are afraid to say anything bad about the books themselves because it looks like they re being unsympathetic towards the tragedies described i felt for dani shapiro when her father died but without that incident this reads like the work of a self obsessed rich b tch who epitomizes solopsism nothing in the world matters to her but her own experience and what people think of her it is very important by the way that you think she is beautiful as she reminds you constantly throughout the book that to me is the quality of someone who hasn t quite worked out her own problems someone who is sadly aware of how she acts and says and what you think of her as a result and someone who is probably not completely honest with you dear reader because the ugly parts of her the ones for which you won t feel sorry for her are most likely omitted 
a real disappointment an admiring though shallow and poorly written account of a unique american genius though salted with several good anecdotes gordon s book mostly relies on the research and interviews of others and ultimately does little to explain mckinley morganfield s life and times for a writer who presumes to account for the life of a musician gordon s descriptions of various waters recordings are especially poor far far better is his video documentary of the same name one suspects the book is the assembled notes of that project 
no dept i expected something of a mystery with plot development wow the plot never got higher than quots off the ground the story was weak without any mystery and it had no development of charaters the dialogue seemed to be at a th grade level because the story s character seemed to behave as th graders if you read ludlum clancy demille follet don t spend time opening this book for those reviewers who thought this book had great insights into behind the scenes work of the government you need to expand your reading list the idea of the purple dots could have been a great story but it never got off the launch pad most people have more excitement driving to work than what this story provided 
ho hum sorry its not what i expected i kept thinking where is this going it just wasn t funny it reminded me of something written years ago but that s not to say someone familiar with portuguese linguistics maybe a german academist or an up incoming dr dr longname etc etc hrumph cough could not read between the lines and find this humorous it was just a little dry and boring to me after the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors it got tiring i read every single book in the ladies detective series and couldn t wait to sink my teeth into the next precious ramotswe story this however was a disappointment i m only sorry i bought all in the series sight unseen based on the other books i d read by alexander mccall smith 
i don t know what s to like about this book interesting and suspect that there is only one review and of course its quotravingquot this book has not merit and is not worth the time it takes to read it 
medical ageism is extermination of the weak callahan s arguments for healthcare rationing based on age are neither valid nor logical more importantly they are not consistent with the united states federal civil rights laws that are enforced by the office for civil rights ocr of the u s department of health and human services dhhs nor are they moral in the international community by review of the united nation s universal declaration of human rights http wwwunorgoverviewrightshtml 
shoudl be stars there is a reason there are used ones of this book we used this book in for our men s study group and every one of the men and every one of the wives agreed that this was a worthless book it was written for a s wife that no longer exists now truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are discovering the mind of a woman by ken nairif only he knew by gary smalleytogether forever how to overcome problems and rekindle the love in your marriageby anne kristin carrollthey are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband 
the book of pretentiousness nothing can prepare you for this work no one in the history of literature has written with more pretentiousness and self indulgence how pessoa can present himself as both pathetic and heroic at the same time is a miracle of narcissism in contemporary terms this is like an adolescent blog he dismally attempts to disguise his platitudes as lyrical profundity 
horrible this book did not define any good portrayal of anything it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about that is rediculous i want a refund this book is a f 
overrated i bought this based on the effusive praised heaped by other reviewers here but it was a waste of time and money don t bother unless you like your plots thin your prose repetitive if i read palace that may only be told of in song one more time i swear i am going to hurt someone and your characterization feeble of historical interest only 
just so so of the or so grisham novels ive read this one is my least favorite its not a bad story at all but it s just way too long about pages longer than it needed to be it also just lacked credibility in many spots grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible if not really interesting most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that ive always thought were fascinating this book however plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work the other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for mark sway the year old protagonist he sounds more like a street wise year old using words like wonderful and phrases that have been out of use since the s i think grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters this isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
sort of awful the biographer is so obsessed with eliot s enigmatic inner state that she forgets to mention the things that happened to him during his life gordon speaks of eliot s desire to enlist in wwi without ever explaining why she never mentions his attitude toward world war ii she doesn t say that he was expelled from high school what he majored in at college what his income was during his years of fame what kind of contact he kept in with his family and how they thought of him later in his life what kind of contions he liked to write under in the early years why he put so many allusions in his poetry if he disdained allusion hunting on the other hand we do get excruciatingly detailed biographies of women like emily hale mary trevelyan and vivienne haighwood the book tries to bore into eliot s psyche and present all of his poetry as autobiographical despite the damage done to readings of both the life and the poetry 
save your money this book is awful i have read the entire thing and it says nothing that is useful i have been in public accounting for years and i am now ready to start my own firm i wasted my money on buying this book i know it is tempting to buy since the title is exactly what i was looking for but trust me choose another book the accounting guild website that the author constantly refers to is no longer in existence 
overblown connections to soc socrates would cringe that his name is in the title and that the author attempts to draw connections to his guru self help style and the great greek philosopher do not get me wrong the book is cute and filled with some nice cotton candy insights but there is no way any devotee of socrates would recognize this thinkers profound complexity and revolutionary approach to dialogue in this writer s one dimensional philosophy and intellectulizing 
a turgid pretentious anti war allegory no wonder there is so little said about this award winning faulkner work it is a chore to read only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story worse than that the characters are like rorschak blots with the christian mythology mixed in stick with faulkner s southern writings for characters who remain in your memory and images that are profound 
random i listened to naipaul s nobel lecture and found many of the things he touched on in that speech echoed in this short work naipaul speaks at length about growing up in trinidad and of the people he encounters he speaks about his education he also speaks about his father s short stories reading this book gives one a good sense of what led naipaul to his first novels as well as what led him to his later ones the somewhat puzzling ending wraps up the writer s pessimism re the future of the novel which i found disingenuous it s both unconvincing and the ultimate ingratitude to the form that won him the nobel prize 
boring dog trainer the book is fine except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer she s such a boring character she s young but not motivated to work in fact she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men and get support the point is that she doesn t enjoy the job thus a detailed description of her dog training job which she doesn t seem to enjoy was just a boring digression 
please don t read this what a terrible book it s slow and mostly pointless at times think of all the excitement you have working in a cubical with situations much less funny than those you d see in office space that is the premise of this book i went into this book thinking this a great author all the characters are about my age i d love to see what working in microsoft was like when things were just starting to get huge my friends and i are all computer nerds this is exactly what it are going to be like when i graduate college this year i was wrong on all counts there is nothing i as a year old tech savvy internatioanl business major could relate to it lacks an interesting plot it lacks characters the reader can enjoy the only reason i m giving it stars is because of a few mildly interesting situations scattered few and far between in the book go read anything else 
an unreliable guide when you are a big movie fan it s a good thing to get yourself a reference book to keep track of all things film although this particular volume is not bad to have around it has some major flaws especially in the review department there seems to be no continuity from review to review because there are so many different people writing reviews there is no general opinion of what makes a good movie how is it possible that the same source gives a thrown together mess like armageddon three and a half stars and a superb satire like fight club a turkey rating the review of fight club is so far off it really seems that the author didn t even see the movie there are more examples as well that induce some head scratching with a guide such as this you need to have a kind of general opinion that gives you an idea of when to buy into the reviewers advice i ve bought the last five or six volumes of this guide and found the videohound golden movie retreiver book to be far superior and chock full of extras that over the years this book didn t have or had to get rid of to put in more questionable movie reviews i ve actually rented movies based on highly recommended reviews within the video and dvd guide that were bad calls not bad if kept in the bathroom for quick reference but definitely not for coffee table presentation if you are a hard core movie buff 
you will finish the book i had to finish it even though i knew exactly what would happen he grabbed me at the beginning and i looked forward to reading my book every night then he just lost me and i found acts of faith to be predictable and at times boring the religious aspect traditions rituals were all interesting however the storyline became long and drawn out i could see why some might like it but personally i need a few more twists and a bit more excitement it s another book to put on the shelf that may or may not be a conversation piece one day 
it s awful i read this book this last year in highschool for english class it was awful ! first of all it s really confusing and second of all it s just a stupid plot and ending it was so boring and so long don t read it it s a waste of time 
nostradamus prophecies fulfilled and predictions for millen order the book nostradamus by stephen skinner francis king than 
not bad but not really good eithier this was my first reading of jamaica kincaid she has a short concise style which made me often feel like i was reading poetry however i felt that it also had some downsides like stifling character growth in lucy the title character comes to america to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother who for some reason she hates i wish we knew a bit more about lucy like why she hated her homeland so much it was an alright quick read but had it been longer i doubted it would have held my attention 
waste of time this book was a day in the life of an average nobody with average problems average kids average ex husband and all of that trivial stuff that doesn t warrant being written about my life is more interesting and that s not saying much 
pass i enjoy books on skepticism and i was looking forward to reading this one unfortunately i had to force myself to finish it because it is very boring dont bother 
an ok book the writer has great style and all but it s really written for newcomers to this profession i was impressed by the title of the book i like the presentation but what s really lacking is the content when i dig into it i had reasonably high expectation of the book that it s for the takeyourcareertothenextlevel readers seasoned office professionals however it disappoints me in this department the information provided particularly in the appendix is relevant to the us but may not be the case for other parts of the world the concepts and principles are useful having worked and still do in large american corporations i find it easy to relate to the book having said all that it still makes a great book for everyone who is new and aspires to be the best admin you could possibly be a kickass assistant happy reading 
tedious i was very disappointed in this book i found it tedious rambling and disjointed there were a few interesting facts thrown in for good measure but you have to slog through so much drivel that the trip just isn t worth your time 
an essay concerning human meandering not just simple ideas in this one but stupid ones too no one should ever read this colossal waste of time unless by reading you mean beating yourself unmercifully on the face and head until death occurs 
legalism to tha max justifaction santification and holiness are all linked to one thing the finished work of christ guys like this say we are justified by faith but were are pertty much on are own when it comes to living the life of a christian the eph and many othe rscriptures state that we are present tense justified santified and glotified by any effort of our own o foolish jerry who has bewiched you you stated in the spirit are you made perfect by the flesh surrendering of the will not will power is the key to the christians walk only god is holy how do we become holy the same way the temple became holy gods spirit resided there whos temple you are he says he tried the let go and let god method of holiness and failed so it was false he then says try his method but do not be discouraged by constant failures and setbacks read hebrews and do not try to do it but trust god and apprehend it for yourself by faith and faith alone brother stop laying burdends on others you yourself can not bear 
unable to deliver unable to deliver this calendar now i have been told that it will be until march until i might receive it imcompetant compan 
not a happy book if you really love cats and hate to hear about them being in pain then dying dont read this book camuti is very preachy sounding and makes regular cat owners seem like idiots he seems like he couldnt care less about a cat dying in pain an example of this is when in his book he tells loving owners who have to leave their cat in camuti s care over christmas not to leave a little christmas tree in the cats cage they just felt bad about leaving their baby over christmas because it could possibly be bad for him they ignore him and put it in anyways bad choice but they didnt know any better camuti is a cruel cruel man ! 
don t choose this book if currently in a life crisis an extremely convoluted read another reader mentioned dizzying and i concur chock full of psyco babble and others personal stories that i found uninspiring the numerous exercises myss requires of you to dissect past emotional events felt somehow unhealthy and too self absorbing how can one be objective about the dynamics of past painful events since our perspective of them can change dramatically with time the author s voice was to me that of a least favorite professor in college you know the one class you would nod off on occasion i took alot of effort for me to get through the first lengthy chapter which i did indeed fall asleep around page however the bottom line for me was the lack of joy in the authors words i found myss overcomplicating and over intellectualizing too many fundamental spiritual practicalities and principles this book would seem better off in general psychology and not in the selfhelpimprovement section of the bookstore the over analytical process could be enough to send someone in crisis over the edge 
lecarre deighton he isn t this was a very ordinary spy novel nothing outstanding and nothing that suspensful way too many coincidences and not enough reality such as a lecarre or deigton would have if this book were a movie it would be classified as bthis is the first littel book that i ve read some reviews stated that littel was in the genre of the great spy masters based on that info i purchased this one and one called the company well in the lexicon of howard cossell fugetaboutit he is a long long way from the masters 
are you kidding me this book is horrible i cant believe that i actually paid for this book anyone with a brain knows that if you buy low and sell high you will make money if you know that then you dont need this book this book is silly i cant believe that it was even printed 
voodoo physics gary zukav states in his introduction i had never studied physics in fact i didn t like science and i had no mathematical aptitude on opra tv he admitted that he does not have a tv which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth i noticed that some reviewers refer to the new physics is that like new age or voodoo physics of the matter must be missing from this book or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of he even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose many people say they did not understand physics until this book surprises you still do not you now know what zukav wished physics was take anti mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater and the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats at least get it straight before mixing it up try reading some of these the ascent of man by jacob bronowski the book available everywhere the dvd s available from the uk the upanishads by eknath easwaran editor michael n nagler photographeror just about any mainstream material on physics and religion then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner the tao of physics an exploration of the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism by fritjof capra also on the fringe but not as radical as zukav is a series called what the bleep both in books and on video 
terrible ! don t buy it the box looks like the calender is in color but it is black and white the jokes are not funny and the pictures are poor quality not only that the cats aren t doing anything bad like the calender suggests they are just regular house cat pictures doing practically nothing but sitting around with stupid captions below this calender i would not recommend i got it as a gift and was so disappointed i had to write a review right away to say don t buy it ! this suck 
not factual enough this book is a terrible book in my opinion and anyone who thinks that it is good needs to question their intelligence it is not based enough on facts and is full of personal perceptions opinions and myths of the author himself not recommended to anyone who is a music maker or true consumer quality music is expensive to create and very time consuming that is a fact that mr kusek fails to point out 
not very good i am laotion and wanted to be up to date on my language skills so i purchased this book a couple of years ago to expand my lao vocabulary i noticed that some of the words are wrong not just spelled wrong but are of a totally different subject ! also the diagram for the different lao tones at the beginning of the book are difficult and complicated to understand it s not clear on how to pronounce each tone for a language that is based on tones i think it s better just to buy a book w a cd rom so you can hear exactly how the tones are pronounced i was extremely disapointed w this book 
no maps but lots of oral history how can you write a book about the battle of the bulge and have no maps i knew when he said oral history there would be no detailed analysis of the battle 
do not buy this i would like to reiterate what s already been said the questions are not helpful and do not reflect the actual questions on the gre physics exam furthermore there are many typos and several of the answers they provide are incorrect overall this book is completely useless and i wish i had not purchased it 
not the great book people seem to think it is this is a book that could should have faded into history without being a great loss to the world yes there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy but they re far and few between and mainly either just thrown out as montesquieu s personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination or flimsily based on historical examples as a reader i didn t find most of his arguments where he didn t seem to be contradicting himself which happens frequently very convincing this was obviously written with the th century french salon crowd in mind and reads as such i m sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history he claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal well i did read the whole book and at the end couldn t see an overarching structure at all the work just seemed like a long rambling unorganized mess the only people i might really recommend this to are people interested in greek roman and french history especially legal history but not to people interested in political science or philosophy bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought there are much more interesting reads out there 
lacking insight if you re lookiing for valuable insight into how great businesses were conceived and executed this is not the book for you each business is given only a few pages of what essentially amounts to fluff most of the information is anecdotal in nature and rarely goes beyond the sort of superficial treatment one might get in people magazine the articles reminded me of something a high school student might turn in as a short essay assignment the roster of companies chosen is rather suspect there is disproportionate representation by the cosmetics and fashion industries i think that every company that sells makeup is covered here many of the other selections are some of the more glamorous and obvious success stories c mon we all know the microsoft story by now i was also puzzled by the lack of variety in the writing time and time again profit is referred to as turnover going public is referred to as floating a line of products is called a range was this book edited i cannot recommend this book for business persons it may be appropriate for a young person who has not been exposed to these canned legends before 
you can t trust relatives karen was a girl who had been to no exotic places so when her so called quotcousinquot blanch nvites her to england saying her dad gave permission karen is extremely happy the story is sizzling and exciting the plot is unique the escape is strategically planned i was kept in suspense till the last page 
boring i know it s difficult to discuss and review all of europe in one book but this book was boring it was easy to read but not very fun or interesting it did hit the highlights of the major sights but it acts more like a reference than an exciting guide 
not science fiction boring couldn t get through it robert a heinlein a leading writer of science fiction wrote a handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read realistic speculation about possible future events based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world past and present and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method in stranger in a strange land we re introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on mars these powers as of page are not explained there is hardly any conflict in story and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort during negotiations smith s lawyer steamrolls the opposition most of the prose is spent on the author s pontification at this point i m cutting my losses and shelving the book i m going back to asimov to read some real sf 
too mushy it makes peter horry and francis marion to mushy i wanted the fighting side not the staring into each others eyes and appearing to fall in love scenero peter horry was not pleased with it and told the rev to do what he wished with it and it was printed this could have been addedlater but for the beginning it turned me off 
description is misleading the amazon description says vol boxed set hardcover that is all true what they don t tell you is that there are actually six volumes the box in which it comes is clearly marked volumes of six that would have been a much better description for amazon to have used if you have volumes and you are looking to complete the set this book is for you if you are looking for the complete set look elsewhere 
an odyssey into dodgy cultural analysis this is simply one of the worst books on horror i ve ever read before you purchase this book know what you are getting the first half of the book focuses on the horror films of the twenties and thirties and is embroiled as would be expected with anecdotes stories and information about people like james whale tod browning and bela lugosi this is all highly interesting but unfortunately the author makes some very far reaching conclusions about the cultural place of horror films in the s and especially about frankenstein and dracula the two subjects to which he devotes the most time in the second half the book starts collapsing under the weight of its own grand conclusions and impossible correlations gradually almost unnoticeably facts and figures are entirely replaced with dodgy social and cultural analysis mr skal completely fails to mention jesus franco ruggero deodato lucio fulci and other famous italian horror directors hammer horror has less than a page devoted to it roger corman is mentioned in passing in a rambling two page essay about masque of the red death even dario argento who should be known to all but the least knowledgeable cinephiles is not mentioned at all in this book instead skal spends pages discussing aids vampirism and anne rice the author reaches conclusions that are drawn from a set of banal connections for instance in the chapter bad blood michael jackson is made out to be a modern day lon chaney the connection that both practiced physical transformation jackson is a pop star with plastic surgery lon chaney was a make up pioneer film star the connection is superficial at best horror icons are constantly made out to be christ figures this book is full of holes when it comes to the subject it s supposed to be a comprehensive study of italian spanish horror indian horror and asian horror are not mentioned at all and neither is the vhs revolution in the s to add to insult the cultural analysis is weak and contrived delivered in hyper eloquent grandiose prose and takes up about half of the book go with steven j schneiders the horror film and psychoanalysis freud s worst nightmares instead which covers much of the same subjects in an infinitely better package 
good but not great i ve been taking an intensive german translation course this summer and because i haven t taken any german before this i didn t have any vocabulary coming into it i bought this book as a supplement because i wanted to have as many resources as possible to get through class my problem with it has been that most of the verbs i ve tried to look up haven t been in it i ve only found a few of the verbs i ve tried to look up part of this however has to do with the compound nature of german and another part has to do with the fact that really isn t that many verbs in the grand scheme of linguistics if you re learning german for fun or to travel this book would probably be pretty helpful but if you re learning the language for academics or for a field of work with a specialized vocabulary you won t find everything you need in it 
whyohwhy for a teach yourself c book this book has very little actual code in it it should be called teach yourself structure and math of c because that s about all you re getting reading the other reviews i see everyone is having the same problem i am the author rarely includes sample code never really shows you how to create a program just kind of rambles on about structure and function not a good starter book at all 
readalbe but junky timeline is equivalent to a cent taco it s an indulgent bit of junk food timeline starts with a hillerman esque scientist turning up in the middle of new mexico an intriguing idea but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters there are so many preposterous story elements that it s just really difficult to take seriously the story is ever predictable and ludicrous but a cent taco is worth the effort if you re real hungry go back and read andromeda strain 
an underachievement not very good scholarship i settled down to read this book hoping i would find a stimulating rejoinder to richard noll s work and was disappointed if this is the best critique of noll that the jungians can muster then the jungian community is in deep deep trouble shamdasani detests noll and that is the only fact one learns after reading this short book i wasted my money buying it i would urge others to pass on this one and wait for more sophistated works of jung criticism to appear 
buyer beware i am a man with did and i found this book insulting to those who truly suffer from its effects the book was written with an attempt to read like a novel the author obviously fills in many trivial events with specluations since the mr west was not co conscious for much of the book he fills in the missing details with fluff and extremely poor writing the book is easy to read since it was written on a th grade level my eleven year old could easily sit down and read this the constant swearing and profanity left me baffled as to why the author decided to insert offensive language it didn t further the plot or define himself if it was an attempt to show the reader that he was a tough guy dealing with did it missed the mark since he spends most of the book refusing to take any responsibility for his actions his family and his diagnosis of did the author spends most of his energy attempting to create a gripping story around his did which falls flat in many of its pages not only are his sessions not realistic but he paints his did as debilitating deciding that he cannot work or take care of his family or even his young son the wife decides to work and puts the son in day care so that the father does not have to do anything but lay around with a blanket and toys and moan in truth people with did get up in the morning dress go to work make dinner help with homework fix the plumbing etc this is not an accurate portrayal of someone with did life with did is hard and devastating but did is not an excuse to quit life instead all of life s responsibilities actually helps the person with did to be in the present i found the therapy techniques in this book more consistent with did therapy than in fractured mind however mr west was not able to find a therapist who gave him the dose of reality that he needed until the last few chapters the first therapist never encouraged mr west to be present or taught him the skills he needed to be present and function as an adult this obviously gave mr west the green light to whine and whimper through most of the book at the end of the book i became very concerned about mr west entering the field of psychology and leading others down the his distorted path of healing in short i find the book poorly written with a great amount of offensive language a contrived storyline with an abundance of holes and an inaccurate portayal of someone who struggles with did i am concerned that readers of this book will assume that there is important information within the pages that will help them it will only assist the reader in becoming more confused about the disorder the dissociative identity disorder source book is still the best book that will help anyone learn about what did is and how to deal with it energies should be spent reading viable material that will explain teach and help those with did and their support please do not get sucked in by the media hype and the over effulgent swooning of others who obviously have dealt very little with did for respect of those who daily brave the storm of did do not buy this book you ve been warned 
grappling for a christian niche in philosophy grenz initially usurps postmodernity as a tool to echo the death of modernism it seems his primary purpose in this task is the conflict between modern thought and christianity s feasibility once he feels he s accomplished this he goes back and asks us to in certain instances ignore the triumph of the postmodern over the modern he s just outlined that we may embrace those few elements of modernity that may prove useful in allowing his yearning for christian legitimacy to continue with the least amount of resistance then he audaciously asks us to simultaneously ignore the nuances of postmodern thought that don t fit particularly well with christianity if you are used to picking favorable parts out of texts to support your position and blatantly ignoring all points to the contrary this book may be for you it appears that grenz is adeptly applying the traditional christian technique of selectively quoting bible passages out of context without regard for the overall message to his analysis of the modern and postmodern fortunately we don t need to perform any act of deconstruction on this text as the deconstruction is always already inherent in the text 
dreadful mishmash i have to say i truly hated this book the premise sounded interesting so i decided to give it a try i ve read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky this time i found her usual friends and co workers to be boring and self involved caricatures the groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way the constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows this is my last cromwell 
quasi science at best this book is awful it is full of speculations and just bad science i am going to quote one egregious example the comments in brackets are mine like the brain the human eye also evolved opposite really but complementary functions each human eye is a perfect mirror image of the other yet within the each retina there resides two functionally different types of cells with elegant symmetry the contrasting functions of the rods and cones correspond to the division of tasks between the right and left brain that is quite a comparison rods named for their cylindrical shape are extremely light sensitive distributed evenly throught the periphery of each retina they see in dim light and appreciate the rods have feelings the totality of the visual field seeing images as gestalts rods share with the right brain the ability to perceive the rods can think reality all atonce as opposed to what a little bit at a time cones in contrast congregate densely in a small spot in the central part of the retina cones have two attributes they appreciate there he goes again color and intensify clarity whatever that means concentrating on one aspect of reality at a time huh cones view the visual field as if through a tunnel actually cones and rods sense light together at the same time and your brain integrates and intreprets all that information into a perceived image but the most fantastic statement is the last sentance of this quote like rods cones report to both hemispheres but the left is metaphorically best suited to process their input that is such an absurd statement that shlain gives a footnote right on the same page contradicting his non sequitor and so it goes on for page after page of drivel i finally gave up after chapters a lot of reviewers find this book to be thought provoking i think it is a sad state that our appreciation of science is so dim that people can actually find this nonsense to be of interest 
yuch one of the worst i m am writing this from palawan in the philippines where a friend arrived a few days ago somewhat confused with this guide in hand i have lived in the philippines and traveled here extensively and have used the other guidebooks this one well sucks imho several issues firstly the book is unbearably surly it s tiring conscientious criticism is ok but we re here to enjoy our trip ok if the authors hate the philippines so much they should not be writing a guidebook strange how this british publication seems so bent on trashing our american colony secondly the travel information is just plain unreliable we tried to use the book s step by step travel information but many times found that the details were lacking intermediate travel steps were sometimes not there at all confusion ! distances noted seem to be right out of the twilight zone how three cities significantly farther along the same route can all be the same distance from manila is a mystery to me beyond that many of the most desireable and prominent tourist destinations just are not listed at all palawan is a prime example there s not that much here and the excellent butterfly farm is not listed actually virtually nothing is and true to form they mention the ones they do only as an excuse to gripe about them even the most beautiful seedy aspects of some of the philippines are not mentioned or glossed over this is unfortunate there are many resort areas that are basically brothel towns which is not pointed out in the narrative someone heading to these on a family vacation would be sorely disappointed in regards to these resort areas it s like writing a guide about las vegas and not mentioning gambling people need to know what s there so they can avoid it if nothing else i am also surpised and i found this in the rg for thailand recently as well important phone numbers are often not listed several times a filipino had offered to help us call a hotel or bus station and hoped to get the numner from our copy of of rg to no avail seems they had gotten the number from lp before and assumed this guide book would list them as well did i mention the guide is just plain mean spiritedthey also do not seem to know their audience i see the lonely planet crowd as budget travellers with some sense of travel conscience yet the guide exclusively recommends a very expensive handicrafts market in manila that is known for exploiting local artists there are numerous small shops that are reasonably priced that support local artisans which don t seem to exist for the rough guide folks neiman marcus seems to be the preferred mode i find little about this book to like i have liked other rough guides but for me this one well don t bother 
one of the most deceptive books ever written there is no measure how harmful and disastrous this sermon has been to all who have read or heard it the teaching of hell or everlasting damnation eternal torment is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of christianity over years ago the first century church never believed in a hell the theory of hell was brought in by converts to christianity from pagan religions of the world hell was embraced by the political religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and converting effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as orthodox centuries after the resurrection of christ our english translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact when it is actually fiction mostly all english versions except the concordant literal new testament and young s literal propagate this fallacy do your homework go to www dot what thehellishell dot com and www dot bible truths dot com and read up if you scoff then here is your challenge do the research from a non traditional non pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise god about other highly recommended books are the inescapable love of god by thomas talbott isbn not on amazon you must google it the origin and history of the doctrine of endless punishment by thomas thayer the bible hell by dr john wesley hanson go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what hell is and where it came from you will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out all those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on to you i say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of god that it creates that is hell indeed and that is the only hell that exists 
not impressed the authors seemed to spend more time asking you if you really really really want to get a poodle considering all the work and money they take than on giving valuable information not very helpful to those of us who already have a poodle and want to learn more about our dog puppy and caring for them it does have chapters on care and grooming etc but for the first several chapters it seemed to be cautioning people away from getting a poodle at least that was the impression i had 
one small man one giant book about him if the demon is in the details then james r hanson s first man has slain every demon in sight the real tragedy is that after pages we re left with a comprehensive timeline of neil armstrong s life but with little insight as to the inner workings of the man himself indeed as the commander of the apollo moon landing mission crewed by the amiable strangers of armstrong buzz aldrin and michael collins it was ironic that the closemouthed enigmatic armstrong was chosen to make he first step onto another planet of the three he proves to be the least interesting the ambitious aldrin schemes and works the backchannels of nasa management trying to be the first down the ladder while the cheerful irreverent collins methodically goes about his business of flying the command module while his crewmates make the landing collins is also an author and his carrying the fire is a much better account of the mission than hanson provides here despite reams of information and hundreds of interviews hanson chooses to let armstrong provide much of the commentary which proves to be a mistake to the end armstrong remains the quintessential engineer letting the data speak for itself and offering only the most guarded of opinions it s clear that his fellow astronauts have opinions of their own and when hanson allows them to dish the picture of armstrong becomes more complex indeed the book would have been far more interesting with more colleague sound bites and less armstrong throughout armstrong s nasa career his managers and finally hanson himself use him as a movie screen to project their own visions of mom apple pie and the dream of beating those lousy commies to the moon they hold him up as the symbol of america they want him to be rather than the engineering near savant he seems to become all but cut off from any emotions of his own armstrong s divorce from his wife of years is brushed aside in three pages the fact that he supposedly didn t carry anything to the moon and back for his wife and kids is passed off in a remark one could be forgiven after reading this book for believing that there was no room in the space progam for colorful astronauts however the careers of the late extroverted noisy pete conrad two gemini missions apollo landing and skylab or motormouthed captain america gene cernan gemini apollo commander would indicate otherwise after the moon mission it was aldrin and collins who took interesting steps of their own collins wrote worked in the state department and later managed the opening of the wonderful smithsonian air and space museum aldrin crushed by his second guy on the moon status battled depression and alcoholism before emerging healthy and sober as a vocal advocate of our continued presence in space and armstrong he became a near recluse but not before briefly becoming a professor of engineering at the university of cincinnati roughly the equivalent of tiger woods taking a job as the resident pro at a public golf course in fargo rather than boost the space program which afforded him a place in history an achievement paid for by you and me he refused to pimp opting instead to delve further into himself through sheer volume of details hanson masks the fact that this hagiography is neither an enlightening nor satisfying look at the man who forever changed interplanetary travel those old enough will always remember where they were the moment armstrong set foot on the moon and blew his line it was supposed to be one small step for a man but you ll never discover the human being within the moonsuit from this weighty tome 
not for everybody if you are looking for a book where you can read and enjoy the stories this is not for you the way it is written is so difficult to understand and there is no continuos flow in the book which will make you so bored that you just want to stop reading 
nice but i expected more this is a nice book but not a good buy at about ! nice pictures that you might look at again sometime in the future but not much info if you want a reference for yoga what is needed in the yoga community is a book like strength training anatomy by frederic delavier at about this is the book to have in your collection detailing yoga asanas that work the various muscle groups 
biblical fiction this book is not really a commentary but an explanation of tim lahaye s view of the end times which is not thorough and leaves tons of holes the whole rapture movement is based on almost no biblical grounds but is popular just because it makes for exciting books for a thorough well researched understandable and biblically sound commentary on revelation pick up herman hoeksema s outstanding work behold he cometh ! 
unbiblical and bad writing make for one star this book is so flawed in every which way it is hard to know where to begin first of all we are living in the end times and when jesus comes that s all she wrote folks there s no seven years no christians being zapped up etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true then what s the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to and then when people zap out of thin air change your life it s ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really don t think the author s care at this point seeing how many millions they ve made printing lies my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you ll get truth and the bible is probably shorter and much better writing man not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck 
pass on this one it s not just algebra there is some statistics also for the most part not well layed out i would pass on this one 
thoroughly disappointing watch the mini series skip the book if you are a fan of history and i m certain you are if you re reading this review skip this book read rick atkinson or dick winters account anything just skip this book the writing was high school quality a poor job by the editors apparently the atomic bomb was dripped on hiroshima and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting enjoy the mini series but if you re interested in this topic find another book 
where are the flags and sound effects i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in then it was a mere idea from that time on until august th i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title let freedom ring with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover patriot that he is but also a flag i loved it couldn t be more happy well the day of the book s release i took a day off work ive never missed a day of work before in my life and rushed to get this book it looked better than i ever imagined with the flag on the cover and the title of let freedom ring i thought finally technology has caught up to our patriotism i expected a book filled with flags flags with sound effects maybe some firework sound effects boy was i wrong i opened the book only to the colors black and white no red no blue no stars and stripes i quickly turned the pages looking searching for flags i found none no sound effects either no fireworks at that point i went into a year long depression i nearly committed suicide at several points it s only now that i can bring myself to review this man s book patriot that he is i say this so you know what you re getting yourself into there are no flags no stars and stripes no fireworks no sound effects i have since recovered but only because of old stars and stripes i went back to teaching last year not fully recovered and my colleagues knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes suggested i have my class do a research project find the most patriotic book ever made the methodoloy was simple a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest we found some very good books and they did cheer me up the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called president jesus how jesus wrote the constitution freed the slaves and won world war ii its published by a small church in texas i was very proud of my students for finding it it has brought countless joy to my life along with the book made entirely out of a flag with flag pictures and written in blue and red ink you get a giant flag i m not sure of the dimensions but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck i ve draped it over my house and it covers it completely people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time smiling 
if i could give it no stars i would maybe i m not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book but i have read the likes of jane austen and louisa may alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review please please don t put yourself through the torment of reading this book it is probably the worst book i have ever read it goes on and on about the littlest of details which don t have anything to do with the book i read this when i was and it is safe to say i wasn t too immature to read it everyone in my class read it and i m pretty sure we all had the same opinions it really sucked i would tell you the worst part of the book but that would ruin the story but let me just tell you a little tip don t read it don t read it don t read it don t read it i tried to read it again last year and i couldn t put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book don t waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing 
good start but tthe rest was bad i was very disappointed with this book there were some good reviews but i found that the story could not deliver it started off good a good murder mystery i was excited to see what would unfold i kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened the whole book was to me a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
the mystical magical wonderful book the book was about a girl named jennifer and a toad that she bought from a magic shop for a school project about pets the only thing she did not know about the toad was that the toad bufo could talk i would recomend this book to people who like fairy tales or books with magic the characters in this story are jennifer ellen mr elives sharra skippy brandon mrsmurdley and bufo the toad my opinion of this story was that it was not so good but ok i thought the book was boring 
the japanese mind as a westerner interpetes it i read this book because my husband is a professor of intercultural communication and management i am from the city where the material was gathered after reading these entertaining stories i found myself asking questions to my husband and friends as to why do the japanese not know how to explain their own culture but i then thought that japanese culture is too complicated as any other country and japanese culture is rapidly changing even more so with the younger generation for this out dated material the essays are university assignments from as old as seven years ago to be applicable it might be important to keep in mind that this book offers some very general opinions of how one british professor interpreted japanese culture as experienced by students who had to write an english assignment for a esl lecture my friends and i never thought that much about our work when we wrote it it was school work only however it may be especially helpful for someone who understands only the basics of japanese stereotypes while the essays on values such as giri amae etc are pointing at key values i think they might continue further talks and scattered or old views of japanese young people 
entertaing thought provoking but kind of silly the future of war predicts us dominance of warfare throughout the st century as a result of us advanced technology in general and precision weaponry in particular their train of thought has considerable merit and deserves reading and thoughtful attention however the book suffers from the same two major flaws as most books by visionaries without enough practical experience misunderstanding of specific happenings in the past and unlikely projections into the far future having been involved with us defense for years as a member of the military as a designer and developer and advisor on us weaponry and as an advisor on strategic operational and tactical issues i read this book with considerable amusement although i do take seriously much of what it says i shall give specifics on two failures to understand the details of the past and then offer criticism of two of the book s projections as examples past episode the precision strikes against iraq there is no doubt that our air strikes and land attacks in the campaign to liberate kuwait were exceedingly effective and there is no doubt that this effectiveness was largely due to our precision weaponry however to do precision strikes whether with airborne munitions or ground forces it s necessary to know what targets to attack where they are and what weapons are likely to be effective against a particular target in the campaign this effort was undertaken by the jeddi knights largely under the guidance of col john warden the key role of the jeddi knights was to establish priorities and mission profiles for which targets to strike when with what munitions and they did this extraordinarily well what the friedmans obviously don t know is the amount of detailed information that was available to the jeddi knights carefully acquired over the years preceding the campaign first by the british until about and thereafter by the us military the armed forces of major powers assume they may have to fight wars on short notice aganst opponents who have been designated shortly before by national authorities so they invest a great deal in gathering information pertinent to how various campaigns might be conducted in the case of iraq the british did very careful mapping from until about producing ordnance maps of higher detail and accuracy than exist even for some parts of the united states and these were invaluable to planners then starting in about when it began to seem possible that the us might someday have to fight somewhere in the middle east the us military carefully gathered information relevant to how a campaign might be fought and which potential enemy targets should be candidates for destruction these studies resided in us intelligence and military archives until the iraqi invasion of kuwait and were then used as the basis for planning the campaign two examples of this first the destruction of certain bridges was given high priority not to impede vehicular movement but to sever the communications cables running under the bridges our planners knew which cables important to iraqi command and control were buried too deeply to destroy easily except where they were routed under bridges and therefore which bridges to take out to disrupt iraqi military communications second the swing by us british and french forces far to the west the hail mary gambit would not have been possible in that harsh terrain unless viable routes for armor and supply vehicles were known and the iraqi army either didn t know of such routes or didn t believe we could know of them there are exactly two feasible routes and both were used they can both be determined in complete detail from careful study of the british ordnance maps prepared in the s and although i wasn t involved in the campaign planning i had no difficulty in finding and plotting the only two feasible routes before the ground campaign began from the good maps in my possession i also understand why it was necessary to bring the two prototype jstars systems to the theatre to detect and allow blocking of any iraqi strike intended to sever the tapline road this was also evident from the maps by contrast we had no success at all in locating and destroying mobile scud missile launchers because they moved around with great frequency if you don t know where something is no precision of your weaponry and no amount of technical sophistication or military skill will allow you to destroy it past example the safeguard bmd system the friedmans say on the basis of assertions by people who may or may not be experts that safeguard was deactivated because it wouldn t work in fact the situation was exactly the reverse but one must know the purpose of safeguard and its mode of operation to understand what actually happened the mission of safeguard was to prevent complete success of a soviet counterforce first strike against our minuteman icbm fields by opening a launch window for a retaliatory strike by the minuteman missiles in the face of a full scale soviet strike i helped to plan and design that system and it would have done what it was intended to although at a horrible increased toll of death and destruction which i dreaded but could see no alternative to in the face of rapidly increasing soviet capability far more important than the fact that we knew safeguard would work was the fact that the soviets concluded it would work that realization brought them back to the bargainng table at the helsinki talks and led to the salt i treaty which i rejoiced about provisions of that treaty made safeguard unnecessary and that s why the one completed safeguard site was deactivated and construction on the other sites was stopped also on the subject of balistic missile defense the friedmans assert that midcourse discrimination and destruction of incoming warheads is infeasible this is simply not true although there is an exceedingly serious problem associated with doing it i know three quite different ways of doing midcourse discrimintion and destruction of enemy incoming warheads and given that i ve been out of that business for more than years i expect that other ways are known by now the problem is that at least for the three ways i know one is politically unacceptable to the us congress and the us public one is so expensive that it s unlikely congress would ever fund it and the third if fully developed would be usable for certain other military purposes that would probably lead to a renewed arms race as our potential major opponents sought to counter it i was one of a small group of scientists who successfully recommended to congress that development of that third approach be stopped to avoid the resulting foreseeable escalation scientists and military professionals despite various comments in the friedmans book work closely together over years and decades and come to have considerable knowledge of each other s fields whether at some future time it may become desirable to develop and deploy a bmd system that does midcourse discrimination and destruction of warheads is a political and diplomatic question to be decided by the public and its elected leaders on which i have no insight but it is technically feasible now turning to the future what the friedmans fail to understand in their glowing vision of us technology dominating future warfare is that for every technical advance opponents can devise at least partial countermeasures and that therefore no amount of technology as such can determine the outcome of a campaign the coalition conquest of iraq in provides an excellent example although large parts of the iraqi army and all of its top leadership was utterly incompetent other large parts of the iraqi army were composed of thoroughly trained officers and enlisted men who fully understood that if they confronted us forces nose to nose they would be destroyed understanding this very many of the best iraqi units simply demobilized themsleves and disappeared into the civilian population as coalition forces approached in many cases taking their weaponry with them one entire iraqi division near the border with iran totally vanished before we got to its bases everyone from the division commander to the most junior private professional soldiers even if motivated to fight have no more desire than anyone else to be killed pointlessly in a situation where they are unable to resist effectively a substantial fraction of these well trained motivated iraqi forces subsequently emerged as part of the resistance movement that continues in iraq how many of the resistance fighters come from that crowd is obviously impossible to know for sure but my personal estimate is that about of saddam hussein s best and most loyal troops and officers became part of the resistance movement and our overwhelming superiority in all aspects of conventional warfare have been far less effective against current iraqi resistance methods the resistance movement seems to be gradually weakening and fragmenting but it s a long slow process in which our precision weapons and our advanced communications and intelligence give us far less of an advantage than they do in conventional warfare there are various other gaps in the friedmans assessment of the future i ll mention only two of many first vircators often touted as the most effective weapon of the st century have had only relatively diappointing results so far why partly because technical improvements to vircators are needed those will surely come along in due course much more serious is the fact that battle damage asssessment after a vircator strike is at present almost impossible to do with any degree of accuracy so after a target has been attacked with one or more vircators there is no practical way to know whether the strike was successful or not presumably some day we will overcome this particular problem but it illustrates that new and potentially formidable technology may find relatively little application because of purely tactical and operational problems that arise in using it as my second example i ll remark on the friedmans vision of us infantrymen as being in effect cocooned in future to protect them from the enemy s weapons this vision ignores two serious problems first no cocoon imaginable can protect an infantryman against certain weapons such as a fuel air bomb if the enemy knows approximately where the infantryman is second and closely related anyone with substantial experience in concealing himself in a hostile environment including me knows all too well that the more accoutrements one has the harder it is to hide and not be observed in light clothing and carrying only light personal weapons i can disappear into the landscape almost anywhere and move around unnoticed burdened with excess equipment and elaborate protective clothing only certain carefully selected spots can offer concealment everyone with experience in this matter knows as much as i do on this subject so infantrymen whose lives depend on not being observed will move far more cautiously when heavily burdened than when lightly armed and lightly protected that doesn t mean infantry should be sent into combat inadequately equipped but it does mean that the increased effectiveness of some given number of trained infantry when provided with extra combat capability and protective equipment is far less than one might otherwise suppose i could cite dozens of other matters past and projected which the friedmans book misunderstands or overlook but this is enough i ll just say that the book is an excellent source of ideas but should be viewed with practiced skepticism 
a tale the novel a tale of two cities by charles dickens is a story of love and compassion which takes place during the beginnings of the french revolution despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for dickens writing style throughout the novel dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes the language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on the character of lucie manette is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws her character is the supposed epitome for women but in truth is highly improbable throughout the novel dickens does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue despite these countless imperfections dickens does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution the book with all its shortcomings did reveal to the reader the atrocities that occurred during the french revolution and the events that led to it the abuse of the nobles and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel the one other aspect that dickens got right in his novel was the character of sydney carton sydney carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what carton feels carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life this characteristic is common among people and dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely the novel a tale of two cities is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often dickens overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book s dryness however dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy this is a book for a reader who likes dickens overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories 
on the problem of anti catholicism professor jenkins has written with insight and clarity on a number of controversial topics unfortunately while this book raises some important points it is rather tendentious compared to his past works at one point he claims that the clinton administration s health security initiative failed to make it into law because of the administration s petty aversion to having the catholic church as an ally this strange assertion will come as news to many including theda skocpol author of the most comprehensive study on the failure of the clinton health care proposal elsewhere professor jenkins explores the pedigree of anti catholic prejudice in america in depth but he fails to do the same for vatican hostility to the united states which has a long pedigree of its own despite the good feelings towards the catholic church in the united states at independence due in part to french aid against the british and the disestablishment of protestant churches the vatican regarded the u s as the bastard brat of jacobinism to quote samuel eliot morison and warned against the heresy of americanism this hostility persisted right up until the papacy of john xxiii also during the th century the vatican made no bones about its opposition to freedom of religion freedom of thought and freedom of conscience this hostility persisted right up until the second vatican council unfortunately while none of the vatican ii reforms have been formally rescinded during the papacy of john paul ii they now seem to be as much a dead letter as the splendid list of rights embalmed in the old soviet constitution nevertheless it is deplorable that roman catholics have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in actions this book indisputably documents such treatment deserves condemnation wherever it occurs it reveals a kind of disregard for others that endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society but the proper reaction to outrages committed against catholics should not be to claim that all who take a critical view of the church are motivated by prejudice there is an immense and inordinate effort by the vatican in some countries eg poland italy the united states to manipulate civil statutes and to have its doctrines written into the secular law even when the vatican s efforts may seriously threaten the lives and well being of a large number of people as in attempts to hamstring public health efforts against sexually transmitted disease its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved although the authoritarian inclination of the church is not a crime it is a more or less strong tendency ordered towards clericalism and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective threat to a democratic polity when the church seeks to illegitimately extend its power in democratic societies or when civil legislation is introduced to confer privileges to which no one denomination has any conceivable right neither the vatican nor professor jenkins should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and irrational and violent reactions increase therefore special concern and attention should be directed toward those who have this inclination lest they be led to believe that the subversion of the u s constitution is a morally acceptable option it is not with all this in mind decent catholics should ask their bishops to be especially cautious of any programs that may seek to pressure american law and society to abrogate the rights of any citizens even while claiming not to do so a careful examination of the public statements and the activities conservative catholic pressure groups promote reveals a blatant duplicity by which they attempt to mislead catholics and the general public alike for example they may present the teaching of the magisterium as if it were the mandatory source for all secular laws its specific authority is held to be binding on the entire society some of these groups will use the word democratic to describe either the organization or its intended actions yet they do not defend and promote the interests of american society indeed they even openly attack it those within the church who argue in this fashion often have close ties with those with similar views outside it these latter groups are guided by a vision bitterly opposed to american liberty and pluralism they reflect even if not entirely consciously a sacral state ideology that denies the democratic nature of the united states as well as the rights of every individual this does not mean that conservative catholics are not generous and giving of themselves on occasion but when they engage in seditious activity against fellow citizens they confirm within themselves a disordered political inclination that is essentially self indulgentjesus promised you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free jn conservative catholics including the hierarchy here and in the vatican should have the truth about american society and its secular democratic culture clearly explained to them so they will stop denigrating it so incessantly after all without the defeat of nazism and u s opposition to soviet communism the young karol wojtyla might well have been shot in a secret police cellar instead of going on to become pontiff there has never been a society in human history that afforded so many catholics included the opportunity to practice their religion so freely as the united states however catholics must be trustworthy custodians of other s freedoms as well as their own perhaps professor jenkins s next book can take up this challenge 
bias baloney and balderdash astonishing to see amazon promoting this anti israel anti semitic book from an organisation that prides itself on just those prejudices this book skews history totally ignoring the yes times when the arabs could have got themselves another palestinian state ignoring the fact that jordan already occupies rds of the original area of mandate palestine allocated for a jewish homeland by the league of nations in 
outdated don t waste your money i bought this book for last minute prep for my exam and i foundout it is nothing like the real exam it doesn t really give you a feel for the real exam there are other exam preps material out there that gives you more of a feel for the real exam than this book 
good book for someone who only likes to read i buy most programming books with the expectation that there will be some step by step modules geared toward developing some type of application i found nothing of the sort in this book i found a lot of code to demonstrate what the author was saying i felt the whole book was geared toward the history and explanation of what various programming components were all about i am an accomplished asp web database developer and was interested in learning how to write activex components i thank the author for wasting my money 
unfulfilled promise the premise of the store is interesting how did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football the first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons west coast offense lt etc unfortunately at that point lewis runs out of things to write about so he starts talking about michael oher an o lineman at ole miss oher s story is intersting but it is too early to tell he is a superstar but only a sophomore i also think that lewis overdoes how great oher already is i also don t really understand what oher s story really had to do with the original premise of the book is lewis saying that because left tackles now make millions oher wants to be one i would think that if oher had come around in the s people would still have thought of him as a football player last time i checked lineman were big and strong and quick in that era too 
vapid i found this book incredibly boring while it is obvious that leddick gets into his characters i did not i found them two dimensional hollow cliches lacking in authenticity mr leddick should do more research and try to imbue his characters with more dimensions and distinct voices i would suggest that he write porn instead but even the sex scenes in the book are unrewarding unerotic and unarousing on the plus side the guy on the cover is quite tasty and fortunately legal someone should just put together a coffee table book of covers of gay novels i am sure that it would be more stimulating than a great deal of the novels themselves 
where s the gauge ever other knitting book magazinepattern etc has stressed the importance of knitting gauge unfortunately the patterns in this book don t even offer a gauge ! i knit the baby booties they came out absolutely adorable but were better suited for a barbie than a baby they were sooo tiny ! i changed to needles two sizes larger and still ended up with bitty baby booties without a knitting gauge it is really hard to tell if you should change yarn needles or if you are knitting too tight or loose i also agree with the other readers who commented on the lack of photos why would i spend hours and hours on a project with no idea of what it should even look like imagine spending two months on a sweater that you absolutely hate ! there are sooo many other knitting books out there for beginners skip this one and get stitch n bitch or debbie bliss how to knit

paranoid and unhelpful should you be afraid of your microwave oven this book discusses that non issue for several paragraphs before concluding that no you probably shouldn t be afraid of your microwave that embodies what s wrong with this book it pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas it also assumes that you the reader are the mother tobe while having very little to say to your partner in a way that i find subtly sexist overall it has plenty to make you extra worried for instance it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house on the door in the kitchen on the bathroom mirror really all around your house in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet as if the bump in your belly wasn t already making you worry quite enough if you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front door to ask you daily have you fed your baby breakfast today then you may like this book personally i found that what to expext left me alarmed about microwaves air pollution ambient noise even exercise in ways that were not helpful for a book so full of information it also curiously failed to address any of my specific questions how soon should i begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins as soon as i start trying to get pregnant or only after the pregnancy test comes back positive is there anything i can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant what are those odds anyway for a woman my age these seemed like reasonable questions to me but to find answers i had to look in the far morehelpful book by ann douglas the mother of all pregnancy books which also features a nifty week byweek what shappeninginsideyourbody chart that i love the other book i highly recommend is armin brott s the expectant father which has terrific reasonable advice you won t find elsewhere by those two not this one 
painful to read i have enjoyed baldacci s work before but this book was simply awful i couldn t believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible i was very surprised to get such stilted writing from baldacci you can miss this one in my opinion 
basically improper if you have had little or no exposure to north american culture or media this book would provide you with all of the fundamentals of the upper class beyond that lisa johnson s advice seems largely based upon common sense or on how to not be lower class very little useful specific information is given i also disliked the author s approach to meeting people in the unlikely event that one does see a millionaire in the it s just not the sort of place that one socializes and properly meets people yet that s just the sort of thing that is suggested by the author the general lack of propriety in her methods is what makes this book poor instruction unless you really need the basics try ginie polo sayles s book for something a bit more useful 
blow the whale down what is this book about whale revenge what is that i read the whole book and all they do is ride around in a boat and there s a whale and they kill it this is basically moby dick for kids i m guessing the whale is the main character as none of the characters are memorable i don t fault the author but what editor allowed this book to sneak by i guess somebody who likes whales a real lot 
who wrote this surely not hillerman if tony hillerman wrote this novel novella actually i sure can t tell i have been a chee leaphorn fan for many years but this novel is not in the same league with hillerman s other work it is reminiscent of a b movie instead of building suspense the plot is laid out all too plainly the characters are unreal and the chee bernie romance doesn t ring true i am amazed that it was published 
an absolute travesty deliberately misleading i bought a copy of the report feeling that i ought to research the government s account of the events of that is of course exactly what i got questions so basic as why the air force couldn t prevent the first second and third crash or why the towers collapsed when no steel superstructure building ever fell as a result of fire in all of history before that day are left unasked and uninvestigated additionally there is no index a lot like the original warren report volumes detailing the events of jfk s assassination which is absolutely unforgivable for this type of book this report is to a large degree official subterfuge it answers no important questions and its recommendations are as ridiculous as they are ineffectual the us government purpose here was obviously to create an interpretation of the events of that neither hold anyone accountable nor suggest constructive anti terror policy this book angers me a great deal it should anger you too 
hated it i love the scarpetta books but i had to force myself to finish this one the plot was disjointed and the use of the english language was atrocious i can t believe she published this it is absolutely not up to par if you re going to waste your time on this book get it from a library so you don t waste your money as well 
the definition of trash trash sells and this is the definition of trash unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
not as good as quotthe collector quot and quotthe magus quot john fowles is a talented writer and i think that if you end up buying this book you will not be disappointed it has some interesting points in it many deep thoughts some interesting chapters but the problem is that i don t think that the story of quotdaniel martin quot is a good one it is not fascinating atleast it didn t raise my interest at some point i started to dislike this daniel martin he seemed boring and dull just like any stupid chauvinistic self centered egoistic middle aged man you can see maybe there is a point in describing a person like that but frankly i am not very thrilled to read about a man like that i think i ve met too many quotdaniel martins quot in real life 
deviance or brilliance mr irving is a renowned writer who has pleased readers with books like the world according to garp prayer for owen meany and cider house rules there is a creativity about his writing and a quirkiness in his characters that i find appealing what happened here i was so mired down in wordiness and child sexual abuse that my commitment to the book ended with the protagonist s early grade school sexual experiences if somebody walked into a person s home and found drawings of what was verbalized in the book they would probably consider the individual a pedophile and his home would be marked on public records as housing a pervert it seems strange that a brilliant writer could go on ad infinitum describing the same things in words and be considered worthy of praise anything the book had to offer was lost on me because i couldn t get past being inundated with pages and pages dedicated to pathetic images of a young boy s penis crude and rude abusive adolescent girls and body hair fetish maybe had i been pulled in enough to read further i would have found redeeming value in until i find you as it played out for me the book is not worthy of john irving 
this rorschach when a book that is so provably fictional as crow killer is praised repeatedly for being true and accurate the review says more about the values and fantasies of the reader than about the book crow killer is a vicious racist diatribe that perpetuates a comic book view of the fur trade johnson wasn t a mountain man he was one of the jackals who drifted in a generation later to pick the bones a buffalo slaughterer and a wolf killer and a racist among men who understood the indians better than most vardis fisher s mountain man has a good deal of racism in it but fisher manages to maintain a distance between his own values and those of the mountain men he gives the indians a chance to tell their own story and he tempers the cultural racism of the mountain men with their firsthand knowledge of the people around them jeremiah johnson goes even further in that direction and that for one thing is why i consider the redford pollack film the best of the three works the indians in fisher and redford s stories are real people with intelligence courage and a way of looking at the world that is different from ours but not inferior in crow killer indians are stupid vicious and look who s talking subhuman poisoning forty blackfeet warriors is you see a joke any real that is to say white man can kill them in handfuls get over it the mountain men were no more glamorous that hell s angels or that vicious little twerp billy the kid michael pollard folks not val kilmer kris kristoferson or paul newman they went west to get rich just like the grubby gold mad prospectors we don t idolize at annual reenactments they went west because they were too sociopathic to survive in civilized society and they admired the indians because they appeared to the outlaw white to be a lawless adulterous as chris lapp says people and libertarians like fisher worship them because they are so utterly self absorbed self important and free of society and romantic city boys their drawers damp with admiration called their manifestation of sociopathy freedom right like the freedom of meth lab enterpreneurs on their harley vibrators so if you enjoy racist humor and violence and you love perpetuating stereotypes about indians and you want to admire somebody who if he really were who you think he is would beat you to a pulp just for fun go for it but don t call it history ok it s no more history than hustler is gynecology 
almost everything dan brown taught us about christ is false books have been written and will continue to be written to try and disprove christianity and jesus as the son of god what is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people that s because you can t disprove the truth and what are some of the errors you ask i will give you a few dan brown tries to use gnostic gospels gospels written in the nd century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses to try and prove his theory and omitting new testament scripture to say that jesus and mary magdalene were married by using the gospel of phillip written after a d where there are missing words and the companion of the mary magdalene more than the disciples kiss her on her clearly there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over years after jesus died this does not prove anything also he says that the word companion means spouse in aramaic which is great except that the gospel of philip was written in coptic where companion does not mean spouse second dan brown says that it wasn t until ad at the council of nicea did people start to believe jesus was a deity and that it was a close vote new testament disproves that because it shows that jesus was deity where paul writes in corinthians for i delivered to you first of all that which i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen by cephas then by the twelve also the council of nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders all of whom believed that jesus was divine the main question was whether jesus was begotten or made jesus divinity death and resurrection were not in question only two of clerics at the council did not sign the nicene creed so there was not a close vote unless you think to is close ! third his main argument is that it mary magdalene in the last supper painting by leo if that were true then where is john the youngest and most beloved apostle john was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth as is seen in many stained glass portraits in european cathedrals and also leo was just a painter who was not around when jesus was so it didn t matter if he tried to put mary in a painting or not ! fourth brown says that the gnostic gospels and the dead sea scrolls are the earliest christian records while the new testament obviously came before the gnostic gospels the dead sea scrolls refer to a collection of about documents many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in hebrew greek and aramaic that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of jesus or of any other person mentioned in the new testament as they are jewish documents ! he also says they were discovered in the s when they were discovered in oops ! fifth dan brown says that christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of mithraism he says that mithraism worshipped the pre christian god mithras called the son of god and light of the world who was born on december th died was buried in a rock tomb and then resurrected in three days scholars of mithraism would strongly disagree with brown on all of these points nowhere is mithras given the title son of god and the light of the world brown apparently made this up because it sounded good mithras was born on december th however this proves nothing the new testament never associated december th with the birth of christ the early christians chose to celebrate the birth of christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan mid winter festival of saturnalia they never claimed jesus was actually born on that date the claim that mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true scholars will tell you that in mithraism there is no death of mithras at all so there was no rock tomb and no resurrection so once again he is nowhere near correct lastly brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over gospels first there were only less than half that many books written about jesus life the two gnostic gospels brown relies on most heavily weren t written until the second century a d long after the new testament gospels were written it makes sense that the gnostic gospels came about in the late second century as this is when gnostic thought was most prevalent however the new testament was complete before the end of the st century also the gospel of thomas which dan brown lies heavily on claims women must become men in order to receive salvation that makes no sense there are many other errors in this novel but i think i have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously this is pure or rather poor fiction without a shred of evidence that jesus was anything other than the christ the son of the living god ! thank you dan brown for making my faith stronger 
very inadaquate the text doesn t come close to describing any of the terrain rendering algorithms adequately for this the author refers the reader to whitepapers on the companion cd written by the original authors after a short search on the internet i turned up a wealth of better written descriptions on d terrain rendering algorithms i suggest others to do the same the author makes a big deal out of the importance of morphing vertex points to minimize the effect of popping but provides no implementation description as he says in the text i didn t want to limit your imagination what a cop out the c code provided on the companion cd is cleanly written compiled and ran without problems but is also clean of any useful comments further mystifying the subject another search on the internet turned up many source code examples with better documentation 
do not use for self study this book is not meant for self study this book is too theoretical and it does not give enough basic examples it is too abstract i do not recommend this book to anyone 
dissappointed how can you have a book about past new orleans and not mention shotgun houses a very bad decisio 
dullsville perhaps i d put too much stock in all the praise i d seen heaped on charles mccarry and this book what a great espionage writer he is the party line went our le carr etc etc but this book which i purchased at full price in hardcover was so dull and disappointing that i gave up in anger and disinterest not even half way through mccarry probably has been as good as his admirers say but in this book he seems to have switched on the auto pilot taken the money and run i quickly grew tired of all his fancy brand names dropped it appears as a way to suggest authenticity and insider knowledge and all the exotic locales he pushes his characters to as if scouting locations for a movie i have not given up i will now try his earlier books starting with tears of autumn and keep my fingers crossed i remain hopeful
