entertaining i found this story very entertaining a hard book to put down ! however there are points where you have to question if there is some fiction thrown in the story or weather queen is being completely truthful about his involvement in certain circumstances none the less it is a very entertaining read 
groundbreaking this is one of the few craps books that tells you how to chart the numbers and shows actual sessions people think the numbers are random but the author shows you how to take advantage of streaks by charting the trends

if you are only going to read one book on conservation and ecology this is it ! if you ever been frustrated by people who love nature but don t understand it then you will want to join harriet on her journey of misunderstanding written in the same witty style that we have come to love from larson this is a wildely entertaining childrens book that has me laughing and exclaiming amen at the same time the genius of this book is even recognized by harvard ecologist e o wilson author of the forward i bought a box of these to give out to all of my friends and family simply put it is my all time favorite book ! 
one of the best this is definitely the best book i read in a long time ayn rand s objectivism philosophy is fascinating to anyone that loves freedom capitalism and reason this is not a book that any closed minded socialist like thinker should read ie people that believe in increased federal government control over our lives this book rightfully criticizes the intellectuals of the th century that promoted socialist programs and even socialism itself ayn rand was a real thinker that reminded me of how great this country was and still could be if we return to what we were when this country was created by our democratic capitalist and intellectual founding fathers i am looking forward to the atlas shrugged movie that is in the making 
a lesson for children and adults alike i see plenty of people complaining about the cd but you are living in your generation by saying it is not as good i have only heard the new version and the children in my class love it they will one day remember this song with the same nostalgia as you do about the old one ! please don t give a wonderful multicultural book about unity a lower rating than it deserves because of this also regarding the person who refuses to read it to her kids because of the homosexual references the purpose of this book is to educate children to be tolerant of these facts ! if you protect your children from such facts you only add to the ignorance that later becomes non tolerance 
excellent effort looking forward to more although i think the secondary characters could use a little more attention the primary ones are well drawn and believable it s a well turned plot though i wish everyoine involved author editor and whoever wrote the jacket blurb would have been a little more circumspect with clues one reviewer complained of southern stereotyping i say barely i lived in the area for a couple of years and the description sounds eerily familiar to me i had an owner of an extensive marina complex tell me once i am the law on magnolia point geographical name changed just like taylor in the book out in the country the way things work is accurately described and sorry but people do use yall in the singular perhaps they shouldn t but they do in any case since there is now a sequel we know demarco survived i m looking forward to the next one 
read this book i sincerely wish that everyone would read quotquantum leaps quot if so there would be a quotquantum leap quot in individual and universal consciousness she explains new scientific technology in a clear and easily understandable way her examples and explanations are excellent and clearly point out the necessity for a change in consciousness from the old newtonian mechanistic to the world of today s quantum physics this book is simplistic enough to be read by someone unfamiliar with current technology and it is also able to captivate the mind and imagination most erudite warning pleased be advised that you may find yourself buying copies for your friends and stopping strangers on the street telling them to read this book 
great book on the power of long term friendship a great book on the power of lifetime friendships while the focus of the book was williams it was great learn more about dom dimaggio who lived in the shadow of his brother and williams

a really good introduction to international finance if the previous reviewer thought this was too complicated and confusing i don t know what they d make of the leading textbook in the field krugman s international economics which is a confusing disorganized and bloated mess in my opinion this book is much simpler clearer better organized and better written i just took a course with krugman s text and now i m reading this to figure out what the heck krugman was talking about with great success 
a thoroughly enjoyable treatment of a very complex subject i heartily agree with the editorial reviews written above hundert is a very good writer he has brought three crucial subjects of study together in a highly informative discussion that would benefit any worker in the mental health profession what i found most enlightening was his focus on avoidable mistakes by professional practioners the mistakes are easily corrected by basic philosophical analyses while it may be understandable that the book has gone out of print since professionals are rarely interested in having their mistakes pointed out to them i hope this gifted writing keeps writing

excellent detail and depth i found this book to be invaluable for learning physiology it was in depth and has excellent illustrations a must have for the physiology student 
great book from heinline s good period this is the story of a youth and his discovery of what his world is all about it is a similar to tunnel in the sky and time for the stars in style originally penned in s so it is in the author s best period as the other reviews have stated it covers a lost colony ship and the survivors it is not a long work but it is great if you like orphans of the sky you may want to read the world and thorinn by damon knight it is a similar concept and is also well done 
an exceptionally good find in doing research on life in the united states and events leading to world war ii i stumbled upon this book the details and the varied information in this book leaves me thinking that mr perrett s work is a marvelous achievement i was between and during world war ii and no work i have seen better covers these war years on the homefront 
insightful vivek ranadive s book says technology has changed the way business is conducted having seemingly stated the obvious though he tells you what this means this technology has spawned the event driven revolution a transforming shift in how corporations act the book begins with the early transformation of the financial services industry to an event driven business it goes on to discuss enterprise business applications and then the internet throughout the author addresses the differences between contemporary and event driven business models with great emphasis on the event driven model this book is densely written yet surprisingly easy to read ranadive provides a good background for students and internet entrepreneurs all those who think the event driven business world started with jim clark and netscape are in for a shock we recommend this book to leaders thinking of shifting to an event driven business mode you ll also like it if you want enough background to join the conversation about how event driven organizations function 
another satisfying entry in the series i collect this series hungrily there are always at least stories that excite and amaze me and i do feel they can honestly be called the best of each year i also buy stacks of other genre anthologies none of which demonstrate such consistent quality how there came to be a gap on my shelf where this volume ought to be i m not sure but i did find out while shopping for its replacement what others have discovered it is frustratingly difficult to get an accurate report of the contents of each of these volumes of the several well written and helpful reader reviews one refers to the th edition another while begging amazon to represent it faithfully nevertheless is clearly misfiled describing the contents of the th to be sure even as i snarl and curse my way through the tangle of confusion i salute each reviewer s insights i only wish their efforts could be properly represented to help other benighted seekers i m suggesting a visit to this site an extremely valuable and meticulously maintained resource locusmagcomindex 
compulsion and healing when i started reading this book i had little or no sympathy with dana lustig and his decision to return all the little rocks his late mother had collected from britain s ancient landmarks seemed inane although lustig makes interesting connections between his mother s private secret pathology and the collecting obsession that affects nearly one out of every three of us americans it is still something of a shock to see a son washing his mother s dirty linen in public i guess if she didn t want the world to know about her mania for british rocks she would have destroyed her collection or for we collectors hate to throw anything away she might have been more upfront asked her son never to expose her peccadillos to the world she wasn t the world s best mother by dana s account so maybe a bit of filial resentment motivated his memoir which takes the familiar creative non fiction format of angela s ashes and turns it into a travelogue in which we see the now middle aged dana trotting back to england and trying to alert officials and the media in each town that he has landed and that long ago his mother had done a bad thing and tried to steal their history some of the officials are sympathetic to his quest others treat him like he s some kind of shady character british wit and understatement are in short supply nowadays or so it seems from lustig s colorless interactions with these bureaucrats and tabloid hacks how i wish this book had an accompanying cd in which we could hear the revealing radio interview his mother gave long ago in which dana finds her voice still speaking to him from beyond the grave he parses her syntax to little bits isolating the words in which she condemns herself and shows them to us as proof of his thesis this book deserves more attention it is ultimately a warm healing portrait of a man who while attempting to right family wrongs comes to understand his beloved frankie wasn t as awful as all that 
good introductory text and overview of the industry i read from alchemy to ipo for an mba course on entrepreneurialism in the pharmaceutical industry given my background undergraduate business financial analyst role limited in depth scientific knowledge i found this book to be a very useful and balanced guide to both the business and technical aspects of biotechnology robbinsroth includes enough information on initial public offerings ipos and merger activity among biotech firms to warm the hearts of the most resolute business student but the drug discovery and development process is also covered in sufficient detail to give the lay reader an understanding for the operational challenges faced by firms in this sector add to this the competent yet necessarily superficial descriptions of more esoteric terms such as monoclonal antibodies and combinatorial chemistry and you have a solid text that covers the industry and its ongoing challenges very well

best intro to vulnerability discovery this book is designed as a beyond hacking exposed type book it certainly lives up to that by concentrating on more fundamental knowledge among it s strong points this book is the most solid introduction to vulnerability discovery techniques i have seen another point to this books credit is that i was unable to find any errors in the examples i ran about half the authors start out with a chapters that discuss things like what pen testing is ethics legal issues some of the more useful discussions in this section include legal issues and reporting vulnerabilities to vendors some of the less useful discussions include the difference between gray white and black hats omitted was discussion the true old schoool meaning of hacker the first chapters rate three stars chapters and discuss some cool tools including pf amap ettercap xprobe metasploit canvas and imact enough information is included to get you going on each one also the underlying principles are discussed good chapters chapters and rate four stars chapters through discuss programming linux exploits shell code and windows exploits the programming survival skills chapter is a little light but that can only be expected these chapters are very well done and this is the best section of the book the explanations are very clear and concise i tried many of the examples in these chapters and they worked flawlessly the authors attention to detail will make these chapters very valuable to those learning vulnerability research and discovery the material here provides a solid foundation chapters through rate a strong five stars chapters through discuss reverse engineering writing exploits and patching the holes tools discuss include valgrind sharefuzz spike ida pro rats its debuggers and more this is a nice introduction to reverse engineering it s enough to get you going but it s not quite as deep as many will probably want the discussions here are well done chapters through rate a weak five stars overall i rated this book a strong four stars i would have loved to give it five stars if the first few chapters were better i wouldn t mind seeing them removed and replaced with expanded technical content in any future editions based on the strengh of the remainder of this book it s hard to imagine a better introduction to advanced vulnerability discovery techniques i wish i had this a few years ago

full of adventure will keep you reading i couldn t believe this story was written in the th century ! the structure read like a modern novel you won t be disappointed with the adventures that these characters get into it is also a nice insight into ancient chinese thought about political legitimacy and virtue while very gory at times this book really shows you how the ancient chinese thought the morals are also applicable to today 
breathtaking art owning all of the boxed sets of the lotr s trilogy i found myself utterly fascinated with the various documentaries on the discs about the making of the film especially with the art designs the paintings storyboards miniatures here are men who are supremely talented artists whose paintings and drawings would never been seen by most people were it not for the dvds and books like this this is high art gorgeous and breathtaking and on a par if not surpassing the works of people like the hildebrandt brothers who have been long known for their paintings of middle earth next to people like alan lee the hildebrandts work seems child like in its intent the painting of the nazgul looking down like a vulture over the town of bree just waiting is marvelous the nazgul their wriath images revealed to a startled frodo when he puts the ring on atop weathertop treebeard shelob the fantastic pencil drawings these films created literally thousands of masterpieces of fantasy art just a fantastic book and at over pages it s not some fluff marketing item but a book for serious fans and collectors

a rare gift this is arguably the greatest british novel concerning the first world war the society it changed and killed off forever and the sheer state of stagnation and disaster of english society and social structure and that of both her allies and enemies in the great war that led to millions of needless deaths and the death of britain and europe as dominant world powers that mantle being handed over to america from such a simple story of doomed love and repression madox ford is one of only a handful of english writers who can capture the essense of england and push through his message with such force i expect some readers will find the book a little slow errudite and jar a little at the couple of anti semite comments made disraeli as a loathsome little jew but in a way that better evokes the era europe tried to recapture its lost dominance by using the jew as a scapegoat that culminated in an even bigger tragedy less than a generation later a true and criminally forgotten masterpiece

a lovely knitting book of baby afghans macomber s patterns for baby afghans is lovely ! the recommended yarns are easily obtainable and affordable the variety of afghans can be for babies toddlers and could easily be altered for adults i gave it stars because the patterns were a little difficult to follow because of the formatting on the page and the lack of charts the one i am working on could have been easier to follow if it had a chart i had to retype the pattern to make it easier to follow do not let this discourage you from purchasing the book just an observation and recommendation for future books

a classic self improvement book anyone that has ever made a living in sales has heard of this book there is a reason why it s so well known it s damn good ! frank bettger a former major league baseball player details the numerous techniques habits ways of thinking he discovered on his own or from others that elevated him from near drop out to top producer in insurance sales and speaker on dale carnegie s circuit while the goal of the book is clearly to help others improve their sales skills h irmfftsis is also inspirational in that it demonstrates that you with the help of others and drive determination can really improve yourself in whatever you do get good advice follow it religiously and succeed that s the underlying theme of the book the book is well written and interesting younger readers will notice some turns of phrase or speech not commonly used today but the book is still relevant sales may mean different things to different people and there are certainly many facets to being a good salesman but it comes down to only a few things most simply sales is getting the customer to genuine like and trust you and be interested in what you have to say most of the great information in h irmfftsis relates to improving people skills even if you re not in sales you could greatly improve your professional standing by reading and applying bettger s principles and methods put another way it s a must read for anyone that wants to improve how s he relates to others

one of my favorites this was my first koontz book since then i ve read many and i think it s still my favorite one reviewer said it will likely let you down unless your favorite theme in koontz s books is the transcendence of horror by uplifting spirituality well yes ! that s the whole reason i read koontz books otherwise i don t think i d be able to sleep at night ! i love the redemption twist he writes into many of his stories the face anyone anyone can write straight horror without hope but koontz acknowledges a bigger picture and i hope he keeps it up 
a useful contribution on the subject as a cunnilingus devotee for several years i have bought other books on it both for the pleasure of reading them and any extra information that will help me pleasure my women this way they have certainly appreciated it ! the books have much common information as you d expect but like this one they have different emphasis and different topics the investment in buying all the cunnilingus books isn t big less than and is well worthwhile for the spice it will give both to you as a performer and your woman in the event she is a reluctant receiver this one has some erotic short stories inserted at the chapter ends which are good as i find reading one aloud to my girlfriend puts her in the mood for extra passionate lovemaking im not giving this book stars however because although the information is comprehensive it would have benefited from a good structural editor and an editor should have dealt with comments such as that in the foreword by the author that she is uniquely qualified to write this book like the ultimate in the title this is quite unjustified i think the drawings are a little lacking in finess the publisher could have found someone better to do them 
not my favorite perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers those who detested it said it was because of the violence those who like it apparently liked it because it was by nora roberts there are the usual nora roberts fixtures here a beautiful independent tough heroine r rated sex scenes handsome and talented lovers flowers etc it has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts but there s nothing very mysterious about it anyone who doesn t know who the arsonist is after the first fire hasn t paid much attention in fact i kept wanting to tell reena to wake up and go get him perhaps the biggest departure from ms roberts previous books for me at least is the rather humdrum atmosphere ambience is the writer s strongest suit in other works alaska in winter an island off boston chesapeake bay ireland louisiana etc old baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop aren t quite the same still the writing is mostly good and i kept reading a second rate nora roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today 
fun for all ages this is a great book ! it has wonderful illustrations hence the caldecott medal and an engaging story my son loves this book especially turning the pages to find out what the overcoat will become next this is not just a children s book since i gave it to my professor and his wife and they both loved it this is one of the books that i don t get tired of reading over and over

a scholarly look at ecclesiastes this is not a book of light reading but i was drawn to the title as a possible source of insight in one of the most problematic books of the bible ecclesiastes or qohelet as it is known to jewish scholars in fact fox intended a time to tear down and a time to build up a rereading of ecclesiastes for jewish scholars i am not jewish or a scholar of biblical texts but a curious biological scientist so be warned qohelet is not precisely equal to ecclesiastes as fox points out but the two books are essentially just different versions of the same writing how old it is is debatable possibly rd century bce but we do not know for sure it is unlikely to have been written by solomon even though qohelet identifies himself as a king in jerusalem and a son of david the book starts with the statement utterly absurd said qohelet utterly absurd all is absurd or in ecclesiastes vanity of vanities all is vanity this starting point sets the tone of a very strange statement of faith the world is sometimes unfair even though in a just world the wicked would be punished and the good would live long happy lives still one should enjoy the pleasures one has and fear god that is the message of qohelet and if it seems to resemble some egyptian or greek philosophy one should not be surprised for the author almost was certainly aware of these ideas qohelet is struck with the absurdity of life and the fact that god s actions sometimes if not often seem absurd yet there is some sort of system a time to for every matter under heaven a time to be born and a time to die as the well known verses go yet the race does not belong to the swift nor war to the mighty for a time of mishap befalls them all qohelet was under some suspicion by early scholars and was almost removed from scripture the book seems to question god and says that we know nothing of what may or may not lay beyond the grave however the loss of this book would have been a great tragedy as it would have robbed us of some of the most beautiful quotes in the bible in my opinion for what it is worth qohelet states the obvious but often conveniently overlooked fact that life is often hard and unfair ignoring that fact does not in my opinion lead to solid faith i can state this from experience because the assurance that god would always make things right in spite of obvious pain eventually helped make me an agnostic still i cannot discount the possibility of god s existence i just do not know thus qohelet s observations ring true to me and it comes down to a more complex reality indeed this is a major bone that i have to pick with much of modern religiosity in that it tends to simplify and express itself in sound bites not with the deeper understanding of man s inability to really know the nature of whatever is meant by god again this is not an easy book but it is well worth the exploration those who will take the time will find a deeper understanding of ecclesiastes in what christians call the old testament 
sustainable communities judy and michael corbett have written a brief and thoughtful not to mention well informed book on the subject of designing and building sustainable communities the various chapters on the history of their subject on their seminal and justifiably respected community in davis ca and on elements of the planning process and the integration of real estate pragmatics with environmental ideals will serve as both a user friendly introduction for lay readers and a handy reference for professionals looking to expand their horizons the writing is clear and uncomplicated the design of the book is simple and straightforward and there is the nice sense throughout that it has been put together by people who know wherof they speak one complaint it s unclear why a paperback published by a non academic press would be priced a bit high but it is unfortunate as it will serve to prevent this book from reaching the broader audience it deserves 
eye opening book for those interested in place or language though you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read gaston bachelard s quotthe poetics of space quot bachelard argues that language especially poetry can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space especially of our home space for example he considers how common phrases such as quotgo up to the attic quot and quotgo down to the basement quot are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended as he does with other such observations bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives in addition to exploring how we experience space and place bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight roughly speaking he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something by reading this beautifully written and engaging book you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived grown up felt comfortable or alienated had a feeling of wonder or fear etc i recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space in language and what it can reveal to us or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language

does the field of intention love nature the power of intention is both inspiring and troubling as an environmental and social activist who lives off of less the k per year i was wondering as i read this book if i was holding in my hands what was once an ancient tree our ancient ancestors are being clear cut at an alarming rate in the pacific northwest most will go extinct in our lifetimes corporations continue to consolidate their political power in both mainstream parties democrat and republican alike enact legislation on behalf of corporations that will open what is left of these ancient giants to clear cutting stories will be told of these trees on day perhaps even to our own grandchildren beginning with the words once upon a time there was a great and majestic forest your democratic and republican representatives are now organizing the last buffalo hunt you can still have your voice be heard on behalf of these ancient trees before it is too late on page of his book mr dyer makes the following observation practice kindness toward the earth by picking up a piece of litter that s on your path or saying a silent prayer of gratitude for the existence of rain the color of flowers or even the paper you hold in your hand that was donated by a tree sadly mr dyer s observation is confused the paper we hold in our hands is produced by multi national corporations on public lands administered by bureaucrats marching to one tune politicians who accept large gratuities in the form of moneyed transactions so favorable legislation opens these national treasures to exploitation this book review is offered as a creative challenge to mr dyer to connect to the field of intention on behalf of non sentient life hopefully the field of intention extends the same beneficence to the astonishing field of nature not in a fashion that promotes anthropocentrism and narcissism but rather amplifies the web of life and its connections to human life so that a win win situation is advocated rather than diminished this begs the question is the book worth the i paid to read it i suppose that if the field of intention can be tapped into for the benefit of our earth mother my answer is yes ! if on the other hand the spiritual principles are used only for generating prosperity for the self alone then the would be better spent planting a tree to help offset the expense of mr dyer s next best seller 
i loved it the inferno written by dante alighieri around is about a man who has somewhat lost his way morally on earth so he is granted a tour through hell i loved this book because i found the many circles and subdivisions of hell that dante created to be very fascinating and i also very much enjoyed reading about the gravity of certain sins through the eyes of such an old school catholic such as dante john ciardi s translations were wonderful because he made dantes analytical and sometimes difficult speech into a form that was more modern and easier to understand without losing the feelings and the flavor behind the original this book was very entertaining and i cant wait to read the purgatorio

a very good coming of age novel the narrator is will mclean a georgian of irish descent and son of a marine in he enters the fictional carolina military institute in charleston like all the plebes firstyears but especially as an outsider he finds life at the institute to be brutal but he finds three friends who stand by him tradd st croix an old charlestonian from a very rich and respected family pig a rough italian and mark another muscular italian from up north the rough but kindly bear barrineau asks mclean to keep an eye on the institute s first black cadet but mclean s journey to manhood is full of twists and turns as he falls for a girl whose life he can never be a part of and also finds hismelf embroiled with a shadowy corrupt gang of institute cadets and grads called the ten this plot is interwoven among pages of musing on the beauty of charleston the fiece loyal love of boys who ve been through hell together regret what it takes to become not just a man but your own man courage and triumph there is a lot of purple prose and some rather awkward dialogue or at least stretches of dialgue that don t seem to belogn to the scenes they re in and while conrad s remarks on the vietnam war which proceeds to escalate as the book pregresses are poignant in their understatedness the first black cadet subplot is seen only from a distance in staccato blips and conroy has absolutely nothing weighty to say on the matter of race racism in the south racism in the military or the appalling horrors a brave black knob would face instead he has his narrator describe in great detail his final basketball game which he won with such a sweet shot man give me a break and some of the books big revelations are easily guessed far in advance and leave the reader wondering why will doesn t piece together the obvious clues himself still despite the book s flaws it is for the most part fine reading conroy does have much of note to say on the subjects of maturing and courage and i raced through its pages conroy also has a way with words and can turn a poetic phrase or two even if he gets melodramatic at times and he knows just how to lead the reader along on an emotional roller coaster ride it s not up there with the all time classics but it s one of the finer popular novels you ll find 
an excellent book i enjoyed this book with all the tips on saving and handling money however i believe that on should know more about investing i agree with the other reviewers that this book is an outstanding essay for those who want to learn how to select stocks for a portfolio where we differ is that the typical investor he does not have the resources to build a properly diversified portfolio in order to have adequate diversification you must assemble several hundred issues well beyond the resources of the average investor further one must have the time and skill to evaluate several thousand issues there is a body of knowledge called modern portfolio that is deep in sophisticated statistics utility theory and higher mathematics not easily comprehended by laymen however executing these proven techniques is quite simple i can offer a solution to this problem i want to recommend for you a book titled how to make money in the stock market buy different stocks for pay no commission this book is a must for those wanting to find out about indexing and exchange traded funds and why their use is a superior method for the small investor and big one too this book is an outstanding guide to personal investing it will be useful to all investors from novices to highly the highly experienced this book prepares the reader to approach investing from the standpoint of the underlying science it is the antithesis of a get rich quick scheme all aspects of modern portfolio theory and passive index investing are explained in a through and easily understood manner the aspect i like most is that as well as a solid theoretical foundation the book is very practical and shows the reader how to create and more importantly and manage over time a successful portfolio this is a great book for the beginning investor it s a great place to start and for the experienced investor there are many valuable suggestions the book can be read in about an hour and understood by a year old its a shame to think of how much money investors have lost investing in the stock market over the years i wish i had read this little book years ago the chapter on automatic investing recommends a number of portfolios that follow modern portfolio theory and adjust risk as you age without any effort on the part of the reader at all had this book been written years ago and had i followed its directions i would be rich today of that i am certain nevertheless i will pursue one of the portfolios recommended and stick to my chosen asset plan 
a great book it s a highly informative and non judgemental history of not only celibacy but also sexuality in general throughout many different times and cultures i loved the way abbott managed to relate each form of celibacy to the social religious moral and economical circumstances in which it appeared it gives the reader a broader understanding of societies and individuals who embraced or rejected celibacy in addition to this history of celibacy is beautifully written maybe more difficult but extremely pleasurable to read its also good for learning new words especially if you re a non native english speaker i wish i d read this book before i took my gre it would ve added at least points to my verbal score 
i love this trouble one of the best aspects of this book was when it ended it was left open for a sequel ! will maggie open her mind to her obvious mystical talents will she date either of the very attractive men in her life the dark and mysterious man or the light yet strong guy i was completely delighted with the trouble with magic while it is chicklitish it is a refreshing change of pace from all of the cookie cutter chick lit books that are flooding the market right now the mystical aspects offer alt s readers just the right twist to mix a main stream book with tons of suspense and a bit of spookiness i m looking forward to the next installment of maggie and magic

all the pluses and minuses of the series as is the case in all the quotwriters guide to everyday life quot books it is of course impossible for author varhola to cover in full depth in so brief a book the vast and complex canvas that was the american civil war that much said he does a very good job with the space he has his price lists descriptions of money and period terms are especially well done and useful and i found his descriptions of city life fascinating as is usual he does slip up once or twice canned goods for example were developed in napoleonic france and first commercially manufactured in the usa in the s though it s true that the industry didn t really take off till the war created a huge demand for portable food with a long shelf life but that s probably inevitable he also provides a lengthy bibliography which with the recommendations on this page should give interested readers plenty of detailed background on the aspects that most intrigue them this is definitely a book that should be read by all cw social history buffs 
best nutrition resource ever i bought this book when it was first published many years ago since then i have probably bought copies it still remains one of the best sources for info and basic guide to what nutrition is all about all of the writers books are good but this is my favorite one it really holds up to the test of time easy to understand 
this book saved my life i like jane austen but this is a very special book even for her when i was widowed a few years ago i read persuasion lots or people here love this book but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on we live in a youth oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life you can start again and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around when you were young and didn t know what life was about i know some people prefer the dashing heroes in austen s other books but anne and captain wentworth are much closer to who most of us are we are not flashy or rich we don t always have supportive families our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they ve looked in our hearts love will not bring us land or access to the powerful and it won t make our families act more kindly to us but what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life death sickness insensitive people while women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early th century they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages the value of maturity how having baggage can be a sign that one has been places and seen things and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man because most women and men don t value these concepts persuasion is not ranked as highly as austen s more exciting earlier novels still if i could only take one book with me to a desert island this would probably be the one 
a good start with several flaws this is a good start in its sheer breadth of knowledge it covers a vast array of questions from pre emptic strikes to the status of civilians and the question of responsibility wonderful discussions on all aspects fo waging war from blockades to the question of appeasement a very fascinating read with several minor flaws the first major flaw is the preoccupation of this book with western conflicts major wars with millions of dead have been waged in this century alone that did not involve the west for instance the iran iraq war little analysis in this study is given to the question of a non western perespective on war and what it means for western nations confronting non western ones who live by completely different rules the second major flaw is the all to often obsession with treating terrorism without mentioning islam in the chapter on terrorism and guerilla war their is a disproportionate focus on the ira and the stern gang which would make one assume that these organizations were disproportionatly good examples of terrorism the opposite is true not one sentence in fact not one word in this study deals with islamic terrorism which just happens to be the main confict in the world today the question of just wars was obviously aimed at the recent iraq war so why not deal with the question of sept flaws such as this point to an overreaching political correctness which takes away from this volumnes very heroic attempt to understand modern war seth j frantzma 
o rourke mocks at just about everything in this book o rourke is his usual savagely funny self as he gives his views on politics welfare medicare republicans democrats the clintons monica lewinsky and life in general he is particulalry funny when demolishing hillary clinton s book it takes a village and another bizarre book apparently a handbook of politically correct language this book sounded so totally weird i wasn t sure that he didn t invent it as a joke his piece about india is particlarly good nobody else writes about foreign parts as well as o rourke occasionaly i found myself getting irritated as when he gets all michael moore ish about women going on about how intelligent efficient competent and generally more adult and better than men they are i hate this not being at all efficient competent and adult myself i find myself deeply loathing mrs o rourke and all thoise other smartallick women who are so different from me he s at it again later in the book when he s on about women being wonderful with children etc crikey all these female paragons he seems to know make me tired and it startles me a bit to find that he doesn t believe that elian s father had any right to have his son returned to him as a father himself i would have expected him to be more sympathetic to father s rights however in general this is a very funny book his comparisons between venice italy and venice las vegas had me in stitches likewise his experiments with wine tastinghis most profound comment in the book is quotthe difference between having one child and having two is like the difference between keeping a dog and running a zoo quot that is so true and his wife is probably not as tiresome in real life as she seems to be in this book very funny 
we have found that this book is a must for any avid griller out of many of my cookbooks or recipes i keep coming back to this one i have received more raves about my cooking when i use something from this book the recipes are easy to read the grilling tips are right on i have found that i can try anything and it comes out great ! 
a classic black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african american studies a classic work of sociology that still resonates today it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology however a school that today stands in some disrepute at least in some circles indirectly it was the target of james baldwin s famous attack on richard wright in his essay everybody s protest novel the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school due to its insistance upon using a quotscientific approach quot merely reproduces the very terms under which african americans have been oppressed a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno still black metropolis is a landmark study and unfortunately many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse not better since the year of black metropolis publication which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society since then as we know we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days so much so in fact that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book embodying american liberalism as it does which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look 
collegehumor loved it me too streeter and sarah of collegehumor both who i adore said they loved this book that it was the best dating book i saw in the editorial saw i read it they were right ! as they always are it is very funny and also very helpful with lots of good advice you should especially read it if you are in college or even just in that age range

a surprisingly gripping tale of adventure before reading sea of glory i had not heard of the u s exploring expedition or any of its crew members having read nathaniel philbrick s wonderful account of the voyage i find its continued obscurity striking despite the tremendous controversy that surrounded the ex ex and its volatile commander it made significant and lasting contributions to science cartography and the international reputation of the united states in addition to discovering antarctica and charting much of its coast the expedition mapped an incredible number of islands and coastlines and returned a treasure trove of scientific observations and specimens sea of glory is at its core an adventure story hundreds of men and a half dozen ships set sail knowing they would be at sea for at least three years in addition to sailing into literally uncharted waters the men would have to survive a host of challenges if they were to return home the ships were tossed about by storms battered by icebergs and severely damaged by reefs and sandbars the men themselves meanwhile had to deal with frigid temperatures angry natives and their always unpredictable commander charles wilkes the reader will quickly appreciate how incredibly dangerous the journey was and marvel at the fact that anyone survived it beyond the rigors of life at sea and the impressive accomplishments of the expedition i was especially struck by how different the world was just a century and a half ago no one knew the location or size of antarctica assuming it even existed the west coast of north america was barely charted and was not at all certain to become part of the united states a sailing expedition consisting of six ships and just a handful of scientists was able to profoundly impact multiple branches of science because the exploring expedition was a government sanctioned scientific endeavor all of its members were required to keep detailed journals during the voyage thanks to this requirement philbrick is able to provide a highly detailed account of all that happened and allows his readers to see into the minds of both the commander and the crew it is certainly a story worth reading and i will recommend sea of glory to others you will find this book especially enjoyable if you are a fan of magellan cook or other maritime explorers 
banville s er black s style since benjamin black s identity is revealed on the dust cover it is no secret that he is really john banville although this book is more accessable than banville s earlier works it is no less intriguing the real genius behind his writing is his ability like a minimalist painter to create an entire character with the briefest of strokes his characterizations even of the smallest characters are so acute that the richness of his books fills out to the furthest corner he does not sacrifice his literary talent even when writing a thriller like christine falls here s hoping that black had as much fun writing this book as the reader has reading it and that there will be many more instllments featuring quirke

wordsworth poet of anxiety i entirely disagree with the prevailing reviews on the prelude we have no other secular poem about the futile search for meaning in a meaningless world so fine as the prelude it is the paradise lost of those who search or long for a fleeting significance what is significant about the poem is not that we believe what wordsworth claims about the power of nature and the mind but that he tried so hard to search out some sense of meaning and order wordsworth is the first modernist writer before there was a name for his anxiety this edition is wonderful in the way that it presents the and versions on opposite pages it also contains the version a real tour de force read the prelude read it carefully and take it too heart there is no song of myself without wordsworth s humane yet promethean quest for significance 
millenium madness one of the coolest books we ve read in a good while norman cohn s book talks about revolutionary millenarians and mystical anarchists of the middle ages that is nutcases from the flagellants to naked wandering preachers to the disaffected masses who would march off to plunder europe and the holy land in the name of the cross this book is chock full of instructive and highly amusing anecdotes about a staggering cross section of millenial lunacy not just for fun and games though his bibliography spans nearly a hundred pages and this is a classic historical work historyhousecom 
terrific collection of freud material for any undergraduate i think this is a terrific compilation of freud material that would be helpful to any psychology student pursuing psychoanalysis and a search for knowledge in the subject of psychology the author does a tremendous job of picking the most important works of freud and putting them in a proper reading order for the less experienced student i think that the author should be commended for his work in translating and interpreting this material and i would recomend this to anyone no matter what the cost ! i think this may be the best and most valuable set of books you could ever buy 
a very readable and enlightening history overall this is a very good history of modern africa while a lengthy pages book the fate of africa has a flowing narrative that makes it quite enjoyable to read the text is supported by the inclusion of a nice selection of black andwhite photographs and several maps depicting the various regions of the continent it is impossible to come away from the book with any attitude other than one that must regard contemporary africa as a place of unrelenting squalor violence and disease this is not meredith s bias but simply a consequence of his objective reportage of events as they have unfolded since the early s there is no way to gloss over a numbing and depressing litany of despots massacres epidemics and atrocities there are many villains few heroes and a vast and disturbingly faceless array of victims in the pages of recent african history meredith tries to portray the end of apartheidt in south africa as a rare but triumphal achievement of the african spirit amidst all the unrelenting horror but anyone with even a passing awareness of conditions in south africa today massive crime covertly organized campaigns of violence that are leading to the emigration of many whites the uncontrolled influx of immigrants from poorer regions of the continent straining existing social and economic resources and the crippling of a large segment of the black population from aids will recognize that the downfall of afrikaner rule is cruelly unlikely to lead the country into a new era of stability or prosperity to his credit meredith does not close the book with an extended recitation of how can we save africa colossal sums of money have been spent to save africa with little to show for it save the enrichment of a tiny coterie of dictators the intervention of western powersis rarely done with the most noble of intentions there is no clearer example of this than the eye opening disclosure of the machinations of the french government in rwanda in the mid s actions which as meredith relates exacerbated the dutiful slaughter of the tutsi at the hands of their erstwhile hutu neighbors the task of converting their continent from a place of ceaseless misery and suffering to one with a promise of a better existence for its millions lies for better or worse with the africans themselves it will be interesting to see what happens in africa in the next decade i am sure meredith will be the writer best qualified to tell us the story as it unfolds 
review by happy the silver chair was an excellent read filled with action adventure and peril the tale starts out with two adolescents named jill pole and eustice scrubb they are about to get whisked away to the magical land of narnia a secret mission is given to them by the ruler of the land aslan the great lion their job is to rescue the prince rilian of narnia who is said to have been killed on a hunting trip years and years ago with the help of their new friend puddleglum the marsh wiggle pole and scrubb will go through a series of challenges which will test their friendship and their faith in aslan the most essential part of their mission for reasons i can t spoil for you all from fighting through blizzards to fording ice cold rivers to escaping from the flooding of an underground fortress this is a great book from start to finish right from the beginning i could tell that this would be a great book c s lewis has done a phenomenal job with this book i would never have thought that he could surpass the other books in the series but he did pole and scrubb go everywhere there s a big lord of the rings type journey thorough the mountains a jack and the bean stock style of escaping a castle they even go underground into the heart of narnia a little c s lewis original twist there is absolutely no way to guess where prince rilian is until the answer is upon you all hope is lost until bam ! the children find the missing piece to the puzzle they solve the riddles and they find that they were closer to the answer then ever before i personally thought that they were going to die they get trapped underground by a powerful witch there s about earth men that are against them as well i didn t see hope i can t say what happens but i ll say this it turns out good in conclusion the silver chair was a great and epic tale i recommend reading the other chronicles of narnia first seeing as this book is the sixth installment to the series it s very hard to understand without the background information if you like the lord of the rings you ve got to read this 
should be required reading for baseball fans i must preface this by saying that i read this book after it was reccomended to me by the sports editor of a local paper this book and veeck s life are nothing short of amazing in these times of high ticket prices and salaries it is fasciniating to read about how veeck bought and sold major league franchises sometimes with little to no capital or cash to start with veeck is also the pioneer of the idea of going to a baseball game and being entertained he came up with some of the wackiest and funniest promotions and ideas ever and they are all contained in this book on top of that he was a genuinely funny guy which also comes across throughout the course of the book every baseball fan should read this book to realize exactly how much veeck shaped the experience of going to a baseball game like we know it today

plain everyday wanting to write i m your plain everyday wanting to be writer i found on writing to be one of the best books i ve read mr king writes of his childhood and life in the first part of this book then in the second half gives advice on how to write which i have highlighted and marked up something awful i was one of those teenagers he talks about in his book that failed english in high school and thought i was dumb because of it i did write as a child only for myself not like mr king who wrote for dave s rag i loved the parts that spoke of his and his brothers dreams escapades or just having fun growing up it brought back memories of me and my brother i ve read a few books by king but i find i loved this one the most i m one of the older crowd five years older then mr king i wish he would write more books on plain everyday life as he lived with his brother and mother for me and others out there who don t want to read murder mystery etc i m not saying i didn t like misery because i did i guess now in my elder years i m just looking for a little less anxiety i guess i m what you call old and want to think of the world as a loving place and nothing more i know i m just dreaming about loving your neighbor but i do believe that people are out there to love one another i tried my hand at self publishing a book named fears flutterby maybe if mr king reads this he can give me some tips 
good book the readings are pretty good and insightful the chapters are long enough to complete in one sitting and provides the ability for comprehension without too much reading the topics provide deep thought and are right on point 
this cat has nine lives i didn t know what i was getting into when i picked up this book the title caught stealing at first suggested a crime story however it was immediately clear that the subject of baseball is the string that gets the main character hank through what is an extremely rough ten days in late september and yes there is crime involved a lot of crime this story is very well written the writing is straightforward conversational and quick even without the use of quotation marks or dialog attributions i had no trouble following it the writing is what got me to sit through seemingly endless gratuitous violence and the prolific use of the fword which actually doesn t bother me i believed this is indeed how each of the characters hank his shaky neighbor the rotten cop all the thugs and hank s co horts at the bar where he worked until the first beating got the best of him spoke this way in other words the use of voice is dead on audible further it made me glad i don t hang around in such circles i don t think hank ever expected to find himself in this situation either which makes him all the more likable we sympathize with him from the start because of his lost dream of being a major league baseball player and then because of the death of his friend who died in a car accident when hank was behind the wheel it also doesn t hurt that he continually checks in with his parents in spite of the reeking bleeding killing character he becomes charlie huston has the reader rooting for him until the end the baseball theme and a fan s addiction to his team is a clever ploy it ties in nicely with hank s addiction to alcohol bottom line i simply had to keep turning pages to find out hank s next move and whether or not his adopted cat bud would make it through the ordeal as well ultimately it seems the cat gets the most respect from the author of im living your dream life and the things i wish i d said mckenna publishing group

makes a great gift i am buying several copies of a short guide to a happy life and giving them as gifts to my graduating daughter and several of her close friends from high school for a little more than the cost of a greeting card that gets tossed after first examination this poetic book of a mere fifty pages provides the perfect inspiration we all need to refer to from time to time this tiny tome proves that you don t need a war andpeacesized novel to deliver a message get a life a real life not a manic pursuit of the next promotion the bigger paycheck the larger house do you think you d care so much about those things if you developed an aneurysm one afternoon or found a lump in your breast while in the shower p quindlen writes simply succinctly and sweetly and puts down in words what we all really truly know deep down but need reminding of on occasion 
this is a good manual except this is a very well written manual of jo exercises the descriptions are easy to understand and in a couple of places the author also shows the wrong way to do the lesson so that the reader doesn t do that the quality of the photos is much better than some other manualsthis book focuses on the techniques so all though the book tells a little bit of history history is not the main issue that might affect your decision to buy the book either positively or negatively my only complaint is directed at this class of book and not really this book alone i would like to see some of these books published with a spiral binding like a technical manual so that it can lay flat on a table if i could read the advice while i m trying to practice the lesson while i have a jo in my hands and i m standing in chudan kumae i would be happier

wonderfully masterful i am no expert in the area of mathematical analysis but i am an avid reader of any book that pertains the subject i found this book in my schools mathematics lounge and could not resist reading it from cover to cover this book is of the quality of such authors as buck widder courant and rudin as another reviewer has noted this book is definitely worth every penny it is not dry or to pedantic as some of the other afore mentioned authors yet it is not simple and lacking in content of course like any quality advanced calculus book it requires the reader to have mathematical maturity as well as patience and the drive to self explore the concepts if one cannot follow simple examples and from those examples formulate their own they may want to review the very basics of mathematics or consider a different major i would highly recommend this book to advanced undergraduates or beginning gradutes students as a reference book or for self study 
now there should be no excuse for those claiming a lack of good historical sources of the first voyage around the globe for lovers of the non fiction accounts of sacrifices made in pursuit of honor riches and glory this book should be a great find readers will be convinced beyond doubt of the struggles magellan and his crew endured in their historic voyage masterfully recreated from several historical resources biographer laurence bergreen brings to life the cost of bearing the title of discoverer resurrected in the story are the deviousness of the human character the lust for currency greater than gold the spices the once undoubted might of the former spanish armada and the terrible cost for it all the loss of human life carefully constructed story coupled with an excellent writing this should be on the reading list of every reader dreaming of the voyages of the glorious past by simon cleveland

turner s frontier thesis unfiltered this is a very useful collection of ten essays by university of wisconsin harvard university historian frederick jackson turner written through out his career edited and introduced by john mack faragher this book is a very fine entre point to the thought of turner the first of the essays published here is turner s seminal work the significance of the frontier in american history an essay that defined a whole field of research read at the annual meeting of the american historical association in chicago this paper has exerted an enormously powerful force on the historiography of the united states in no small measure because of its powerful statement of american exceptionalism turner took as his cue an observation in the u s census that the american frontier had for the first time closed he noted up to our own day american history has been in a large degree the history of the colonization of the great west the existence of an area of free land its continuous recession and the advance of american settlement westward explain american development turner insisted that the frontier made americans american gave the nation its democratic character and ensured the virtues of self reliance community egalitarianism and the promise of justice he noted that cheap or even free land provided a safety valve that protected the nation against uprisings of the poverty stricken and malcontented the frontier also produced a people with coarseness and strength acuteness and inquisitiveness that practical and inventive turn of mind full of restless and nervous energy that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom it gave the people of the united states in essence virtually every positive quality they have ever possessed despite criticisms through at least the s vision of the frontier reigned supreme as an underlying definer of american character it conjured up an image of self reliant americans moving westward in sweeping waves of discovery exploration conquest and settlement of an untamed wilderness and in the process of movement the europeans who settled north america became an indigenous american people in turner s characterization the frontier concept has always carried with it the ideals of optimism democracy and meritocracy it also summoned in the popular mind a wide range of vivid and memorable tales of heroism each a morally justified step toward the modern democratic state the popular conception of westering and the settlement of the american continent by europeans has been a powerful metaphor for the uniqueness of america in the twentieth century as explained in faragher s introduction in the latter half of the twentieth century historians increasingly questioned turner s frontier ideal arguing that it reduced the complexity of events to a relatively static morality play avoided matters that challenged or contradicted the myth viewed americans moving westward as inherently good and their opponents as evil and ignored the cultural context of westward migration they determined that turner s frontier thesis was excessively ethnocentric nationalistic and somewhat jingoistic his rhetoric excluded more than it covered moreover failing to do justice to diverse western people and events in addition to the title essay this excellent collection of the essays of frederick jackson turner includes such articles as social forces in american history the western and american ideals and the significance of sections in american history this is an indispensable source for the thinking of frederick jackson turner and his influence on thinking about the history of the american west 
truly enjoyable i loved the entire book my favorite story is when bernard s father goes through a fictitious phase of marriage 
a fresh original translation byrom s translation of the ashtavakra gita a classic hindu text considered to be written by an enlightened master is amazing reading one gets the feeling that the words themselves do not exist but that a direct transmission from a master is occurring an absolute must read for anyone on the non dual spiritual path hindu buddhist or whomever but especially recommended to western followers of the path of advaita vedanta nondual hinduism 
captivating quotsix characters in search of an author quot is truly a unique play for some readers characters on paper are actual human beings but once we see them portrayed by genuine living people on the stage and big small screen we abandon our imagination about the person the character began as luigi pirandello took this idea and wrote an ingenious play is reality in fact reality or is it only what we perceive it to be this play opens up a world of uncertainty the concept of the play challenges the mind i recommend 
it must be good university libraries don t have it reckon i ll have to put out good money for this book university of maryland doesn t carry it nor does the consortium of seven private university libraries and nor does the montgomery county md public library this despite an interesting and relevant topic and reasonably robust sales hmmmm i add a year later i have now read the book it is refreshingly direct in the voices of boalt hall students themselves a few anonymous and a few who disagree with the book s thesis still five stars 
i sing your praises this book was nothing less than a page turner mark plotkin weaves his tale of adventure and peril of suriname with a style unsuspected of a scientist dr plotkin goes to the amazon in search of plants with medicinal value the book is not so much dedicated to his finds but his interaction with people and animals of the rainforest furthermore the book is steeped with the cultural plight and history of the natives interspersed throughout one can find history lessons of certain plants for instance coffee originated in ethiopia before politics and redistribution landed the plant in brazil i must say i found dr plotkin s tale to be inspirational and was sad to see the book come to an end

good book used it to help write a graduate paper i needed a book that had paranthetical references and this book had quite a few would have loved it if there were more though this is actually a very good book it teaches practical common sense mixed with historical overviews of international trade practices forwarding laws promotion and marketing plans advertising strategies it is a very good book that will provide a breadth of knowledge for the enterprising importer exporter i would recommended it for both business and academic purposes although if you are looking for more academic reference based books in this area you should also consult academic publishing companies that focus more on referenced materials overall very informative book 
very well written book about capitalism and democracy although this book was written many years ago it rings true for today s issues the book is made up of multiple or so mini essays each about pages long the book has a clear and logical philosophy that is consistent its basic premise is that pure capitalism is the first and only moral system for man this is because capitalism equals freedom which frees a man from coercive oppression and that man can only create wealth and new ideas when free to use his mind the book states that the us briefly came close to pure capitalism in the and s but is now heading to fascism as the state leaves property in private ownership but the state controls output and use of the private property this book is the best i ve read in several years because it helped me unify my outlook on several fronts political economic legal social etc into one grand consistent theory i think this book will appeal to liberals and conservatives alike both are damned in this book by rand but i think the left right and center will recognize parts of rand s philosophy that are dear to them too read it for yourself to see the book is cheap

the first of the meme wars john barnes assembles a vision of the future in the best tradition of true science fiction visionaries what happens if society decides to experiment on itself by altering the fundamental manner in which it raises its children with the intent of producing vastly smarter and more responsible youngsters capable of entering the workforce at an earlier age with adult like attitudes and skill sets that would make a modern college graduate green with envy what happens to the adults upon whom the responsibility falls to raise the children in such a manner whatever does happen it had better work because the earth is failing rapidly as a result of ecological warfare on an unheard of scale with the biosphere s state swinging first one way then another mankind needs new crews to man the great interplanetary transports that are hoped will be able to ship enough people off earth and enough food back to keep everything from the brink of collapse and the only way to get enough competent crew crew who are willing to spend their lives in space and want to stay there indeed have every reason to stay there are to raise them there so that is their home from the beginning and how do you get a crew like that quicker than the to years a typical top flight astronaut takes to develop you take a new system of learning that completely revolutionizes the education process the technical results are impressive but the social results are interesting to say the least the characters of the novel are the children of the experiment and a few adults for the most part it is a coming of age story told anew for it is a coming of age to adulthood far earlier than any children in history it is told with bright eyed clarity and absolute precision the author tells of pre adolescence from the point of view of those going through it the technology its assumptions and the society built by the expediency of need and its assumptions all drive the combination of assertions that create the knitted whole that is orbital resonance those who are well read enough to know of alexi panshin s book rite of passage nebula award winner for best novel will appreciate this book even more orbital resonance was a nebula award nominee for best novel

first rate like a lot of folks i have a fascination with the s and the title essay from this collection a look at the hippie scene in the haight ashbury section of san francisco is one of the classic contemporary reports on the counter culture ironically the title picked from yeats poem the second coming was intended to suggest that hippiedom was the coming paradigm in reality didion completed her essay shortly before the death of the hippie slouching towards bethlehem is the best book of essays i have ever by the grace of god been fortunate enough to own and read in essay after essay i found myself saying quotgo on joan you said it joan we are the same you and i joan etc quot that is the type of book slouching towards bethlehem is reading it slowly meticulously i felt such a close kinship a bond not with the writer but with her words so carefully chosen and wonderfully articulated if you re looking for another great book to read try the bark of the dogwood  with its jaw dropping scenes hilarity and darkness all woven together it takes place in the s s s and well into the s showing a variety of culture and class not to be missed this one 
research material not for the faint hearted readers can expect to suffer through numerous footnotes and liberal sprinklings of quotes in greek latin french and german that is not to say that the author has done a poor job the content is very informative just slow reading the author has provided a well put together bien tenu history of piracy in the mediterranean from ancient times to the formation of the roman empire first century a d based upon the writings of semi contemporary authors and ancient authors such as xenophon cicero plutarch and such the content was originally published in by the liverpool university press the two maps attached to the end of the text are very helpful at finding the many locations cited by the author bottom line be prepared for a non trivial read p 
finally the real story is told what a wonderful job mr noles does in telling the story and interweaving the lives of these two unfortunate souls against a backdrop of old florida he is able to convert his massive research into such an interesting read i had difficulty putting it down 
perfect i read this book and realized i could become an expert bomber after reading the first few pages i learned a lot about bombs and fireworks 
the sprawl busters decoder book dolores hayden s intriguing book visually decodes fifty one examples of bad building in the landscape and the use of aerial photography to do this was a good idea sprawl by its nature stretches off into the horizon but when seen at ground level could seem pretty ordinary some of the differences though especially with domestic dwellings seem a bit arbitrary there are seven examples of housing shown which to me don t seem that different with commercial sprawl it is easy to understand the visual differences from rural slammer soledad to tank farm part of the port of houston though the book is primarily visual with seventy five well chosen aerial photos used to illustrate the categories i thought the essay on the first ten pages was first class in explaining the reasons behind sprawl basically the fault of those folk in washington allowing commercial interests to favor suburban white populations and male headed households during the last few decades the back of the book has a useful bibliography list of websites and index jim wark s aerial photos were used by the author to carefully explain the categories and you can see several hundred other examples of his work in america isbn if you like aerial photos have a look at alex maclean s book designs on the land isbn with over four hundred stunning color photos of what is happening commercially on the ground though a large number of americans live in the sprawl environment and by choice too it is worth remembering that over ninety percent of the us is still open land this fascinating book is a useful visual guide to how bad things can get 
lifesaver this book helps fill in the empty spaces that people and their families face before durring and after treatment it is a good book to keep handy for reference i found in my own personal recovery this book the big book and the twelve and twelve of great importance to my sobority 
death and disease level all men this novel is a combination of a roman clefs and science fiction with gothic and autobiographic elements in her vision of the end of the st century mary shelley sees the greek occupying istanbul and england as a republic with three political parties royalists democrats and aristocrats the leader of the democrats deserts his responsibilities through fear of the plague while the intention of the head of the aristocrats a highly idealized portrait of p b shelley is to diminish the power of the aristocracy to effect a greater equalization of wealth and privilege and to introduce a perfect system of republican government byron lord raymond is not in the same league power was the aim of all his endeavors the selected passion was ambition her vision of mankind is pessimistic there was but one good and one evil in the world life and death for life the choice is with us let us will it and our habitation becomes a paradise but what is there in our nature that is for ever urging us on towards pain and misery we are not formed for enjoyment disappointment is the never failing pilot of our life s bark and ruthlessly carries us to the shoals it is a strange fact but incontestable that the philanthropist who ardent in his desire to do good who disdains other argument than truth has less influence over men s mind than he who refuses not to adopt any means nor diffuse any falsehood for the advancement of his cause man doesn t control his destiny and the whole of mankind is wiped out by the plague but even on the verge of total destruction false prophets preach intolerance with their pernicious doctrines of election and special grace this book is brilliantly written he was no longer bent to the ground like an over nursed flower of spring that shooting up beyond its strength is weighed down even by its own coronal of blossoms it has a few minus points slow progression too idealized main characters and a rather too simplistic cause of the whole destruction of mankind but it remains a real discovery and a very worth while read with an excellent introduction by pamela bickley many novels have the plague as subject i recommend highly bassompierre by hugo von hofmannsthal 
enjoyable i found this book reminiscent of books by charles dickens in that it featured a large cast of odd characters whose lives continued to intersect eventually forming one huge convoluted web realizing this was the case early on i enjoyed discovering how everyone would eventually meet the book tells the story of daniel a boy who falls in love with a novel by julian carax he tries to find another book by this author but comes to find out that he seems to be in possession of the only remaining copy of any of this author s books someone is traveling across europe stealing or buying all of carax s books and setting fire to them thus daniel embarks on a quest to figure out what happened to carax whether he is in fact dead and why someone would want to burn his novels i found the ending of this book in which it was finally clear how all of the stories affected each other extremely gratifying the novel was a bit long winded in parts and perhaps could have been a hundred pages or so shorter but i still enjoyed it a great deal 
favorite storyline of the film and most definitely my favorite out of the first graphics novels of sin city dwight mccarthy is a dangerous and sexy man with a love that he will have always and never the women of old town are the enforcers of their part of sin city with nothing but their wit and the pistol they re packing to protect themselves from the pimps and the mob their story is by far my favorite 
simple and gritty what is so interesting to me about this book is how simple the story is anse bundren is the stubborn oldgoat of a father and husband who has promised his dying and later deceased wife addie that he will bury her in her home town of jefferson when she dies as i lay dying recounts the death and then trip to jefferson one tragic mishap after the other through the view points of the members of bundren family and others associated with them these first person accounts from the characters brilliantly reveal the rather gritty and mostly unfortunate existence of the bundrens which appears to be the point of the book even more than the story itself 
mr sportstelevision meets mr boxing mr kindred is a wonderful storyteller in this very readable dual biography of two controversial men muhammad ali and howard cosell like beyond glory by david margolick which tells another story of a white man and a black man linked by history in the s sound and fury is a history of a later era the chaotic s and a history of two outsiders mr margolick makes clear that their relationship was less of a friendship and more of a partnership the two of them never hung out socially but each saw the other as a genius in their domain who could further their respective careers this book is a wonderful introduction to their lives for any reader who was born after the time when muhammad ali and howard cosell had already come and gone and as a reminder to those of us who were there

making the difference nance s book is one that i keep with me all the time it seems that every time i come across a tough patch of communication with someone about a difficult situation or subject there is always assistance in this book it opens up a huge new world of communication and support for those people we want to help or when we need help if everyone had this book we would no longer be afraid to commmunicate both in speaking and listening 
special i love appalachia history and would rate this as my favorite book on the subject i hated to see the book end 
science and religion join hands to oppress even when leiber was trying to write something serious he still couldn t help being satirical as when he describes aerial dogfights between angels and demons only they happen to be airplanes disguised as each the demons even have horns you smile even if you don t want to and there s really not much to smile at in this tale of a post nuclearwar world in which the power hungry use science and religion to enrich themselves at the expense of a povery striken world it s a subversive novel actually because leiber is clearly informing us than when when political power over people is involved it doesn t matter whether people worship god or the devil because for all practical purposes they re the same thing as almost always with leiber there are cats involved although in this case they are minor characters 
a nice review of all of the major myths of greece this book offers a nice overview of greek mythology all of the major stories and many of the minors are included here i would have liked to see more of the myths from other cultures but it is understandable that they are not included given the fact that the work was done in the s a worthwhile introduction to myths 
shocking developments regarding roarke s past in my mind one of the keys to keep a series going as long as j d robb has is to get the readers to identify with the characters at some level that is why the author provides us with information about the main characters past in every book and continues developing their stories looking forward we have seen that a good portion of the previous novels has been devoted to the past of our heroine lieutenant eve dallas the abuse by her father and the shock of killing him when she was a kid in order to escape are present in every installment of this series we do know some facts about roarke s past too an abusive father and a mother that abandoned him but in this novel we are faced with a truth that shakes the foundation of the billionaire besides the personal stories we are always presented with cleverly crafted mysteries and even though in this book the case eve is working on takes a secondary part it fulfills its role regarding entertainment action and suspense everything starts when nadine furst a reporter for channel and friend of eve receives an anonymous message that leads her to believe someone is dead she calls eve and the lieutenant quickly finds the body of a young girl inside a recycle bin nadine not only received a message but also photos of the victim before and after being killed with the latter one being staged the victim was taking a course in imaging so eve and her aide delia peabody start going after the killer with this consideration in mind as robb has done in some of her previous books we get to read into the killer mind in some of the passages and find out that this person believes that the victims will live forever through the images this one is one of the best installments in the series so far because the developments in roarke s personal story create an unparalleled eagerness on the reader i know it did in my case since i read this one in a single sitting there are also other developments like the relationship between peabody and mcnabb moving forward with them thinking about living together and the fact that mavis is pregnant as the series progresses i have found that it is harder and harder for the author to inform the reader of everything that has occurred in the past of this set of characters so you will be missing important points if you have not read the previous books for those that have been following eve s adventures i hope that you agree with me in that this book is without a doubt among the best by robb 
could even be life changing i had to read this book for a psychology class and ended up loving it the book goes through the life cycle and explains the losses we must make at each stage in order to move on to the next one if this book does not move you than you are made of stone 
a shining example of how to live the gospel if you read nothing else this summer please read this book this book has moved me and inspired me and is the most awesome example of one christian man living out a truly christ like example no matter where he was or who was watching 
worth reading i ve recently discovered and began to enjoy nora roberts books private scandals kept me entertained but the identity of the stalker obsessive fan murderer was easy to figure out since i m horrible at solving mysteries and my guess turned out to be correct the book did drag at spots certain things became repetitive and were more in depth than necessary the abundance of sex scenes became annoying i don t think that for normal couples every little kiss morphs into a ridiculously passionate lovemaking session but then again this was in part a romance novel but these parts were not necessary to the plot and i began skimming over them after a few other facets of the book were somewhat far fetched but again it s fiction worth reading but check it out from the library instead of purchasing the book 
meant to be miraculous true stories to inspire a lifetime o one of the best books i have ever read i was inspired amazed uplifted and brought to tears time and time again i wanted to savor it but couldn t put it down each story was so amazing and unlike anything you will read elsewhere you won t be disappointed by purchasing this book i ve been recommending it to everyone i know 
an excellent resource this is a great resource especially for new parents we learned a lot about how to keep our baby happy and content by recreating the fourth trimester womb experience of course every piece of advice in the book did not work exactly for our little one but many did and we took an a la carte approach using the book to customize the best way to keep him happy and get a little more sleep ourselves 
is this book for you who will most enjoy runaway old hearts who need defibrillating back to a life of passion if you want to feel again that rush of first love the sinking of personal rejection the stabbing realization you ve missed out been decieved or made a mistake jump in the recently or imminently divorced what are you running from what else will you lose in the bargain tired of your humdrum life munro finds the bizarre the magical the extraordinary in middle class or back woods lives mothers the stories celebrate the intricate psychological and social lives of ordinary women most poignant is silence a heart wrenching mystery of a daughter s desertion of her mother if you enjoy strong fiction but don t have huge blocks of time to read the stories are short but rich aspiring writers of short fiction long established as a master of the craft munro is able to draw both scope and depth into each character each setting each situation immediately she is both entertainer and prophet of the modern human condition in my opinion the book falls short of stars because of the unconvincing portayal of life in the early th century in the story powers 
there is historical evidence note please that my rating should be discounted as i have not rated the book however i can address two harsh criticisms of it by john j geyer jgeyer in that review here at amazon we read if a rampaging army storms through canaan destroying city after city one would expect that the remains of those cities would show appropriate destruction layers and that the diplomatic archives of the surrounding countries would notice there is nothing actually there is a very much evidence of such destruction to be found in city after city in the holy land albeit at layers not deemed appropriate for the commonly accepted historical era of joshua s invasion however a quick google search on lisa liel or lisa jah will lead you to her website at http wwwstarwaysnetlisatitled lisas world then click on history then the exodus in history and scroll down to the chart of the historical vs the biblical view of history of the land of israel immediately above that chart we read a simple redating of the archaeological periods in the land of israel brings the entire scope of biblical history into synchronization with the ancient historical record only time will tell whether more archaeologists will follow cohen and anati in their slowly dawning recognition of the historicity of the bible pursuing the website in greater depth will quickly show you that the historical record is full of evidence but again that adjustment in dating mentioned is required john j geyer jgeyer also wrote this criticism for the bottom line as the author acknowledges repeatedly is that there is no evidence confirming any part of the exodus story but if lisa liel s dating shift is done to bring the historical caanan archaeological evidence into sync with the biblical then the same exact time shift shows at the appropriate era in the separate egyptian historical record this datum plague is throughout the land blood is everywhere the river is blood that is our water ! that is our happiness ! what shall we do in respect thereof all is ruin trees are destroyed no fruit or herbs are found forsooth gates columns and walls are consumed by fire forsooth grain has perished on every side the land is not light darkthis authentic historical egyptian record is of troubles plaguing that kingdom dated near the time of the first intermediate period of bloodshed and anarchy resulting from the collapse of the monarchy of the old kingdom of egypt lisa writes when the bible tells us that egypt would never be the same after the exodus it was no exaggeration with invasions from all directions virtually all subsequent kings of egypt were of ethiopian libyan or asiatic descent when chazal tell us that king solomon was able to marry pharaoh s daughter despite the ban on marrying egyptian converts until they have been jewish for three generations because she was not of the original egyptian nation there is no reason to be surprised ah gardiner admonitions of an egyptian sage from a hieratic papyrus in leiden historians are almost unanimous in dating this papyrus to the very beginning of the middle kingdom the events it describes consequently deal with the end of the old kingdom 
humor and helpful all in one when first looking at the book it almost seemed impossible for such a thin book to be of much help for students however after reading the book in the span of hr i might boast i realized that this amazingly funny book can be just as equally helpful contrary to a former reviewer s complaint about the book merely stroking the ego of college professors i believe through personal experience that being on the good side of a professor is very helpful to gaining better grades so in the end buy the book you lazy students and hopefully learn a thing or two 
the best of the simpsons books from an academic perspective david arnold et al s book is amusing but too lite on theory at times with non mediascholars coming to grand conclusions that media scholars in the eighties came to mark pinsky s book is a very amusing book written with such a love for the program that it s delightful but i didn t feel it enlightened me about the simpsons as much as it made a strong argument for and defense of its morality and ethics a book that s a must for simpsons dislikers steven keslowitz s book is atrocious poorly written and not worthy of a single purchase which leaves this book as the best serious treatment of the simpsons why not the th star well several of the contributors start to wander away from the topic and i also feel that if you re going to analyze the media in an academic way you need to secure a few more articles from actual media scholars this oversight is evident in the lack of essays looking at the simpsons from some form of structural or economic standpoint the book is more humanities based than social sciences and that s a pity however it still examines some important issues and thus digs under the surface of the text in a convincing and thoughtful way alberti s introduction is arguably the best article in the book as he positions the program brilliantly and gives a great sense of the ways in which the simpsons might be doing something special that very few if any other programs in television history have i found the essays thought provoking and a lot more dense than other writing on the simpsons so while i could see how a fan of the show who wants to keep viewing it as light and mellow wouldn t enjoy this book or appreciate it if you actually want to engage with the program and its politics on a deeper level this book does an admirable job very good stuff some essays especially excellen

history forum not a riview of this is a history forum and i like it opinion so there is a lot of hate between greeks and turks between armenians and turks between bulgars and turks between rusians and turks between arabs and turks also turks today are anti americans but why why the turks learn history from their books it is crazy if you read two national histories you will find a different interpretation for one historical event i am writing some examples a greeks have learnt in their books that at their ancestors made a revolution against the turks there were many revolutionary waves during the turkish occupation etc for the same period and events turks have learnt that there was an illegal divulsion from ottoman empire b yenichars are the most terrible event for greeks and a good scholarship from sultan to young cristian boys for turks there is not a common sense here if we read books like these we will feel only hate opinion it is difficult for me to believe that there was not an armenian genocide it is difficult for me to believe that greeks or armenians burnt smyrna the turkish president said that these issues belongs to historians not to politicians let use the archieves and we will see do you know about official ottoman archieves if not imagine the official nazi archieves about the holocaust you can search a hole life and you will not find an evidence of course a turk believes something else about the second opinion but probably he can understand the first one i hope all of us greeks armenians turks read history it is good for our life to know about our roots we can read history to learn the events without forget anything but not to influence the present situation

a good plan to end terror i have to agree with the authors there is far too much anti americanism in the world today everywhere you go people are blaming the bad united states for all the evils in this world some of these evils were born in third world countries dominated by a dictator and the population just blames the bad ole u samuslim fundamentalism was born in a wahhabi saudi arabia and spun out to the rest of the arab world this fundamentalist religious movement turned into a political movement fascinated with terrorism what is america to do with all these threats the authors give an idea of what to do in this book i don t agree with everything that is said in this book at least the authors have a plan on how our country should lead the world to face the conflict of terror it will not be easy and it could cost some blood and treasure but at the same time the usa will face down some of those threats to its existence this involves confronting saudi arabia france iran north korea and china no wonder the authors got so many negative reviews as the authors state this doesn t mean war with these countries it does mean that the united states must take a tougher line against those who condone or even encourage the use of terror this is a nice thought provoking book there is a lot of suggestions which the united states ought to think about or even implement

autobiographical look at a paranoid schizophrenic this book is one of philip k dick s most autobiographical and is about the least well known time of his life he had just left his wife and kids in a stately house north of san francisco to live with the junkies and vagrants of san mateo the house that he lived in became well known as a place where people that were into drugs could go and always find more of what they were looking for and usually something new as well dick himself only did acid once he preferred the more predictable effects of prescription drug abuse and he called his experience with lsd the most terrifying hours of his life the loss of identity that this book takes to extremes really did affect the people of dick s house in san mateo paranoid theories ran rampant and no one really knew who was a narc and who wasn t as such it is an interesting portrait of the collective state of mind that predominated this period as a work of fiction this book has a lot to say about the sources and apparatus of control in society the movie version does a poor job of conveying what is the central evil in the book and in society that dick was trying to get to the heart of newpath is an organization that purports to be the only one in society to be able to deal with the epidemic of drug abuse that substance d is ravaging on society they are however the only group in society that is outside the realm of surveillence to quote enemy of the state who watches the wathchers that is definitely true of this book and reflects dick s deep distrust of the fbi cia to see how far this analogy goes read a scanner darkly and then ask yourself some key questions about the war on drugs 
it would have been great if my wife would have read it or received it with an open mind

tedious voluminous intense having chewed and digested around the world in eighty days five weeks in a balloon and journey to the centre of the earth i set out to devour another chef d oeuvre of verne the often overlooked true father of science fiction with much relish sure leagues seemed bigger than the others i d read but i thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of verne all the way well i was nearly right professor arronax leaves a normal life in france for the us taking his assistant with him to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the modern or known world joined by the egotistic harpooner ned land they seek adventure and they find it again i see verne s classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster the nautilus or rather as the nautilus finds them they awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea the professor is fascinated or perhaps intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours days and months observing and recording the tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant classifies it all this is where the tedium began for me as the reader pages upon pages of pure taxonomy the accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief the enigmatic captain nemo is in charge incidents and never accidents everything about him is shrouded in mystery pondering on the life of captain nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages however you can never miss verne s climactic scenes where he brings drama and suspense to their peak the almighty nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the south pole and for the first time captain nemo shows signs of worry however subtle yet he goes on with a steely determination things are looking very desperate but as usual the day is saved however i found myself following every detail sharing all their fears their toil their despair their ecstasy was mine when the nautilus broke free i was totally drawn in the irritable ned land sparks the fire of escape he s sick and tired of submarine life as nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges the adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma or does it i guess it continued with captain nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea or did he live forever a highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or verne fanatic

a must for the jazz drummer i m simply going to reinforce what you may have heard elsewhere this is as good a foundational text on jazz and bop drumming as you can find along with ed soph s and jim chapin s books if you are interested in learning to play jazz and bop on the drums this book takes you from a level assuming some knowledge of the drum kit little knowledge of jazz and brings the two together in a very logical way i have milked four years so far many more to go out of this book with regards to the density depth and entertainment interestlevel of the material 
always glad to have more muldoon i felt that this book exceeds moy sand and grave in quality it evokes some of the mystery of muldoon s previous work many of his poems are densely inscrutable yet somehow utterly compelling one often gets the impression that he may be obliquely referencing things beyond what is immediately offered in the writing but i am not much of a scholar is there a skeleton key 
evoluting and grahamesque after reading and re reading this collection the first thought that crossed my mind was quoti want something magnificent to happen to me today quot i felt myself dissolving from today and re emerging into a mythical tomorrow where words and phrases would be coins of the realm graham is the owner magic spellbinding and lucid and yet swirling together the elements of the actual and the figurative hybrids of each other till the eventuality of their meanings and intents just simply trade places ! graham s poems are the unravelling of mystery that in the end remain more mysterious than ever and to live there must always be mystery lest our lives lose their meanings i was not the same when i set the book down 
great book and intro to the computer repair business if you want a book heavy on accounting theory or how to repair some rare technical problem this isn t it if however you are looking for a book to help you tell if this is the correct business for you and perhaps how to start such an enterprise it clearly is ! morris is grounded by his years of experience in the field and uses that experience to explain what is different about the field he does a great job explaining how to make the jump into the field a success ! no one resource will prepare you to enter this business but morris book made my start a roaring success dave hayde

dover thrift edition of center of the earth isbn this dover thrift edition of journey to the centre of the earth published by routledge in is one of the three translations which are faithful to the verne original the usual translation refers to prof von hardwigg and adds and changes much material this translation refers to prof lidenbrodk thus retaining verne s original nomenclature although an anonymous translation it may have been made by henry frith who translated other verne books for routledge a note of caution amazon lumps all versions of this title together in reviews so be aware that this review applies only to the dover thrift edition isbn 
mocking the mediaeval views of victorian england at its core a room with a view is a simple pleasant romantic comedy no less predictable and sentimental than many books in the genre but this is e m forster who suffuses his story with both droll dialogue and a satirical touch that somehow manages to be simultaneously lighthearted and acidic lucy honeychurch is the young british heroine who visits florence with her prim proper and priggish older cousin even before i saw the merchant ivory movie i imagined maggie smith in the latter role early in the book two events shatter lucy s oppressive victorian facade first she witnesses a murder on the streets of florence and then george a carefree young man staying in the same pensione spontaneously and forwardly kisses her in a meadow following her embarrassment lucy returns to england and becomes engaged to cecil an appropriately named cad whose stiffness and artificiality exceed even those of her cousin and who should know no one intimately least of all a woman soon after the engagement lucy s newly respectable life is thrown into disarray once again when george and his father become neighbors it is fate that i am here exclaims george to a minister friend with a rationalistic bent but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy into this formula forster blends both social satire and political themes the novel s political views are far less developed and serve more to define the characters than to present the struggle between aristocratic affectations and democratic even socialist principles most comically cecil s overt professions in favor of egalitarianism are little more than a patronizing haughty and occasionally cruel pose the social satire however is integral to the book skewering the mediaeval pretensions of victorian england he portrays cecil as the type who s kept europe back for a thousand years and george as the progressive visionary who decries the brutish desire to govern a woman and argues for a world in which men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden lucy finds herself caught between their nineteenth and twentieth century views it s an unfair struggle between those who long to remain mired in the past and those who march bravely into the future

this book and the quotquality pioneers quot one of the unique qualities of this quotfive pillars quot book is that it covers in detail the contributions of all the early quotquality pioneers quotincluding juran deming feigenbaum and crosby it also covers the works of others who have contributed to our knowledge on quotmanagementquot matters writ large not just the far more narrowly focused quotquality control quot literature for example the works of drucker iacocca and the like are also covered and blended with those of the quality pioneers the quotfive pillars quot praises deming for what he contributed to the quality movement but also places his contributions in their needed perspective for those seeking real and not superficial results accordingly it is not suprising that one balaji s reddi from pune maharashtra india would not like the book it will be noted that balaji s reddie is an electrical engineer who specializes in teaching the quotdeming way quot in fact his e mail address places him at quotdemingindiaorgquot within the pages of the quotfive pillars of tqm quot the prediction is made that the book will draw flak from those who have turned deming into quotthe man who discovered quality quot and the quotpatron saint quot of quality management it took a long time for the flak to arrive and then all the way from india ! in fact a deciple of walter shewhart of the bell laboratories along with joseph juran w edwards deming made contributions of the quotspcquot and quotsqcquot variety of quotqmquot but provided false and irrelevant guidance on most of the broader management issues quottqmquota term invented by general bill creech is likened as quottotalquot because its reach is far broader than a set of quality control tools and the quotfive pillars quot book says that in an unambiguous fashion quotprocessquot being but one of the five pillars upon which success is built what is taught at the demingindia organization is unknown to this reviwer but according to balaji s reddie s reaction it is certainly not the broad based approach to quotquality management quot that the bill creech book is all about read it and verify that for yourself 
colorful children s book though perhaps not completely correct in teaching your child about chameleons this book is adorable my three yearold son and i read it at the library and he kept asking about it so i ordered it for him he really enjoys reading it again and again 
a refreshing story companions of the night by vivan vande velde is a refreshing vampire story from the typical vampire genre today although it still is of course a romance and the two protagonists sort of end up liking the other one very much the vampire character ethan seems much more mysterious than regular vampire characters and you can never really guess who he is and what he s going to do which only adds to the suspense and excitement the love interest also isn t typical as well as you can see strength from her in the end she does something very hard but courageous which leaves ethan quiet and she honestly deserves enough respect as any other human girl should ever deserve also the storyline is something different it begins when kerry the girl ends up in the laundry place all tied up with a strange group of men holding a handsome boy hostage as they escape she learns he s a vampire but her involvement in his escape leads the group to kidnap her family and put them in danger and thus they band up for unknown reasons until the end to find her missing father and brother throughout the story motives of ethan s helpful nature is questionable and kerry is constantly left in the dark about him and what he really knows about this whole kidnapping issue this time though you re honestly confused whose the good guy and whose the bad guy should ethan be trusted why does he act this way who should our main character side with the vampire or this other character whose sworn to kill all vampires additionally the paragraph size and simple vocabulary makes this book a breeze to read honestly buy it you d be doing yourself a creepily good favor 
a good introduction to darwin and animal rights i read this a year and a half ago in vicenza italy it is an excellent introduction to darwin and animal rights rachels makes you feel that he knows his history of whatever he writes about his book on euthanasia is also good 
a logical argument and yet more troops are being sent now arnove s book lays out in a pretty straight forward manner pages not counting the foreword afterword appendix acknowledgement and notes the case for pulling all u s troops out of iraq immediately i read a few other books about iraq before reading this one and i would suggest that to any reader just so they have a frame of reference while reading it arnove tries to use well known quotes and facts to support his argument and this helps but there is still so much information on such a complex issue that i think it would be difficult to read this and fully comprehend it with no prior knowledge of iraq arnove makes a very compelling case what s sad is that he s using readily available information to make it and yet we re now sending more troops to iraq i think the only fault of the book is expecting that it will drive people to action arnove isn t really presenting anything new just laying all the facts out for us in a very clean logical way almost like he s writing his thesis while this style might work if arnove were a lawyer convicting bush of war crimes it just serves to further highlight how this administration works above the law and gets away with it even with this much clear evidence against the war it continues on 
tried it and wow it worked for me this kit arrived for my birthday and i used the cut glass crystal as instructed and could really feel and even see the interaction of the spinning crystal with my finger energy i could feel tingling in my meridians and more energy the crystal is not used as a pendulum but is twisted to make it spin over key areas really very intriguing and effective then i had to do other things and got in at pm thought i would watch the dvd did the exercises along with the dvd then thought i d do some internet research got up to stretch and thought the clock must have stopped it was am and i didn t feel tired at all ! i was so energized that i hardly slept even when i got to bed had to get up at am so thought well i ll do the exercizes i learned to help me through the day since i didn t sleep hardly at all i had a great day and was extremely energetic people commented and i am a person who is tired all the time and gets sick from missing sleep ! i love this stuff and am amazed how incredibly well it worked ! but in the future i will certainly be more careful about charging up before going to bed the dvd was like attending a seminar by donna eden a very sweet spirit she introduces you to muscle testing and the energy routines they are not hard to do or to learn i haven t even listened to the cd yet but can see from the cards that it contains more energy tricks i like the cards because they are easy reminders on how to do the exercises as i am learning the maneuvers i am wondering if there is more info in the book i ll probably buy it since i am so impressed with this kit if you are tired all the time buy this kit best wishes to all you intrepid folks wanting to learn more about our miraculous energetic bodies

marxist jesuits first of all malachi martin did not walk out on his order to marry a foreign correspondent during the vatican council as claimed by a previous reviwer in martin received a dispensation from all privileges and obligations deriving from his vows as a jesuit and from priestly ordination congregation for institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life june prot n why would a jesuit priest request such dispensation it is likely because the heterodox jesuit heirarchy would never have allowed him to publish this book he would have had to break his vow of obedience to his superiors within the order to both research and write this book had he not requested such dispensation fr martin would have joined a host of orthodox jesuit priests such as fr cornelius buckley s j and fr joseph fessio s j who were either silenced or the attempt made to silence them by their heterodox brethren i had never heard of malachi martin before i picked up this book but i have attended two jesuit universities and i ve seen the war between orthodox and heterodox jesuits up close it is real and it does exist heterodox jesuits continue to support the dogma of liberation theology which is in reality a blend of catholicism and marxism that is neither authentically catholic nor authentically christian heterodox jesuits teaching in universities are having symposiums on such philosophers as michel foucault which when you consider that foucault advocated sex with children seems more than a little ironic it goes on and on my own experiences with the jesuits lend a boatload of credence to what martin writes the jesuits haven t merely betrayed the heirarchy of the roman catholic church they ve betrayed millions of faithful catholics all over the world especially those faithful in central and south america who were murdered and starved and oppressed by the very same jesuits who said they were there to helpthis book reads like a spy thriller i literally couldn t put it down once i started reading it it seems clear to me that martin had sources that were well placed at very high levels both at the vatican and within the jesuits it is also evident to me that martin is more right than wrong if you want to know what s wrong with the roman catholic church this book goes a long way towards explaining it 
great the anthology is well put together and samples many influencial poets while providing indepth biographical resources and essays 
well written extremely well researched and written triangle is the story of the fire at the triangle shirtwaist factor that killed workers most of them young women david von drehle not only writes about the fire but the events leading up to the fire including a prolonged strike by garment workers in the conditions the workers had to deal with are also described as well as the incredibly long work week hours for low wages which the owners tried to make even lower whenever they could von drehle describes in great detail the fire the workers attempts to escape the fire and the efforts of people both inside and outside the factory that struggled to save the victims he also describes the aftermath of the fire and covers the owner s trial and whether or not they were convicted on any charges finally he includes the first complete list of the fire victims and how they died ive wanted to learn more about the triangle factory fire since i saw a tv movie about it in the late s this book was very informative the history parts were interesting and helped set the picture of what life was like at the time of the fire the parts about the fire were hard to read at times not only because of the depictions of the victims dying but the memories it arose of september th as some victims were forced to jump from the ninth floor windows to escape the flames the aftermath of the fire was also interesting including what happened at the trial of the two owners of the triangle the list of the names of most of the victims six were never identified was compelling and makes readers realize the victims were mostly young women with the rest of their lives ahead of them the list of victims is a perfect example of how well researched the entire book is their names and the various names misreported in the papers ages how they died and who identified the bodies is listed because of the subject matter triangle is at times a difficult read but well worth it

the full sum of the man his work and his times with this volume richard ellmann elevates oscar wilde into the select circle of ireland s other literary giants of whom he wrote so eloquently william butler yeats and james joyce it was left to michael holroyd to give george bernard shaw his due while this volume is a sophisticated wide ranging scholarly biography it also brims with wilde s wit and bold life which as oscar himself pointed out was where his genius lay the slow steady accumulation of detail allusion and anecdote pays off as wilde reaches his pinnacle the original production of quotthe importance of being earnest quotonly to plunge into the abyss of imprisonment as wilde tempts fate with rough trade dalliances and his ill conceived challenge to the marquess of queensbury you find yourself almost shouting out for him to stop and save himself but he doesn t because ellmann makes us understand that wilde s nature led him to that point the end is sad but his wit never deserts him right up until his death throes when he notes that either the wallpaper in the room must go or he must which he does shortly thereafter today qualities that wilde pioneered are a part of modern life camp humor scathing put downs an emphasis on style an obsession with appearances in wilde s day he was an almost solitary figure in that regard leading the way into the modern world the witticisms of quotthe importance of being earnest quot are as humorous and apt today as the day they were first spoken in london in richard ellmann helps us understand why 
thoughtful and important i have to admit that my understanding of this philosophical text by wittgenstein minimal at best the book is small and is broken down into short declarative investigations of the boundaries of human knowledge presented in terms of logic and often symbolic language the mathematical formulas and explanations are extremely complicated and i m sure more background in this area is needed to really grasp the material however there is enough in here that s both cogent and profoundly imaginative to keep casual readers hooked if they re patient this is considered one of the most important works of philosophy in the th century despite wittgenstein s closed door conclusions i ll leave you with the most imortant line in the book a finding of genius or a pretentious cop out you decide what we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence

what the clintons have been up to since they left the white house r emmett tyrell jr is not only the founder of the american spectator but according to hillary clinton he is one of those at the center of the vast right wing conspiracy this amuses tyrell to no end even though the clinton attacks have cost him plenty and he explains why in this book yes there is no love lost between the author and the clintons he loves to talk about what goes on behind the carefully crafted public faade and they like to rail at him for distortions and rehashing material that is old news this book does go over some of the old stuff in passing but most of it focuses on what bill and hillary have been doing since their co presidency ended in if you are a clinton supporter or at least one who accepts the public image of him as a wouldabeengreat president if not for the republican attacks you should avoid this book unless you enjoy getting riled up if you are a true believer in the vast right wing conspiracy and do not want to hear or accept evidence to he contrary again avoid this book if you enjoy reading about more clinton activities and what they usually imply well you will certainly enjoy this book especially if you enjoy hearing bill called things like the most low grade lout ever elected president or the white haired and shrunken clinton is a forlorn figure irritable melancholy and anxious to be remembered well this book will be just what you want it isn t exactly vicious or full of bile but it isn t dispassionate either for me the portions of the book worth the price are the appendices the first lists all of the speaking gigs and the fees received by bill from feb through the end of millions upon millions earned in speaking fees from all over the world and from some folks who really aren t friends of the united states does anyone recall the apoplexy of the democrats when reagan made money from speaking in japan the second appendix lists the pardons and commutations that clinton gave it reads quite strangely i found myself wondering why rolling back an odometer was something that deserves the attention and pardon of the president of the united states of america i think most of the people who read this book will have their minds made up before they turn to the first page but it is worth reading through just to catch up on what the clintons are doing it is hard to get that from tv and the newspapers because most of them are completely focused on either helping getting hillary nominated and elected or undermining her they never get into the level detail that is covered here 
modesty is dignity wendy shalit argues that modesty is a natural virtue that protects women from being treated as sex objects by men and therefore leading to a loss of their dignity she blames many problems in society including anorexia nervosa date rape stalking and self mulitation to the loss of modesty that has occurred with the sexual revolution i was however disappointed with the large amount of quotes from such magazines as glamour and seventeen wil roese

proof that angels walk the earth angel or madman hero or heretic quotin your face quot is the riveting true life story of one of the bravest men in america as hair raising as a well crafted crime novel this book is so shocking it s hard to believe it s not fiction for the fate of animals in laboratories we can only wish it were suspenseful gritty treacherously honest and heart breakingly beautiful quotin your face quot chronicles one man s fight against pet theft and the heinous crimes and atrocities performed on animals every day in the name of medicine chris single handedly champions the animals against the indifference of the public and the legal system toward animal cruelty and injustice chris is living proof that one person can change the world read it and join him but block off some time you won t be able to put it down there s only one thing wrong with this book it wasn t long enough by the way chris claims to not believe in god because a benevolent god couldn t have created a world where there is so much suffering my message to the author cut god some slack chris you re the reason the world is so screwed up god ran out of time creating everyone else he spent all his time on you 
the book was amazing it was in amazing condition i am very pleased with the product 
riveting book you won t regret reading htis book it adds to the human experience and you come away from it enriched by both the writing and the content it explores areas of morality worth thinking about without telling you how to think it s hard to read at times because the author so aptly describes the human experience that it can be painful but that is life afterall i recommend it as a book that promotes growth it is strictly a secular book in that god is never invoked and that is where i would have changed it a bit i believe that all of life is providentially designed and an acknowledgement of that would have given some hope beyond human endeavors but then i am not the author and do not possess the gift of being a wonderful writer like jodi does ! from start to finish it is a wonderful wonderful book that i highly recommend if you ever read these reviews jodi let me thank you for enriching my life sincerely arden detweile
