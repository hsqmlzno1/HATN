good for business more than i needed this is an excellent book i just recently started raising chickens and was disappointed at the information available at the local library i purchased chickens in your backyard a beginner s guide day range poultry every chicken owner s guide to grazing gardens and improving pastures and storey s guide to raising chickens care feeding facilities recent reading at the library about pasture raising livestock got me interested in this title the volume they discuss is a little more than i was interested in but that is not the fault of the book it is well written an easy read and comprehensive in the amount of information it contains the only thing i could add to claudia campbell s comments is that information is also included in business organization strategies and marketing if you go into poultry on this scale it has to make a profit to be sustainable i agree this book is a complete resource as for my ambitions i found chickens in your backyard a beginner s guide an excellent introductory text and storey s guide to raising chickens care feeding facilities adequate for my needs both these books have ample reviews and i could not add to them we live in a small rural area and the library depends on local donations chickens in your backyard and day range poultry will be donated to the library storey s will be kept as a reference 
overall the best various study bibles have different strengths and weaknesses i would have to gives this bible the best all around award its study notes aren t as dry as dust with no indication of what a particular bible verse means to you this bible is excellent at spelling out what a particular verse means to your daily life this bible also has the best introductions to books of the bible quite extensive it s outlines too are very detailed it has the best theological articles many are quite long but expressed in easy to understand language and all of the notes and articles are written as if one person was speaking to another it breaks down the complicated but this bible doesn t have the best leather though it s good enough it doesn t have the largest type though it is readable it doesn t have the best paper though it is adequate and while it is jam packed with notes on verse meanings and theological articles it is relatively easy to handle my review is based on my comparisons with the macarthur study bible the zonderban niv study bible the nelson study bible the kjv study bible the life application study bible and a few others 
a very informative and enjoyable book but author makes some irresponsible choices that can be hard to stomach i am a huge fan of the kind of travel writing that takes you into the lives of other peoples and cultures and this one was a prime example of everything that is really neat about travel and ethnographic writing it was engaging funny relatable and i felt like i really got a picture of what it might have been like to live in that situation i had some mixed feelings about the decisions she made though i can t imagine being compelled by infatuation to shack up with someone who i can t communicate with directly then i can t imagine living with them for a long time and having a child with a person with whom you haven t worked out basic cultural agreements with why in the world did she have a baby with someone in such a different culture without discussing issues with the father such as will my baby have an arranged marriage by the time she is two or will my little girl be circumcised and where did she get all of her money i am and work hard and don t have anywhere near the resources she had was she from a rich family questions like this made the book a richer experience in some ways because those internal struggles made me really think about my culture my beliefs and that of the masai i am not sure i like corinne but there is no doubt that she is a compelling writer and has a very compelling story this would be a great read for a book club because it does bring up so many issues to discuss

the last two actually this is the first installment in a series that looks to have a long life ahead of it the topic has been done in various ways before including pat frank s s mr adam through some cataclysm all men on earth are incapacitated or as here killed all but one y yorick bearer of the last y chromosome on earth second to last if you count his unaccountably live and male pet monkey and we re off it s a mad max world of social collapse fragments of the old order try to maintain some semblance of sanity despite the roving cult gangs that control parts of the landscape and like mad max vehicles and fuel become critical trade goods that s the setting in which yorick agent and a cloning specialist set off one step behind the answer and one step ahead of the warlords and international hit squads chasing them but what about the mysterious ring and amulet this first book serves largely to set the scene define the characters and get the action started and it s off to a good start this has all the makings of a very enjoyable and long lived adventure series and i m coming back for more wiredweir 
too good for words simply put this book is excellent after reading the previous book bird of prey i had a good background knowledge of some of the characters and the world in which it is set the characters are brilliant so are the plots the adventures the intrigue the love triangles the list goes on and on if ever a book deserved stars this is the one 
right on target if this book could be distributed to everyone in america we would no longer live in a morbidly obesce society the information in this book is very easy to understand for even someone who knows nothing about nutrition the diet isn t actually a diet it s a lifestyle change which will add fruitful years to anyone s life while this book does focus on weight loss it is not only for the overweight it deals with getting the body back in balance so you can maintain your normal weight

flat out amazing i have owned this book for over years now and have cooked most everything in it i m telling you honestly that i have yet to cook something out of here that doesn t get snacked on constantly or rave reviews from people that visit my original copy of this fell apart from being used so much ! what i wound up having to do was cut the spine off of the book and rebind it myself im honestly very surprised that this book doesn t have more reviews than it does not only are the recipes wonderful to eat they are fun to read the author adds fun descriptions and background information with every recipe reading these will actually make you want to cook them almost every recipe book that i ve read since has been disappointing in this respect this book raised the bar actually there is one recipe that i haven t been able to cook very well and that is the biscuit i ve dedicated entire days here and there to do nothing but cook batches trying to get it right but they always come out hard and don t taste very good 
bluhnderful i m sure you re wondering what bluh means if you never read this book so i ll explain count olaf reapears with another evil scheme to get their fortune so violet hands out mints to her brother and sister knowing that they re allergic to them just to buy them time away from count olaf who s in yet another silly disguise so klaus gets hives all over his tongue and all he can say is bluh i love that kind of humor it s funnier than i make it sound i wish the movie didn t ignore such funny and clever parts of the story the aunt josephine scenes were done well though and meryl streep deserved some sort of award for her funny peronoid performance she was truly the character since the movie was books in one it ignored a lot of different details from the books due to not having room for them it just shows the children on a boat to find their aunt but never shows the trouble they have to go through to get it in the books they have to worry about olaf s theatre friends being around just as much as they have to worry about olaf the books are clever but it does have it s flaws the kids are supposedto be really smart but you can figure out things that they don t know yet long before they figure it out when there s someone in one of the stories with their face hidden you know it s obviously one of olaf s friends or either olaf in disguise so it s frustrating that in each story the kid s never realize that from the start i still have trouble putting each book down though even if you know from the start they ll bump into olaf and that each book doesn t have an happy ending though it s unpredictable when he will show up and in what disguise or how they will stop him these books manage to be just as addicting as the harry potter books and just as clever too 
good enough few works of fiction particularly those marketed to the masses will result in the perfect combination of suspense believability grammatical compositon language wit historical accuracy plot and character development and neither does high country but it had enough of what was necessary to create a more than readable book maybe a bit heavy on the near death experiences but all in all good enough

pretty good but definitely five for those who love cult movies or people just looking for the tip of the iceberg on good cult movies i highly recommend this book though the book has over fifty movies given with small quotquot seconds synposizes and information reguarding directors plot actors or people s reactions such as critiques of the movies since around fifty movies are picked obviously many movies are left out especially good ones such as in my opinion hedwig and the angry inch or velvet goldmine the author has said that he will maybe make a second volume if he recieves enough emails about the readers favorite cult films his emial is in the book the book features movies such as fight club akira reservoir dogs dr strangeglove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb rocky horror picture show withdrawl and i skidoo carnival of souls freaks faster pussycat kill kill harold and maude ect and this book also addresses whether a cult film can be a blockbuster as well good book n 
helpful guide to coming to grips with the bible the esv reformation study bible has been a great help on my second read through of the bible i firstly read through the nt and then the old using the new tniv bible that version is easier to read than the esv and is a usually reliable update to the venerable niv the translators have attempted to show where original masculine language was intended to be inclusive such as in the use of the greek word adelfoi which sometimes means brothers but often means christian brothers and sisters occasionally this use of gender inclusive language smacks of political correctness and spoils an otherwise helpful translation the esv also often uses inclusive language where this was intended in the original but shrinks from doing this with certain words such as adelfoi and huioi which normally means sons but is often intended to include women as well at times the language in the esv is awkward which i noticed particularly in my read through of hebrews it would be difficult to read to others some verses of the esv and convey the sense correctly the reformation study bible is an extremely helpful guide to the scriptures with excellent introductions to each body of literature in the bible such as the pentateuch the prophets the poetic literature the gospels etc it includes helpful introductions to every bible book and also has usually helpful notes on specific chapters and verses there are also articles on key theological topics which present a reformed point of view as would be expected the editors have shown an awareness of some differences between reformed christians and have written the article on baptism for example with at least a passing acknowledgment of baptists who are otherwise reformed but do not believe that infant baptism is an acceptable application of the bible s instruction on this christian initiation rite the authors of articles and notes include r c sproul keith mathison bruce waltke moises silva james boice edmund clowney j i packer raymond dillard tremper longman gordon mcconville ray ortlund willem vangemeren gordon wenham wayne grudem simon kistemaker and frank thielman this australian reviewer would like to mention that there are also several excellent aussie contributors including leon morris bill dumbrell graeme goldsworthy barry webb and john woodhouse i am disappointed that my hardcover edition has cracked binding i m guessing it came this way but i hope that this is not an indication of poor workmanship in other copies i highly recommend this bible as a wonderful help in coming to understand the word of god more fully

phillips breaks down the walls of misunderstanding the reader from san diego obviously did not read the book not only does phillips separate taggers and gangbangers into different chapters she delineates the underlying similarities in the reasoning and the form of the graffiti of both taggers and gangsters she shows functional and material sociological reasons for the graffiti of these little understood populations while at the same time allowing us to clearly see her own views on the subject she does not try to create a false objectivity additionally the book makes a good read and especially interesting for anyone living in southern california

once more nevermore poe is a poet of great intensity and music of haunting rhythm and obsessive feeling this collection contains the lyrics he is most known for including the title piece his most famous work the haunting the raven but the rhythms of loss and longing and lament which play such a great part in his invocation of lenore who he will see nevermore are also present in his to helen and his annabel lee and there will be other memorable lines as the glory that was greece the grandeur that was rome which will refrain in the reader s mind poe makes his readers sense an echo effect and we hear and hear again his deep beating lines and with them there comes too a sense of deep disturbance a disquiet that is at the heart of america s strangest and most hauntingly gloomy great poet

amusing trivia this book is an irreverent collection of interesting but mostly unimportant historical anecdotes a sampling of stories that i enjoyed the fork at least as used for eating was initially condemned as the devil s pitchfork by priests who thought people ought to eat with their hands witchcraft prosecutions were motivated at least in part by the desire of churches and civil authorities to get the property of the accused until a legal change in prevented them from getting such property similar motivations for the inquisition where property could be confiscated decades after the death of an alleged heretic how had owned it he describes mail order porn in he has a photo of george washington s dentures made from human teeth presumably taken from dead soldiers the medieval church forbade doctors from dissecting human corpses to learn about anatomy and forbade surgery some of the other medical anecdotes suggest that there have been many times when patients would have been better off if the prohibition on surgery had lasted longer dont expect too much wisdom from these stories one isolated place where he attempts a non shallow analysis is when he asks how did child labor start in america and why was it widely tolerated unfortunately his attempts to analyze this merely consist of finding reports of child labor earlier than he thinks his readers expect it doesn t occur to him to ask whether people could even afford to do without child labor before the industrial revolution 
disturbingly fantastic listen to the other reviewers this is not a parody it s not funny i was expecting funny what i got was one of the most dark haunting poking intouncomfortableareas experiences with literature i have ever had and i loved it as other readers have noted it turns the romanticized pro slavery ideology of gwtw on its head if you don t want that okay dont read it but it s done in such a masterfully emotive way that reading it is painful humiliating mesmerizing and sweet sad it s an experience everyone should at least try there is such a wealth of careful detail here and every bit of it hangs together i e is plausible based on the events depicted in gwtw i always did wonder why bad things seemed to happen to melanie whenever the slaves were close by the one thing i d say randall forgot to address was will benteen and suellen o haras claim to tara

digestible philosophy when i received this book i was expecting a more comprehensive survey of greek thought but i was nonetheless pleasantly surprised this very slim book pp is actually a series of lectures delivered by cornford on the development of greek philosophy from ionian science to socrates his pupil plato and his pupil aristotle with nods to others such as pythagoras and democritus along the way cornford delivers in very plain language what he considers to be the essential differences between these thinkers i found this to be a very enjoyable introduction to greek and western philosophy that can be read within an hour or two if only more philosophers would deign to present their theories to the laity as clearly as professor cornford

small but full of useful information i visited nyc for the first time a few weeks ago i took only three books about this city with me this guide the lonely planet nyc guide and the metropolitan museum of art guide truth to be told this guide is probably the only one i couldn t have done without top new york is an extremely useful small guide that doesn t have as much information as the lonely planet nyc guide but that has the essentials and excellent fold out maps in color that are more easily understandable than those of other guides i would like to highlight the fact that even though i am very absent minded i could easily find my way in nyc thanks to those maps and if i can everybody will be able to do that from my point of view this guide is ideal for those tourists that don t have a lot of time and want to see as much as possible during their visit to nyc specifically manhattan if possible without a tourist guide top new york points out quite a few places you simply must go to in the city but also tells you about different neighbourhoods and their history there are many photos in color that help you to decide what you want to do and historic data that allows you to learn about this city moreover most visitors will find the insider tips for tourists helpful and the planned walks and itineraries a good option other useful sections in this guide are for example best shopping districts best hotels for every budget i found my hotel through internet though best restaurants in each area and most fun places for children what is more top new york is almost pocket sized so you can carry it with you everywhere even if your purse is tiny not my case ! or if you have bought too many things and your handbag is rather heavy yes that often happens to me all in all i am very happy i bought this guide and i strongly recommend it to you belen alca 
great attitude great information i wanted to give this a star rating but it s not one of my few bibles i always refer to it definitely is a star in my opinion this is a well written detailed book that goes through virtually everything in buying refitting and maintaning a used boat the aspect i like best is the encouraging style that yes you can do it in each section he recommends starting off with this or that simple project to build up confidence and expierence before starting on the really hard projects like paint the inside of lockers before painting the exterior hull casey also makes good recommendations on materials procedures preparation execution etc all geared to the none pro me well written informative easy to understand written to the regular guy ok i guess i give this star buy it would i buy again definitely 
insightful and thought provoking this book is absolutely amazing i have children with asperger s and temple grandin s insight into why people with autism have certain behaviors was eye opening it also gave me a whole new perspective on what thought processes may effect their ability to learn abstract things and socialize with others i would highly recommend this book to anyone even if you don t personally know someone with autism it can certainly give you a first hand look at how different people think differently

become so well known that scholars consulting this monument to philosophical thought feel a need for page references to find whatever interest in kant they might have at a particular moment such a summary might have been open before nietzsche when he wrote in section of the gay science that over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors such erroneous articles of faith which were continually inherited until they became almost part of the basic endowment of the species include the following that there are enduring things that there are equal things that there are things substances bodies that a thing is what it appears to be that our will is free that what is good for me is also good in itself kant was concerned with transcendental philosophy the general problem of pure reason but in i transcendental doctrine of elements division one book ii chapter ii section iii a on principle of persistence of substance can be found on page division two book ii chapter ii section ix iii the possibility of causality through freedom can be found on page and in ii transcendental doctrine of method chapter ii section ii on the ideal of the highest good can be found on page kants practice of using large heavy type in the text for key terms makes his points much easier to locate in the cambridge university press edition which features some of the heaviest type i ever saw in a book page numbers for the a and b editions are located in the outer margins making it easy to locate quotations by later philosophers who frequently invite their students to read the original work schopenhauer in particular was adamant that kant spoiled the edition when he removed pages to and introduced a number of remarks that controverted it the world as will and representation translated by e f j payne vol p in this part of the second book of the transcendental dialectic first chapter the paralogisms of pure reason was originally intended by kant to illustrate forms of reason which imitate logical thought and appealed strongly to schopenhauer as a basis for his own philosophy which he declared had placed will in place of kant s thing initself as claimed in the nd chapter in the second book of wwr vol pp kant was not trying to make things easier for the philosophers who followed him by providing an easy platform they could use to proclaim their own views as even schopenhauer discerned when he complained that fichte had succeeded in turning the public s attention from kant to himself and in giving to german philosophy the direction in which it was afterwards carried further by schelling finally reaching its goal in the senseless sham wisdom of hegel wwr vol pp schopenhauer does not appear in the index of the cambridge university press edition of kant s critique of pure reason but the index can be used to locate a few notes on swedenborg in gregory r johnson s introduction for kant on swedenborg kant s knowledge of swedenborg s writings are linked to some of the key ideas in kant s critique of pure reason finally swedenborg claims that his visions of the spiritual world do not show the spirit world as it is in itself instead his visions are spatio temporal representations of a non spatiotemporal reality spiritual realities take on this spatio temporal garb to accommodate themselves to the requirements of a finite intellect these teachings presage such central tenets of kant s critique of pure reason as transcendental idealism and the ideality of space and time kant on swedenborg p xviii the notes about swedenborg on pages and of kant s critique call attention to his ironic attack on swedenborgian spiritualism in dreams of a spirit seer and spiritual qualities lampooned then which reappear in kant s elucidation of the limits imposed by the general conditions of experience or a special fundamental power of our mind to intuit the future not merely say to deduce it or finally a faculty of our minds to stand in a community of thoughts with other men no matter how distant they may be these are concepts the possibility of which is entirely groundless because it cannot be grounded in experience and its known laws and without this it is an arbitrary combination of thoughts that although it contains no contradiction still can make no claim to objective reality thus to the possibility of the sort of object that one would here think as far as reality is concerned it is evidently intrinsically forbidden to think it in concreto without getting help from experience because it can only pertain to sensation as the matter of experience and does not concern the form of the relation that one can always play with in fictions cpr a b p for example of kant s always already unthink fictions i would like to suggest the experience of a rock concert in which a crowd knows the most popular song of the evening it could be liz phair doing a recent song stars and planets in which you know it s just the same old story stars rise and stars fall but the ones that shine the brightest aren t stars at all they re the planets just like us they re the planets that unite us and from big to small we all shine shine shine so we are

from dubiosity to admiration lost in a good book may be a painful rite of passage for a linear thinker here in author jasper fforde s england of people keep dodo birds as pets a special police unit drives stakes through vampires hearts tunbridge wells has been given over to russia in war reparations london to sydney travel time is minutes by gravitube through the earth s center air travel is by lighter thanair airship cheese is contraband there s a duty on custard homo sapiens neanderthalensis has been recreated from recovered dna and now provides society with its minimum wage untermenschen time travel is a reality and wooly mammoths in nine herds migrate back and forth across britain so little of this parallel universe makes sense that i at first doubted my ability to finish the book but intrepidly i carried on the heroine of the story is thursday next a literary detective in department of specops the national law enforcement megaforce the mission of so among other things is to validate the authenticity of recently discovered works by dead authors the title of the book refers to the ability of certain trained adepts to physically enter book plots in real time much as mary poppins and her young charges were able to pop in and out of chalk pavement pictures in the film mary poppins this talent is so rare that here next is coerced by a representative by the world s monolithic business corporation goliath to rescue his unsavory half brother previously marooned by thursday within the pages of poe s the raven in the first book of the next series the eyre affair in return goliath will restore thursday s husband landen who has been eradicated and as if that wasn t enough of a bother thursday must also thwart the imminent destruction of all life on earth by rampant strawberry flavored dream topping perhaps you can see where a linear thinker might suffer a migraine the enjoyment of becoming lost in lost in a good book isn t related to a nail biter plot because what plot it possesses isn t the word peripeteia comes to mind rather the joy comes from the expectation of reading what clever quirkiness the frisky imagination of fforde cranks out sort of a present day version of alice in wonderland indeed the cheshire cat is one of the book s characters it s that imagination that compels me to award the novel five stars though it goes against my grain im not particularly driven to read the eyre affair but i have ordered the next in the series the well of lost plots it will undoubtedly spend time in the waiting room with the twenty some more linear works awaiting my attention until i get the urge to lose myself in a bit of benign madness 
very good first book on jefferson if you have read several other books on tj then this is probably not for you this is a very concise page book that somehow covers his entire life in seemingly precise detail considering it s short length very well written and difficult to put down i also liked it because it seemed objective bernstein discusses some of the negative attributes that some viewed jefferson as having he also discusses the sally hemings issue at length great starter book on jefferson 
the first true report it is remarkable that in all the years of playboy this is the first book by someone who really wanted to be and was equipped to be a playboy playmate has told what it takes to be part of hef s inner circle and what is even more remarkable is that it appears that the author has written the book on her own describing how badly she wanted to be in that circle and what happened to her i applaud her honesty and openness 
the simple and the grandiose i have read a number of other books by shusaku endo and i have come to appreciate his unique to me christian theology he made a very powerful statement in silence and another one in deep river endo doesn t trumpet his points but they are clear nonetheless he is even more subtle in the samurai it doesn t take long for us to pick out a most unusual bad guy father velasco despite his continuous efforts to overcome his sinfulness depicts everything that is wrong with modern christianity i use the term modern christianity to refer to when the church became more important than the word as a counterpart we have rokuemon hasekura the title character he has no need whatsoever for chritianity but it is through his eyes that we are able to glimpse the true nature of christian faith the subtlety of the samurai lies in how the majesty of velasco s christianity overshadows the simple understanding of christianity that hasekura uncovers at times i thought endo had so lopsided the comparisons as to lose the meaning of it all only later did i realize the beautiful way that simplicity won out by its own nature i suppose it is possible to enjoy the samurai without being touched by this comparitve examination of christianity this is an excellent work of historical fiction that focuses on japan the new world spain and rome in the early s however for me the book challenged me to examine my own expression of faith both outwardly and inwardly and see if i was velasco or the samurai i m still in the process of that examination 
real people stepping out from an arthurian tapestry like many authors vera chapman tackles the daunting task of retelling and rounding out the characters of a well known story unlike most authors her retelling succeeds because it reads like her own story while you know how it must end you look forward to the fun of getting there the story is the tale of sir gawain and the green knight in which sir gawain meets a challenge of almost certain death however by some deft family history work which is completely possible to my knowledge she succeeds in making the characters her own whose personalities are new and whose attitudes are modern and easy to sympathize with while not being anachronistic what drew me into the story most though was the author s wonderful use of language she writes in a lush descriptive style which leaves the readers with as clear a picture as a medieval tapestry these vivid descriptions make the pages pass quickly and make the book impossible to put down luckily the book is s ! hort enough to make reading it in one long sitting possible since chapman also knows how to make her storytelling concise while maintaining the atmosphere of a royal court i highly recommend this book to anyone teenage or adult who loves to hear a good story being retold

different approach to relationships i used to think that if i just found the perfect way to do relationships i would never get hurt or have my heart broken lewis counters that kind of thinking love is vulnerable and you will get hurt he says and the only place you can fully escape from the dangers and perturbations of love is in hell this book helped me and i hope it will help you to break free from the mindset of seeking to avoid hurt in relationships and replace it with a desire to truly love other people we can never entirely avoid hurt or pain in relationships but if we approach relationships with the mindset of avoiding pain we will never experience the joy of true love but i digress lewis explains it so much better than i ever could this book s scope is not limited to one kind of relationship it is the four loves after all four kinds of love affection friendship eros and charity lewis truly goes through the whole gammut of love he covers what he calls the likings and loves for the sub human simple affection for other people and family the love that friends share romantic love and then god s love the fullest expression of love i think perhaps this is one of the best books on love and relationships for the two are inexplicably bound up in each other that i have ever read i don t think you will be able to read this book without being changed 
wasn t what i thought it would be my fault i was thinking this would be a book about places to sell your photography like post cards and bookmarkers or stuff like that i guess i just didn t look it over enough it is pretty much just basic stuff about how to run a business in photography some i thought were a little simple like it says you should have a seperate phone for your business also you should tell family members to not use that phone for anything other than business that would be true of any business be it photography or selling comic books some of it is good business practices that many would not think of but i think you could get a book on operating a home business or small business from the library and learn most of this stuff it is not an expensive book so i m not going to complain much i would suggest though that a person that is going to do photography work might think of staying with one or two areas and get books on those for example wedding photography and stock photography and learn how to make it in those areas go ahead and buy it if you don t like it you are not out much 
fantastic book as a police officer we spend many hours in various forms of training some of this training is dedicated to the rules surrounding the use of our department issued firearms some of this training is dedicated to the physical skill of firing this weapon none of the training is dedicated to what you go through after having actualy used this weapon against another human being in self defense the extent of my departments response was absolutely no critical incident debriefing and my appointment with the department phycologist occured days after the shooting the evaluation by the physcologist last minutes total at that point i knew that my well being was up to me to provide for after some research i located this series of books by dave grossman purchasing these books was the best thing i could have done for myself the information within these pages helped me understand all the stages of emotion that i was and still am going through i would recommend these books to anyone in the military or in lawenforcement or any family memeber there of they may very well have saved my sanity

authentic brazilian healers i read this book in during a trip to the us as i see the book here and i read some superficial opinions coming from randi s admirers i feel compelled to comment arigo was a well known healer in brazil his healing work through surgery allways free of charge went on for many years hundreds of people a day till he died in a car accident in john fuller s book writen after his visit to brazil with dr andrija puharich to meet talk to arigo and see personally what was happening around that healer work is a very good piece of research well documented anyone who is interested in phenomena that shows facts that science is far from explaining will get a precious source of information from john fuller s book even though skepticism comes about when we face cases like arigo there is an unending source of documentation about his life and the authenticity of his work scientists politicians wealthy people as well hundreds of thousands of simple people were operated by him superficial opinions from anyone who hasn t a clue about what they are talking will not invalidate cases so extensively proven true like arigo john g fuller s book is more than worth reading healers like arigo exist spread all over brazil anyone with time will and interest can do what mr fuller did so well research and write about them 
coyote has risen in the first book of the series coyote allen steele told us how the captain of the first interstellar colonizing ship alabama smuggled prisoners ofstate intellectual dissidents oppressed by a right wing authoritarian government on board and they stole the ship reached coyote a moon of a planet named bear circling ursae majorus in coyote rising things have gotten complicated on earth people are running out of living space the government has shifted to a collectivist a variant of socialism authoritarianism and technology has advanced to produce ever faster ships the result the original coyote colonists get a series of unwelcome visitors from earth flee the original colony to form a new colony on a neighboring island and a civil war begins to brew as with the first book this one originally appeared as a series of novellas in a science fiction magazine while there are still traces of disjointedness from turning a series of novellas into a novel the mild discontinuities did not interrupt the flow for me there is a larger cast of well developed characters here including the introduction of savants cyborgs with downloaded human minds and a religious mutant the terrain of coyote is well described as are the human interactions and there is plenty of action the fauna of coyote does not seem adequately developed ie there should be more animal species thanks to the friend who sent this to me jan dierckx i found this book gripping and thoroughly enjoyable i look forward to the next in the series 
emergence disguised i agree with most of your reviewers laughlins book is not nobelstuff but give a point it shows a laid back theorist who hasearned his prize already and is easing into another perhaps moreimportant area of physics in amongst his vignettes of personallife he is pointing ahead in the understanding of our cosmos all beyond physics scientific progress emphasizes emergence take for instance the guidance of dna in evolution i would in clude also the precise definition of the forces of nature any body out there with ideas to help this concept along 
very inspirational i read this book shortly after my daughter was born weeks approx days premature last april the stories dr remen recounts in her books were very inspirational and helped my husband and me to be there for our daughter during her month stay in the nicu i found it hard on some days to cope with my daughter s condition as it rollercoastered from not so bad to absolutely horrifying and reading the stories really helped put perspective in what we were going through i honestly don t think i would ve survived being a nicu mom without having read this book

you want a title not bloody likely i go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race the whole book is filled with stuff like this at first glance full of depth and meaning and at closer look fancy jibberish academia has praised this book for a number of reasons most notably its innovative stream of conciousness style critics and high school lit teachers alike seem to agree that james joyce is pretty great and this is one of his crowning achievements honestly i m not sure i see it the same way the book doesn t exist on its own plane of unqualified excellence as i had been led to believe many of the characters although based on real life counterparts lack depth and development a lot of this has to do with the entire book being presented from the main character s point of view so we are not allowed to see any other perspectives of the events that unfold in the novel a lot of the action doesn t really seem to add to the overall story either it does not appear that the main character grows from any of the situations or that they have much of an effect on later developments despite all of this i still enjoyed the book as should be evident by the star rating above i liked the book because of the first point i made about specious depth in the writing the book is written in its own highly esoteric language that i really got a kick out of that line i quoted earlier may not really mean anything on its own but it just sounds so damn pretty how can i resist it this book is certainly not for everybody and it takes soem getting used to for the first hundred pages or so but once you realize the plot doesn t matter a great deal you can relax and be swept away by the language as only joyce can command subvert it

making aromatherapy creams and lotions i really enjoyed the book i found that the book was explained in logical sequence with plenty of background information as to why you will use one oil over another depending on what your desire is the book is not one where you can flip through it and ah ! there s the recipe i want you will need to read and understand what donna maria is trying to teach you first and then mix up your own concoction however she does include many of her own favorites otherwise read the book and then pick your ingredients from each of the list similar to ordering from a chinese restaurant and chances are you will have a nice product i would write down your ingredients while you are making the product because it will probably come up quite well and you will have to sell it 
kids love to say no this book lets your child tell someone else no and is very empowering i bought it based on the reviews and was dissappointed when i read it to myself but sure enough my two year old loves it as much as everyone else s kid did it s her first pick book at reading time 
a must read for a long time i ve felt that this book should be required reading for every american high school student the book details the campaigns of the u s marines in the pacific war it neither villifies the japanese nor glorifies the marines the author merely presents the events in a relatively objective manner but in such a compelling way that if it doesn t grip your heart and bring tears to your eyes at times then you re just not human wheeler presents the events of the campaigns he shows both the mistakes and the heroism he presents the facts as they affected the man in the trenches not as they appeared to the generals and the admirals this book is very inspiring the men he talks about were real people rich men working men poor men they were all men who had nothing to gain and everything to lose some came back home and some didn t it challenged me personally but i can t quite explain it without sounding trite you just have to read the book every american should read this book 
a nightmarish testimony this book is the fascinating memoir of eugenia semyonova ginsburg who lived through the reign of terror that was unleashed by stalin from onwards ginsburg is an excellent author who clearly articulates the progress of her decent into madness of the purges this book starts in the late s when ginsburg began to be implicated by association in antiparty activity although she had been a strong supporter of communism and stalinism her past activities would serve no good in the madness to come it follows her from the initial interrogations the prisons right through to the gulag this is an amazing life story one which i would never wish to experience and will keep you glued to this book until the end i really was fascinated by the depth of understanding that she carried while going through the events that she did i was really intrigued by her exposure of how logic and wisdom went out the window as communism blinded the eyes of the populous to turn on each other in such a brutal way 
great book wonderful pictures and great engine exploration photos well done 
true ww ii story from a different perspective this book is fascinating as it ties in a captured american pilot s story with that of the french underground a sobering view of the stranglehold the germans had on occupied france and the tragic and heroic struggle of ordinary people 
more than what it promises this is more than a look at the development of the urban organization it s an examination of society as a whole this is one of the few books that actually covers all intresting areas of human social developmen i e political science religion sociology anthropology economics etc the book more than tells the story of the cities development it explains why today s society functions in the way it does 
i wish it would have been required in being a non traditional student i needed this years ago this would have uncovered the mystery of college for me as a teenager and explained so much that college courses just do not offer to freshmen i will hand this down to my children and encourage any parent to purchase it for all high school seniors

another good sams sams again turns out a great home manual for working with a complex product 
buy the earlier edition great book but the cover is insulting a pile of quarters how does that represent ayn rand s message the earlier edition had striking gloriously stylized inspiring art on the cover this one has a plain naturalistic pile of quarters to represent the vision of an idealist and a passionate romantic if ayn were alive she d read the publisher the riot act over this cover 
good read i really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series if you are a fan of dean koontz you will not be disappointed i give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in but well worth the wait whew what a ride 
finding fish finding fish by antwone fisher is a passionate and heart wrenching look into the life of the author as a ward of the state thankfully he escapes the terrors of his childhood and eventually finds success fisher writes with a distinctive voice he is able to convey the emotions of the young boy he portrays in the memoir rather than telling the story through the voice of an adult the memoir is an honest and shocking look into the world of an orphan without anyone to protect him his father had been shot two months before his birth and his mom is in prison throughout his life with the picketts his foster parents antwone is forced through horrific events that are painful to read about he is molested at a young age by a babysitter beaten mentally abused and treated like a ghost he becomes reserved and shy lacking love and the comfort of a family even worse his social workers are sadly oblivious to the abuse because the picketts are able to transform into respectable and polite adults when in public remarkably antwone braves through his torturous childhood as well as homelessness for a short time and finds himself in the navy this becomes his miracle and inspires him to do more with his life he finds himself traveling around the world educating himself about different cultures as well as teaching himself english with the help of a thesaurus in comparison to his childhood antwone is in paradise this transition from a hopeless child with no allies in the world to a strong successful navy officer illustrates a major theme in the memoir no matter how horrible somebody s life is with perseverance and hope it is possible to achieve anything although antwone is thrown into a terrible life he finds his own success and thankfully escapes his past and finds happiness this book is an emotional rollercoaster and any reader will become attached to antwone rooting for him against the negativity in his life

another exemplary title in the missing manual series even iphoto veterans will appreciate the excellent coverage of new features offered in iphoto over previous versions of iphoto the first part of this book goes outside the iphoto application itself and presents the basics of digital photography with brief discussions of camera selection terminology and image capture techniques in roughly pages nice for a digital photography newbie but fluff for those who already own any one of a multitude of books on digital camera photography parts and cover the majority of iphoto s features in enough depth and detail to represent the missing manual moniker perfectly this is great for relative newcomers to iphoto but some chapters will seem like a re hash of the basics to an iphoto veteran part s chapters cover the sweet spot of iphoto s new features and their integration within the ilife suite of products it also makes a compelling case for purchase of ilife if you don t already have it some of the most valuable information for the beginner and experienced user alike can be found in the sidebar topics that cover gotcha s faq s and power user tips these are sprinkled throughout the book and keep the reader s interest part covers more advanced topics like using iphoto to generate desktop backgrounds correctly automation scripting and file management i was hoping for much more depth on creative ways of using automator and applescript with iphoto but then again this isn t a book on applescript or automator the last chapter on iphoto file management skips talking about one of the biggest mistakes that many iphoto users make that is mucking around with the iphoto library files by renaming relocating and deleting files and folders directly in the finder thus breaking the iphoto database from a troubleshooter s standpoint i d like to see the authors advise readers to resist the temptation to do this it d make a nice sidebar to their core discussion of managing iphoto libraries and archiving the appendix covers techniques to recover and or rebuild the iphoto database once broken and misbehaving this book is a great reference to have at your side when working in iphoto especially when using it as part of an ilife workflow highly recommended 
some fascinating material david lazar is some kind of renaissance man all his own his other books include conversations with mfk fisher fisher is a talent of such a different sort than michael powell s that all we can say about david lazar s taste is the word eclectic lazar reprints and in some cases prints for the first time some great interviews of powell who s always sparkling and seems to be on in the great tradition of peter ustinov ie a born interviewee the brilliant film director oliver assayas asks perhaps the most probing questions whereas martin scorcese who is a special guest star in one of the interviews doesn t really seem like much of an intellectual does he he lobs off all the questions and continually defers to powell as the one with the brains the only trouble with these interviews is the amount of repetition from questions that powell has answered many times it s interesting to find out that john sweet the american serviceman who plays basically himself in a canterbury tale never made another film but went back to his home town in the states entered the business world and years later showed up at a tribute to pressburger and powell with his family in tow a happy man but then when you hear much the same story again you lose interest fast ditto with the repetitions of the same answers about knowing hitchcock winston churchill etc and what about the condescending way he refers to chinatown as a studio movie unworthy of the genius of polanski clearly he hated chinatown and he certainly minces no words about new york new york horrible film with liza 
a good introduction to torts this is a pretty good book better than many st year law casebooks dobbs has organized the material well and it s all interesting stuff to know torts is the class that most people think about when they think lawyerthe material covers intentional torts battery assualt trespass etc negligence defamation and more there are a few grammatical errors maybe per pages but i think a lot of reviewers let their hatred for torts affect their reviews all in all i think this is a great l textbook better than any emmanuel s outline i would recommend dobb s law of torts as a supplement though these two books work best together

provides actual info first off i have to say i hate the name and this is the only dummies book i have ever bought when things are too difficult for people to use it is the designer who is at fault not the user there i feel better after reading many reviews of many wireless network books at amazon i bought this one i had tried on a couple occasions to get a wireless network going at home without success i had wireless internet but could not share files or printers there are maybe two pages of information in this book that revealed everything i needed to successfully advance from internet only to a real network and i could easily find and understand the information ! the book has much more info as well but i had already figured out the other settings and had other sources for the technical background info i don t mean to belittle this with the two page comment there are few how to books i have found that have more than that i am very glad i bought it five stars if it did not have an insulting title 
well written this is a very easy book to read about one of our most interesting presidents 
the most profound book i ve ever read this book blew me away tolstoy explains the cause of conflicts between divergent theories of life the intrinsic hypocrisy of life in modern society the futility of force based solutions and the nature of man s search for personal truth he proposes a radical change in social order based on christ s sermon on the mount most people recommend you read the last chapter first but i plowed right through the tedious beginning and found it relevant to my thoughts at the time perhaps i discovered this book at exactly the right time in my life but my life will never be the same i recommend this book to anyone who is seeking higher truth outside of organized religion or trying to reconcile science and religion

i get a good feeling from this book if you consider yourself an advanced witch or wiccan you may want to be less harsh in your judgment of this book as the people reading it are those like myself who have an avid interest in witchcraft the occult but don t have the twenty years of training in such subjects so in that case i ve made my point clear i am not saying that this book is poorly written or contrived on that contrary it s a very rich book and i think it is chock full of important information i would highly recommend this book of course to those who need a teacher and ann moura is just this person her book is quite replete as i mentioned and i get a good feeling from it for some reason i also wanted to note that i especially loved that ann included sections on magical teas and other aspects of the occult like the symbols of planetary spirits and so forth this book has it all 
a good help to the series it presents many interesting info about the begining of the series so you could read about the casting processes of course it has a good explanation of the main chapters over the years the only bad thing about it is that the photos are b w

marketing simplicity want to sell more of your product want to know how to market effectively then you need to get this book as a constant reader i find that thinner books offer so much more than larger books why thinner books condense information into easy to understand rules laws and principles al ries breaks down the rules of successful marketing down to just laws and he does a great job of explaining each how much easier can that be and you only need to remember just a few of them to market successfully and though this book was not written to tell you exactly how you are going to make your product sell more it will tell you your goals and destinations this is the first book any marketer should read only then does it make sense to read the rest gus maximusthe art of gamefarethe art of winning at multiplayer video gameswww theartofgamefarecom 
the definitive biography i read ferling s biography of adams after reading mccullough s john adams i was a bit disappointed with a few aspects and thought reading ferling would round out my knowledge of our second president i wasn t disappointed ferling s masterly and scholarly work provides an outstanding insight into adams his activities his motivations and his relationship with his wife abigail in particular ferling pulls no punches in describing some of adams rather significant character flaws particularly his burning ambition and his subsequent abandonment of his family in pursuit of it richly footnoted the work still remains the biography of adams despite mccullough s recent work and its ny times bestseller status 
the truth about disco thank you tim lawrence this book is the antedote to all the haters out there who still believe that disco sucks after the post comiskey park backlash this book is such an amazing and wonderfully readable document that i would recommend anyone interested in th century american musical history or the black urban experience of the s or relatively recent new york history read it of course if you re interested in disco music or dance music the book is absolutely essential this book goes much deeper than the usual studio cliches that people associate with the genre although studio is included of course and discusses the origins of the sound and the largely unhearalded people who made this scene happen david mancuso is described as a pivotable person here and the folks who were there will confirm it the book begins in his legendary club the loft and lovingly details his obsession with sound and the disco experience other innovators from the early s are also featured including francis grasso steve d acquisto bob casey and many more the scene is chronicaled from humble beginnings through the glory years of the mid s and ends the decade with the backlash in full swing in mainstream culture but continuing to thrive in clubs like paradise garage and better days along the way you meet producers like walter gibbons and tom moulton who made some of the classic recordings of the era and lawrence takes the time to explain what is so remarkable about their work you also get delightfully naughty stories about some of the key players in the scene including dj s artists and of course the patrons that illustrate some of the excesses of the time personally i think that it s this superb combination of detailed research and bitchy gossip that makes the book so thoroughly readable and fun i loved reading this book the only drawback for me was that i couldn t help pining for the days when new york club culture was this incredible before aids and rudy guilliani conspired to very nearly kill it off fortunately they weren t entirely successful highly recommended !

forty blend shapes brilliant concepts and discussion of details but somewhat slow in painting the big picture he never really comes out and says it so i will the end result is a control rig for blend shapes each painstakingly hand drawn and tuned the state of the art doesn t allow shortcuts i don t think it ever can or will if you can accept that all shapes are needed to model the range of human facial expression this book is for you osipa makes a compelling argument that each is necessary guides you through the modeling to make it possible and wraps up with an elegant rig to control and manage them all the result is a talking head simply amazing in its range and control of nuance still heads per character is a huge investment is it worth doing right or can you continue to fake it buy the book play with the rig and find out for yourself

valuable book on gorky lader has done an excellent job of delineating gorky s work the color reproductions are fair they are not top of the line but then very few books on gorky have good repros i find the back sections on gorky s theory and his techniques interesting gorky states his case that he is a classical artist his interest in the old masters backs this up such as ucello an index and these special sections help to look things up when you want to review his ideas and ambitions for art the paperback edition will serve you well it is light enough to put in your kit bag and carry it with you something that gorky deserves

well okay you should keep it i hope you are familiar with the series if not start with the first book temping danger this latest book blood lines the third in the series will leave you baffled author wilks takes you on a ride though a maze of multiple avenues to the plot that will be a little taxing for those of us that have little patience the jumping around from character to character was a little annoying i still feel in the dark about the bad goddess thing i personally didn t like the fact that the author changed the strength of the main female charactor lily into this brainwashed government agent that is stupid enough to think everything is solved with a gun and badge lily doesn t know enough about her mate or his culture to bust a grape i was equally revolted by the fact that lily thinks it s ok to give the u s government the codex a book of knowledge give the book to a group that were going to shoot dragons from the sky and i really wish she would stop her secondary charactors from functioning in denial that is old if you are a fan of author wilks of course you enjoyed her book i enjoyed it i just don t want to see a good author go bad i will await the next one just not with a hurry up frame of mind as i would some authors

an eye opener indeed professor karsh is phenomenal he understands islamic history much better than any of my moslem professors the book does trace the history of islam from its inception while it is difficult for a moslem to see the prophet criticized we are not allowed to criticize any prophet including christian and jewish ones i have to admit it is hard to challenge the author he is factual and analytical he writes remarkably well most impressive is his possession of enormous facts while it will never happen i believe he should be invited to al azhar and be listened to we muslims are not sufficiently critical of our past 
an honest truth seeker to anyone with even minimal objectivity it s no secret major media outlets are biased and have been for decades but why bernard goldberg answers that question in a straightforward way goldberg s perspective gives him an insight few have the privilege of sharing i e that of an industry insider a cbs correspondent for years so what s the mystery why does bias exists in major media organizations goldberg says it s environment i e groupthink the herd mentality peer pressure decision makers in those organizations come from privileged backgrounds they hear conversations from like minded colleages and assume their slant on issues are mainstream however any objective inquiry shows that the opinions of georgetown and manhattan are not shared by the average thinking person elsewhere in the country goldberg offers a creative drastic solution leave manhattan get out and have your assumptions challenged in the marketplace of ideas he admits that secretly some journalists admit this is the way the system operates but because they have careers and families they don t speak out another bold issue golberg addresses is the idea of special interest groups shaping news content with agendas that are more concerned with their constituencies than providing information to the public network decision makers cowardly acquiesce and journalism is compromised he cites case after case editors intentionally leave out signficiant details of news stories so they might not offend certain groups golberg courageously goes where few dare he has the spirit of a true inquirer a real journalist he s looking for answers and is willing to point the finger at some blatant abuses in concluding his book he argues that if the media want to be taken seriously again they ve got to address these issues these matters can t be ignored if credibility is the objective or a reporter or an organization

a novel so unique doctorow probably invented a new genre in publishing it ragtime is the story of various levels of american society in about the first decade of the th century a period doctorow dubs the age of ragtime after the popularity of the music scott joplin and other composers are writing at this time in this curious novel we meet real and invented people interacting on a taut little stage here we find harry houdini evelyn nesbit henry ford j p morgan harry thaw booker t washington and other famous and infamous men and women from this time and we also meet some archetypal constructs known to us by such designations as father younger brother mother etc there is the upper class white family from new rochelle headed by an explorer father there is the ambitious hard working jewish family new to america s shores headed by a kind hearted man whose brain teems with ideas for inventions and there is a black family composed of an unwed father and mother a ragtime pianist and a young woman who is eventually taken in by the white family and an infant son the bulk of the story of ragtime trickles through the lives of these people and passes notoriously through passion fueled murder bigotry accidental killings social glory revolutionary schemes and acts of justifiedterrorism ragtime moves so far away from the plot of its beginnings it is impossible to predict its destination a reader merely hangs on for the bumpy wavering ride through our american nation in its teenaged years 
haunting ending i thoroughly enjoyed this book as with all of ms didion s books i take my time with them to truly cherish her writing style i am a huge fan of her use of characterization as well as her use of grammer besides this book i regularly recommend play it as it lays and miami two other great books by ms didion everytime i think of this book i think of how the brave narrator in the course of the developments of the novel regrets with the last line in the book the opening statement she made in the book s lead one of the all time best books i ve ever read you have got to give this book a read too 
review of feisty fido feisty fido presents a clear step bystep method for changing the behavior of a dog who is aggressive toward strange dogs when he is being walked on leash it was not as clear on changing the behavior of a dog who is intermittently agressive toward other dogs he lives with 
a timely plea for restored intent contrary to the views espoused by the previous reviewer come to the table is a felicitous call to imbue our time of communing around the lords table with all that it was intended whilst i take issue with much of gallantknights review in my assessment he correctly notes several things it is indeed a scholarly presentation but it is far from unreadable and quite engaging at times much of dr hicks points are indeed based on old testament precedent and rightly so hicks ably brings to bear the covenental symbolism jesus purposefully gives the lord s supper from its relationship to the passover in particular to the relationship between altar sacrifice and the ensuing table fellowship this book offers much insight into the desire of god for communion with and among his people hicks historical survey of meals in both the old and the new testaments is a highlight of the book and provides the structure for most of it his exegesis of pertinent passages is accurate as noted but the discerning reader will struggle to find examples of ignoring context inspite of gallantknight s warnings i find it strange that he would list hicks treatment of acts as an example of denying context when the author s exposition of this verse was based solely on the immediate context those who would deny a reference to the lord s supper in that particular verse must wrest it from the text to disallow the clear flow of thought and terminology found in verse in this book hicks unapologetically presents an image of the lord s supper that stands in stark dissonance to the practice of most contemporary traditions this in several ways is a brave move for someone with a heritage in the restoration movement as it invites criticism like that from gallantknights motives impugned and monikers like changeagent cast what on earth is changeagent language it must have been too subtle for me to pick up ! the strength of this book lies not so much in uniqueness more and more scholars acknowledge the early practice of a fellowship meal lord s supper but in its call for a thorough rethink of firstly the theological foundation of the ls it s purpose and how that is reflected in our modern practice if it is at all come to the table is not without its weaknesses dr hicks i think was quite aware of most of them when he penned the preface and detailed its purpose some more groundwork for the practice of the early church could have been detailed but where that was light hick s leaves a healthy bibliography for further study

an interesting look at how money gets distributed in the us andrew hacker s money is a great look at who has the money in america and how they got it he talks in great detail about how the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor i was astounded to read that in there were individuals who claimed over billion in income almost tax returns claimed an income of at least million there are far more rich people out there than i thought and it leads me to believe that if they can do it so can i 
good starting point as someone else stated this is a good starting point for getting acquainted with serial killers one other review says you can get all the same information on the internet by using a search engine that is true you can probably get more information using a search engine however there are serial killers in this book i never knew about and therefore could not find them via a search engine this covers killers from all over the world and spanning many generations it is a definite read for people who are new to researching serial killers and would like to have a good reference as we all know encyclopedias are just that a reference so this is a beginning and a reference and once you find a subject in this book that draws your interest you should then get a more detailed account to read overall i rate this as a very good book with good basic information yes some things are out of date but the son of sam is not one of them the green river killer is however as gary leon ridgeway is not even mentioned as a suspect however the book was last released in and the grk was captured in

excllent resource this book is a must if you are an ambituos dyi r installing a hyrdronic heating system in your home the book is a text book used for educating hvac people and engineers it covers everything that you could possibly need to know about this type of heating i definitly would not have attempted to install the system without understanding all the variables in designing an efficient and balanced hydronic system the free information on the web doesn t cut it in my opinion 
good cable modem technology tutorial as a non expert in the field broadband cable tv access networks is a very complete book that is well organized and full of information the introduction sections are very clear and setup up the rest of the book very well it is clear that shlomo is an expert in the field and also a very good writer that integrates difficult concepts into a readable story on areas that shlomo is not an expert in the descriptions are not so complete sometimes the book moves too quickly through the details but the amount of material in the book is impressive for its size overall this is a very good book that holds the reader s interest 
excellent star wars ok so the book starts out a little slow but i must say that is because the book is written from the first person stand point the only starwars book i know of to be written from that perspective this story follows corran horn from stockpole s xwing series on his journey to become a jedi knight corran s wife mirax is missing and in order to find her he must come to terms with his heritage so he changes his name to keiran halycon and joins luke skywalker s jedi academy as one of his first students the story goes right along with the jedi academy trilogy and then precedes after exar kun s defeat to corran leaving the academy for his own reasons he doesnt like how luke runs the academy it doesnt work for him to continue his search for his wife but in order to save her he must make a choice join the dark side or lose her forever you will have to read the book to find out what happens there but if you know anything at all about star wars you know everything usually works out in the end 
new approach to spending habits i could see myself and other members of my family and friends in the book as i read and within minutes had gotten a pencil to underline passages this is a new and innovative approach to why we handle money in the way we do i think this will help us spend more wisely in the futur 
fabulous cultural analysis with wide implications spiral dynamics possesses a childish charm that is typically absent in any study of such intellectual depth at the core spiral dynamics is a heirarchical holarchical evolution of values motivations and drives these are widely applicable in business sociology anthropology politics and foreign policy the initial theorems were concocted by the late clare graves and his two predecessors beck and cowan have not only adapted these profound analyses to a broader nonacademic audience but have added a unique flavor of their own now i have friends who have been mildly exposed to spiral dynamics and they re immediately put off by the color scheme with a puritanical disgust for anything with such an unintellectual resemblance on top of that the kiddie analogies even make the reader feel quite well admittedly juvenile at times but the beautiful thing is these are serious and profound discoveries with wide implications as been shown by beck and cowan s social and cultural work around the planet these simplistic representations of such dynamic and deep material helps the student understand the points and quickly push to deeper and more pertinent questions for instance instead of saying the membership driven meme desiring conformity and sociocentric awareness it s much easier to say the blue meme on top of that the book leaves an open end with the mathematical structure of the spiral which has interesting implications as far as patterns of evolution are concerned in whatever medium they occur enough of the mumbo jumbo highly recommended 
very interesting but requires some skimming the thesis of this book is that warfare has always been an aspect of the human condition and that it was as frequent and as deadly in pre historic times as in recorded history the book relies on two types of evidence archeological and ethnographic archeological evidence can attest to the existence of warfare not the frequency but the distinction is lost another distinction not properly made is between peoples who fight defensive wars and aggressive wars keeley devotes entirely too much time to arguing with early th century scholars and the tendency of more recent scholars to ignore evidence in order to maintain that war was primarily a function of civilization ironically keeley frequently cites a study of yanomomo indians discredited by kenneth good s wonderful book into the heart good did not find the aggression his mentor had declared existed having said all this if the reader is willing to skim at times this is a very interesting book it provides insight into how war was waged the causes of war psychology of the peoples involved and what warfare implies as regards the human animal it adds to the discussion on wars between primitives and europeans found in jared diamond s pulitzer prize winning book guns germs and steel keeley makes a fascinating contrast between indian white conflicts in the us west vs the canadian west and the causes of this difference

a good mystery for victorian lit lovers i really liked this book it had a romantic appeal and vivid memorable characters the plot was also fantastic wilkie wrapped up everything quite nicely at the end i won t say anymore for those who haven t read it i didn t feel there were any unbelievable coincidences in the plot it was a little slow at first but once i got into it i couldn t put it down some parts were hilarious this book has it all i would definitely recommend it 
an argument for noblesse obliege dr zakaria s the future of freedom is both brilliant and disturbing there is much that i agree with in his analysis of democracy that a strong and vibrant middle class is necessary in order for a genuine democracy to exist and flourish and that a free market economy is instrumental in supporting democratic institutions and vice versa however i was disturbed by the larger argument zakaria makes that democratic institutions need un democratic safeguards to protect it from the fickle will of the people using examples of failed democracies around the world and across time nazi germany immeadiately comes to mind zakaria claims that the elite the well educated and wealthy should rule the better to prevent the more purlient elements of society and the elected officials chosen by them from undermining democracy the disintegration of democracies in east europe and latin america are held up as examples of what happens without the enlighted rule of the elite this argument is not new as zakaria admits in the united states it dates back to the founding of the nation as adams and jefferson fought over competing visions of who should rule zakaria provides new material and brilliant analysis to support his position while i do not agree with his conclusions it is still a worthwhile read especially in light of our nation building abroad and the democratic debate at home recommended 
an excellent tale of clashing cultures john donohue s deshi is an excellent tale of clashing cultures an exquisitely flavored and nuanced mystery featuring college professor martial arts expert connor burke a character whose background mirrors the author s own as in donohue s first book sensei burke is asked by the new york city police to help them investigate a difficult case this time it s the murder of a japanese american whose death seems to have something to do with a missing inka a traditional japanese scroll indicating accomplishment or enlightenment at the behest of his sensei teacher burke also becomes involved with a lama who has fled oppression in his native tibet but is still in danger is it possible that the two cases are related although the publisher of deshi japanese for student bills the novel as a martial arts thriller it is much more than that true it has its share of action and suspense but donohue s story is also one of insight and reflection written by an author who understands the dichotomy between east and west and uses that knowledge to flavor his already compelling prose 
great perspective for younger children a very simplistic but impacting look at maps from a me mine perspective beginning with her room house street all the way to world and then back to room the theme is everyone has a special place in the world and this is how you ll find me using a map the illustrations of the map are very vague in terms of detail but gives a great relative perspective of the area it comprises it will introduce the younger children and provide a more vivid explanation to the older ones i would recommend ages k th grades 
excellent thumbnail sketches of most philosophers i would recommend this book for the reader who wants to have a ready source of information available to him about topics in philosophy and particular philosophers that he may encounter in his general reading of books dealing with history social science and biography some of the thumbnail sketches are too brief and a few contain incorrect information for instance the discussion of the principle of indifference poi references chapter of j m keynes s a treatise on probability this chapter includes a brief summary of the poi howeverthe main discussion of the poi occurs in chapter not chapter see p the discussion of john maynard keynes contains an error nowhere in the general theory does keynes suggest or recommend a countercyclical fiscal policy based on deficit finance in the period keynes did analyse and support the concept of a capital account separated from the rest of the government budget that would deal with the financing of long lived infrastructure public sector projects that would pay for themselves over the life time of the project only these types of projects would be initially funded by government borrowing see p 
a must read zinn s history is a must read for every american who has any pretense of being educated the author cuts through the myhths and half truths that usually pass for legitimate history and offers a myriad of facts and insights that give a fuller and more complete picture of what american history is really all about 
demonstrates a difficult concept well we use this book and its predecessor me on the map to teach map concepts in first grade children this age generally have difficulty with the quotnestingquot idea of these things that you can be in a county state country continent on a planet and in a solar system all at once these books do a good job of making this more tangible and easier to grasp it is especially effective when students do a re write following the reading and personalize it to their own place on the map 
wonderful this is a wonderful compilation of verses illustrated with wonderful art by mary englebreit it is so enjoyable ! 
perhaps a personal bias between planets is yet another suberb heinlein classic one that doesn t leave you hanging in the middle as much as some of his works the technological ideas are a little outdated of course but the storyline itself is masterful heinlein had a perfect grasp as to what motivates humans to make the decisions that they do in times of crisis a definite recommended read for all heinlein fans in my opinion 
john o neill is a modern hero i bought this book on sale at k mart and it was definitely worth the few dimes i spent for it this book reads like a novel fast and furious not much down time if you don t know about john o neill a true hero or martyr in this case then you need to read this book yes o neill has his faults dont we all he is definitely a ladies man and has three ladies plus an undivorced marriage on the string and he becomes forgetful and loses things that almost cost him his job but hey that s only two negatives compared to the positives this guy was made of his story is a compelling statement made against our current president and his predecessors that did not follow up on his predictions that al qaeda would strike again and again to top it off he even predicted his own death in the twin towers the day before if you don t read this book then you don t care how terrorists have us under their grip and won t let go 
a tragedy of manners the book tells the sad tale of lily bart living in new york at the end of the th century her fate appears so real merciless and inevitable because edith wharton s family history was acquired with the great names of the old new york society the author manages to create a protagonist who at twenty nine is already past the age of marriage which would be her only chance to secure a safe and comfortable future but her character is complex and contradictory and the causes for her destruction lie within her own psyche that is why she manages to cut herself at every turn by a combination of lack of judgement lack of care and a great deal of arrogance towards the men who show interest in her and so her decline misstep after misstep appears both gradual and inevitable the author remarkably shows the social claustrophobia under which lily bart suffers she evolves in an airless world of tight corsets heavy draperies and closed rooms where she attempts to gasp for fresh air but fails and suffocates she doesn t acknowledge that a woman of her class and situation can only support herself through an advantageous marriage edith wharton clearly both disapproves of the wealth of the very rich and portrays them as inevitable because such people are invincible lily bart is the agent of her own decline since she refuses to bargain with them in order to triumph in this sense she is finally a victim because she cannot resolve the conflict between her ideals and her comfort or between what she aspires to be and what society insists she becomes 
larry brown fay contemporary candide unusual and gripping story of the underebelly south larry brown is a superb writer for any serious reader 
the classic novel of gettysburg michael shaara s the killer angels is well known to a couple of generations of american army officers for whom it has been required professional reading it is also well known to many fans of the civil war as the basis for the movie gettysburg it may be with anton myrer s once an eagle one of the best novels on the american way of war sometimes fiction does a better job of explaining what happened than conventional history does the killer angels may be proof of that truism shaara has suceeded in capturing the key events of the epic battle of gettysburg he has also suceeded in humanizing some of the principal personalties the reader can appreciate what gettysburg must have been like for confederate commander robert e lee and his stalwart corps commander james longstreet and for union officers john buford and joshua chamberlain we see the unfolding battle through the eyes of these four individuals and a host of other leaders shaara was generally faithful to the historical record when he wrote in his story is fictional to the extent that we are privy to the unrecorded thoughts and feelings of the men around whom shaara builds his narrative we see these men as the human beings they were not the semi mythic historical personalties or in some cases the forgotten men they have become in a series of well written vignettes shaara relates the story of the battle in one union cavalry commander john buford recognizes the key terrain at gettysburg and holds it until the arrival of union infantry in another joshua chamberlain defends the extreme left of the union line in an action that will win him the medal of honor and enduring fame for the th maine confederate general lee struggles to reorient his army to fight an unexpected battle to which his absent cavalry commander did not alert him in several vignettes confederate general longstreet struggles against his military instincts as he carries out the orders of general lee their efforts to make sense of the chaos of the battlefield to lead their soldiers make tough decisions and deal with their hopes and fears hold lessons for us in the present day shaara s prose is highly readable authentic to the period even page turningthis book is highly recommended to students of the civil war and the military art readers without background in the civil war and the battle of gettysburg may find the narrative somewhat challenging to follow 
a father s opinion i bought this book for my daughter and think it s excellent there are lots of sample problems ranging from easy to difficult answers contain explanations which is what i really find helpful although explanations are not always easy to understand i haven t seen other books but i don t feel like i need to look 
i ve loved this novel for years i read it at least once a year i love the story the atmosphere and the characters including andrea the main character many reviewers here have found her off putting and she certainly is at first she s selfish opinionated and abrasive not to put too fine a point on it but she evolves the sharp tongue doesn t completely go away but she softens love for martin softens her and although she doesn t submit to it willingly it happens all the same there s a haunting incident at the end in which she recognizes and repudiates the way she s tried to control jim her brother has tried to clip his wings metaphorically speaking it sickens her and she draws back from it her personal growth is one of the reasons i like this book so much 
a rich part of this bilingual canadian s heritage volume land of black gold destination moon explorers on the moon this is the fifth instalment of my reviews of each of the seven volumes land of black gold makes little use of captain haddock it actually took form before the crab with the golden claws and is subjectively of course the weakest of all the tintin adventures created after tintin in america the third of the three double adventures destination moon and explorers on the moon show an amazingly detailed lunar effort years before the real moon landing using syldavia vs its communist style rival borduria see king ottokar s sceptre as the backdrop we see a side of calculus that we had not suspected a great deal of slapstick from haddock highly convincing moonscapes somewhat drab colours however but an effective layout the moonscapes are outstanding tintin s friendship with haddock requires a little tough love great stories and yet exceeded by the last two in the preceding volume and the three in volume 
enjoying this book is no accident i ve always enjoyed books about family and everyday life i feel books that can convey a sense of reality to a reader hold far more importance and reach a depth that any other book could ever wish for enter the accidental tourist by anne tyler i read this book during a dry spell in life when i was fed up with life and finding my life too ordered and predictable i know you may be thinking well what s wrong with that i felt a need for something more that s when i met macon leary macon is a travel writer who pens book for the accidental tourist an accidental tourist could best be defined as a travel minimalist they exclude almost every chance at fun and try to make sure their comfort zone goes with them on a trip he or she orders his or her life and never takes a chance for fear of it being far too risky beginning to sound familiar with his life and marriage reaching the end due mainly to the death of his young son macon meets muriel pritchett she is his opposite in every way but for some reason he can t stop the attraction i won t give much more away but know that this is ultimately a love story but it is not the typical fall head over heels kind it shows macon making real choices in a real world based on very certain and uncertain consequences at the end you may say what a fool or you may stand and applaud i won t let out which way i went im sure you will enjoy this journey by a master story teller like anne tyler the novel combines humor family life death love and choice in a way like no other i hope you enjoy ! 
comic art this book was so impressive we were glad we bought it for our friend ! she loves it and didn t put it down all day after receiving it 
brilliantly skewers leftwing cant fawning references grandiose quotations and outright nonsense fashionable nonsense is the funniest book that i have ever read sokal s account of post modern abuses of godel s theorem launched me into fits of laughter that even now threaten my ability to type this review sokal s ability to emulate the post modern way of writing will amuse and astound you as when he writes in his hoax paper the pi of euclid and the g of einstein are now perceived in their ineluctable historicity brilliant this book is the cyrano de bergerac of post modern philosophy quipping sensibly about nonsense while skewering the heart of post modern thought having died a silly death at sokal s hands let us hope post modernism never returns to pester us 
excellent unbiased and well documented overview this book was on the syllabus of professor zachary lockman s course on israel and palestine at harvard where i first learned of it it is extremely well documented unbiased and comprehensive and is also a very easy read one of the most interesting aspects of the book is its documentation of early zionists use of terrorist tactics which palestinians have more recently begun to use although some readers criticize the book as unbiased it is difficult to make that claim since the book is meticulously documented and relies heavily on israeli and historical documents and newspaper archives 
great help for my linguistics research i found this analytical dictionary very well done and accessible what is more it was of great help in my research for my linguistics analysis class in which we studied nahuatl in an exercise i recommend this book to whoever would like to learn more about this language and also to linguists

an intelligent read on one level this novel is a whodunnit we are following the trial of a fisherman accused of killing another fisherman but since one is japanese american and the other white the book is also an examination of racial bigotry and hatred it is set in the american north west among a strawberry growing and fishing community torn apart by wwii and the internment of japanese americans there is a love story a vivd and visceral description of being a soldier in wwii and the narrator s slow decline into loneliness and professional failure but the book scores highest when is shows us how fear turns to mistrust and mistrust to injustice and hatred all without becoming preachy 
a rendezvous with the origin of species the ancestor s tale a pilgrimage to the dawn of evolutionrichard dawkins s the ancestor s tale is remarkable on several levels as a scientific tour de force as a literary accomplishment and a personal statement at a time when the evolution v creationism dialogue continues unabated propelled by books like frances collin s the language of god dawkins makes a reasoned defense of evolution and rejection of intelligent design but it is in his creative use of examples from nature that he contributes the most taking a cue from chaucer s the canterbury tales he brings us back through geologic time eras epochs periods and so forth to the development and evolution of species for instance the beaver is the only species that builds dams and has the damn building gene whether or not the beaver is in a pond or lake dam building is hard wired in the brain he writes i have seen a remarkablefilm of captive beavers imprisoned in a bare unfurnished cage with no waterand no wood the beavers enacted in a vacuum all the stereotyped movements normally seen in natural building behavior when there is real wood and realwater they seem to be placing virtual wood into a virtual dam wall patheticallytrying to build a ghost wall with ghost sticks all on the hard dry flat floor oftheir prison one feels sorry for them it is as if they are desperate to exercisetheir frustrated dam building clockwork p dawkins has a remarkable ability to translate pure scientific theory into concrete instances of evolutionary change from the dawn literally of time he constructs a clear cohesive pattern of life at over pages the ancestor s tale is a weighty undertaking but with dawkins literate exposition reading it is not a ponderous task dawkins takes apart the creationist argument of irreducible complexity francis crick codiscoverer of dna himself whether with regret or relief itis hard to say finds little good evidence to support his own theory of directedpanspermia but the hinterland between science and science fiction constitutesa useful mental gymnasium in which to wrestle with a genuinely important question given that the illusion of designed conjured by darwinian natural selection is so breathtakingly powerful how do we in practice distinguishits products from deliberately designed artifacts could there be genuinelypersuasive examples of irreducible complexity in nature complex organizationmade of many parts the loss of any one of which would be fatal to the whole if so might this suggest genuine design by a superior intelligence say froman older and more civilized planet presoundingly no dawkins writes

wonderful book this was a very easy to read book that i found comforting during my month struggle of ttc i enjoyed her take on relaxing the body and mind and felt that i benefited from the book it was a fairly quick read for me i am only giving it stars because even though i had been ttc for almost years the last part of the book was a little scary to me discussing the failure rates of procedures like iui and ivf and talking about how the odds are stacked against you it also talked about making the decision to be childless which although realistic put me into a panic overall it is a wonderful book and after months of trying week after i finished the book i found out i was pregnant of course we are very excited and i appreciated the irony of reading such a book and feeling very worried and then finally being pregnant it did help me to relax and try to put things into perspective 
intense reading this collection of interviews with flanagan and his wife along with some of his creative work is a great tribute to a man who had so much to overcome and did it in a way that most of society could not understand it would have been easy for someone to give up or to become self focused but flanagan used his body and his mind to push himself push his illness and try to educate the rest of the world about his struggle and about kink a lot of what is written and shown will disturb you it should distrub you but you ll walk away thinking he was a very brave man

captivating story of trends in development thinking mallaby tells a fine story that achieves a balance between good storytelling and insightful analysis he discusses several questions what have been the major trends in thought regarding development strategies within the world bank over the last several decades specifically since wolfhensohn took over in why does the world bank move so slowly who are the competing stakeholders to whom the bank must listen what are their respective interests and how do these interests conflict who is jim wolfensohn what are his major strengths and faults did he do a good job running the bank the book is quite a bit more than a biography it provides a brief history of what s been occurring in developing nations throughout the last decade and why i enjoyed mallaby s writing style clever articulate and adept at using memorable images to discuss complex ideas i gave the book stars because i felt that mallaby succeeds at balancing analysis with narrative and doing so in sparkling prose this book is useful for anyone interested in learning a bit more about what the world bank does what are its challenges what are the big ideas being tossed around by development experts and of course who is jim wolfensohn

brilliant biography of a very difficult subject having been a rabid fan of o brians aubrey maturin novels and then joyfully discovering his two earlier sea novels i encouraged every friends and family member i thought would be interested to read those wonderful books though biographies are not a favorite genre of mine i was presented with this book as a gift because it was well known among my loved ones that o brians work had meant so much to me over the years i had no idea of o brians persona dean king is to be commended for putting together a very well constructed biography of an extremely difficult subject o brian deliberately obfuscated his past distorted facts and outright lied to even close friends throughout his entire life his attempt to hide his own past must have been a terrible obstacle to writing this biography but king did a wonderful job ultimately i realized that i would have keenly disliked o brian had i known him personally and i m glad that never happened instead i can simply enjoy the fruits of his marvelous creativity dean king is to be commended for his hard work and meticulous research he is honest at those points when he doesn t have all the facts so presents what he feels is the most likely scenario in summary being neither iconoclastic nor apologist king s unbiased and frank account of patrick o brians strange life and how it translated into the nuances of his novels is perceptive and engaging 
wing ding col carlson told his story without a lot of hype he makes one feel like they are there it is a pleasure that i had the chance to serve in the air force with such men who gave so much we of that war are leaving at a fast rate such great stories are all that will be left too soon 
red star rogue it is the most astounding book i have ever read it adds hundreds of details on of soviet russia s submarines known as k which sank in the pacific near hawaii in march after long searches by the soviet fleet and much us investigation the us sub uss halibut secretly found and photo d it about miles deep later in in the early s the glomar explorer secretly raised most of the seriously damaged soviet submarine the media mentioned a bit of the mysterious news in the post watergate era of mid s a few years ago the book blind man s bluff added many intriguing details to the mystery of the sinking of the russian sub red star rogue provides numerous details that point to the likelihood that the russian sub self destructed during an attempted launch of one of its nuclear missiles about miles northwest of honolulu this incredible if true event was apparently not sponsored by brezhnev the ussr cold war leader of the day did andropov or suslov order it one of the st folks to find evidence of the sinking were university of hawaii folks the book implies that a full accounting of what happened is long overdue to say the least photos of the wrecked soviet sub are apparently still held by the cia and the book implies that careful exam of the ultra top secret pictures will show that the sub was destroyed when its nuclear missile blew up in the sub s launch tube somebody the media the government or some of the people involved should come forward and tell the world what the hell happened in march in any case president johnson promptly ordered the development of an anti missile defense system and all presidents since have maintained the secrets about this possibly barelyavoided armageddon criticism of the book seems to be strictly uninformed criticism of the book s brief speculation about the evil doers never tobeknown motives but i ve seen no questioning of the facts there s a yahoo group on the subject 
definitive word on an american filmmaker some have criticized this book which welles felt was the definitive word on his films by stating that it never deals with orson s children or his failed marriages that has nothing to do with what this book is about if you are looking for a biography then look elsewhere this is orson welles talking about his films and his life in film and what he was trying to do and say when i finished reading i knew that for once welles was getting the final word on his films and that what he said was honest if you want to really know him as an artist i would strongly recommend reading this book it s a very fast read even though it s crammed full of insights as a bonus it also contains the shooting script for magnificent ambersons which would have exceeded citizen kane in its beauty if rko hadn t cut it to shreds i strongly recommend this book 
fantasy thriller white night jim butcher s ninth installment of the dresden files unfortunately was my introduction to this series with no prior background it was somewhat difficult to decipher the order of things and nuances of protagonist harry dresden s supernatural world dresden you see is a chicago based private investigator but also a wizard imbued with mystical powers and toting both a magnum handgun and staff capable of dispensing lethal hellfire dresden who holds the exalted status of warden in the white council of wizards often works with sgt murphy of chicago p d s special investigation unit on matters outside the realm of normalcy they presently were collaborating on a case involving the serial murders of a number of chicago women in possesion of magical powers the crime scenes contained clues that could only be discerned by someone with dresden s mystical ability evidence seems to point to dresden s brother thomas a vampire as the culprit in the killings as the plot thickens we learn that the white council is at odds with both the white and red courts of vampires the killings of the local women is following a similar pattern seen in other large cities and that some nefarious plot is being hatched dresden recruits his long ago first love the magically endowed elaine mallory with chicago s pre eminent crime lord john marcone and west coast based warden carlos ramirez and his apprentice the unrefined but powerful molly to fight against the forces of darkness in a final battle which will decide the fate of the supernatural order of things butchers imaginative fable was quite well conceived but made me realize that i needed background information to appreciate it more fully

a god who learns to forgive this review is dedicated to my father along with midsummer night s dream and macbeth the tempest was one of my father s favorite plays this play begins with an unfortunate ship caught in a storm in the next scene we move from the ocean to a nearby island there we learn that the tempest was not from natuaral causes but from the magic of our hero prospero prospero has a grudge against certain members of the ship prospero tells his daughter miranda the story of his past miranda must be in her late teens at least but she often sounds a lot younger quite possibly due to the fact that she has lead such a sheltered life his brother antonio usurped his dukedom and handed control over to king alonso prospero and his daughter were banished and the benevolent gonzalo furnished prospero with books he loved prospero has been called the greatest representation of shakespeare himself we may also note that while prospero is the hero of this play he does have one notable fault he does enjoy playing god one example is when his fairy servant ariel begs the promised freedom of air rather than asking politely for just a little extra time which is certainly not unheard of between friends prospero reminds ariel that he rescued ariel from imprisonment by sycorax and he threatens ariel with consequences if ariel brings up the matter again before it is time moving on we meet the deceased sycorax s remaining son caliban prospero tried to be nice to caliban but caliban crossed the line by trying to rape his daughter miranda again prospero plays god rather than using his magic to destroy caliban he keeps him alive and makes caliban perform services that he finds disagreeable disgrace is more painful than death we later meet ferdinand the son of the king on the ship he sees miranda and loves her prospero feels he can not let his daughter be won too easily and like caliban ferdinand is subjected to manual labor onto act the crew of the boat from has survived and made it to the island shakespeare uses an interesting technique here through prospero s passages we see the king as his enemy but we are allowed generous sympathy for him when he is struck with sorrow over his missing son and even ariel prosperos loyal servant thwarts an attempt by anotnio and sebastian to kill the king caliban then meets stephano and trinculo the three become friends through the comical use of some wine and join together to defeat prospero and take over the island onto act ferdinand and miranda express their love for each other and prospero watching from an unseen location is pleased anotnio and sebastian make another plan to kill alonso at this point we can infer that ariel has warned prospero of the caliban stephanotriculo conspiracy but prospero sees yet another chance to play god antonio sebastian alonso and gonzalo are starving so prospero and ariel create an image of banquet long enough to tantalize them before they make it vanish some people may find this funny but it is somewhat below the belt and it does prove my point that prospero likes playing god onto act prospero shows his gentler side when he tells ferdinand that he consents to the marriage of miranda to him like a reasonable father he asks that ferdinand wait until the marriage is performed in a beautiful midsummer night s dream nostalgia moment there is a dance of fairies one interesting thing we notice here is yet another reason why miranda sounds a lot younger than she is she must be in her late teens but as i said before she sounds much younger a little too sweet and innocent well prospero does not confide in her prospero did not tell her of the conspiracy against him one reason may be that prospero who likes playing god thought the attempt on his life was laughable it may also be that prospero realizes that the concept of a conspiracy against his life would be beyond the scope of this gentle and kind but too sheltered miranda recall miranda was still an infant in exile moving on prospero gives the famous and beautiful passage our revels now have ended it is tempting to believe that shakespeare is getting ready to say farewell to his art seeing that the tempest was his nd last play well the joy of the moment is broken as prospero realizes his enemies are still out there in prospero gives yet another beautiful passage on his accomplishments and with the help of ariel prospero realizes that revenge is not a virtue rather forgiveness is interesting that someone who enjoyed playing god finally realizes that forgiveness is the true merit of a god well prospero reconciles with the king antonio and sebastian and forgives them soon afterwards prospero informs the king that his son ferdinand is safe and happily getting ready to marry miranda even caliban stephano and trinculo are forgiven the play ends in utter happiness some people like to think that prospero breaking his staff is an indication that shakespeare will write no more but as isaac asimov said this is too sentimental a compulsive writer like shakespeare could not deliberately plan to give up writing while he was still capable of holding a pen and in support of isaac asimov shakespeare did afterwards write henry viii as well as parts of the two noble kinsmen 
nice primer i wish i had bought this book initially i was pretty new to digital video i had lots of questions about transferring capturing analog audio and so far this book has answered them it would have saved time to buy it first im using the digital video for a vidcast

a fellow comedian and writer s review okay the title s really long in fact that s all i read in my first sitting then i took a much needed break im a standup comedian i ve worked with or met many of the comedians in this book and i briefly met one of the authors mark schiff at the funny firm in chicago back when i was just starting out in comedy back in whew i m getting old i was eighteen then i wanted to get that all out in the open all that being said this is an unbiased review which with my background is able to shed a little more light on the subject when touring as a comedian many of us stay in comedy condos basically apartments where the clubs put up the acts for the week there s not a lot to do during the day so we often end up sharing stories from the road and they tend to be very very funny even outrageous there s strange things out there stalker fans rutheless club owners serendipitous events well you get the idea long time veteran comedians mark schiff and ritch shydner astutely decided to gather some of these stories and share them with the world in a book i actually had a similar idea only to share stories of comedians and bands worst gigs entitled ghastly gigs a much shorter title you ll notice perhaps i still will in fact i definitely will i will start gathering the stories today the stories in i killed true stories are wide and varied some are about sex some about bad gigs some about bad weather and at least one is even heartfelt they are all funny and at times laugh out loud hilarious no doubt some people will squirm at some of the more graphic stories but they re really not that graphic ritch and mark interject terms like privates instead of using the proper physiological terminology when called for in a story given that some of the stories are about rodney dangerfield or come from chris rock the graphicness is hardly surprising in the business we call these stories blue they hardly compare to the graphic nature or conversation of r rated films such as american pie still some readers will find it to be raunchy graphic yes raunchy no i am always intrigued by such a position raunchy is reserved for unnecessary graphicness where the description is unneeded for i killed to be honest and accurate it most contain some graphic depiction otherwise the stories would be somewhat lacking and leave the reader questioning what the story was actually about none of the stories involve graphic violence i always find it amusing that people will label a non violent story about sex raunchy yet not label an episode of law order svu raunchy most of the crime shows on tv are far more graphic and descriptive than mark and ritch s book yet because they are violent they are not raunchy chew on that the layout of the book is quite simple the name of the comedian telling the story is in bold the story itself follows the name then it s on to the next story in short the book is a collage of funny stories of many of the industries most popular acts there is one flaw with the book the first rule of comedy or any form of entertainment for that matter is know your audience some of the lingo used in the book would not be familiar to people outside the comedy industry the terms aren t too hard to figure out but they can be confusing for example what s a feature act a hack if i were a savvy salesman i would tell you to read my book god is a woman dating disasters first it s about funny dating disasters only but i make an excellent point of defining all the comedy lingo as i introduce it but i m a sucky salesman so i ll simply provide a key here gig a show for which a comedian has been hired to performopener opens the show and typically emcees itfeature the middle act in the show going on between the opener and the headliner aka closer hack a comedian who does other acts material or does old bits that have been done to deathone nighter a one night gig usually in a smaller venue like a small townhell gig a gig that sucks usually a bad one nightercomedy condo an apartment where the acts are put up by the clubbit a joke or concept in a comedian s acttag to recall a bit again later in the show sometimes more than oncemost of the terms are eventually explained by some of the comedians in their stories but not until long after they have been introduced this could be an editing flaw with the book and have nothing to do with the authors it is an oversight that occurred somewhere and gives the book its only real flaw in summary i killed is a simple book that is quite funny it s an easy flowing read that achieves its goal of conveying life on the road and making us laugh i recommend it and give it out stars citing its only flaw as failing to explain some of the comedy lingo when it is first introduced fun read ! i am looking forward to the sequel i killed two which is already in the works i can t wait to read it !

zany illustrations accompanying whimsical poems siebold s zany illustrations accompany whimsical poems by wilbur which combine plays on words with instructions about language kids receive some fun lessons on word usage along with some fun images representing the best of fantasy 
organization could be tweaked don t get me wrong i still think the book deserves stars for doing a grade a presentation of material topics are presented clearly and without fuss and even examples are logically but thoroughly discussed without the bludgeoning that typically accompanies code examples in introductory language texts one minor failing is that occasionally i came across instances the author makes use of constructs in examples where they have not yet been presented it might have been intentional as it forces the reader to get acquainted with the reference section but it s a little disconcerting the macro section left me hungry for more but that s what on lisp available online for free from paul graham s website is for and the package discussion was a little sparse keywords were sort of confusing practical common lisp at http wwwgigamonkeyscombook does a better job but overall a great read i have to agree with the other reviewer that i wish more substantial programming exercises were given this won t be a problem for students who are using the book as a text in a lisp based course obviously but for self study practitioners it would be icing on the cake 
challenging you to step up to the plate this story gives me hope in mankind again despite the horrendous abuse this woman gave herself all of herself to save a child from the torment she experienced i wish there were more people like torey hayden in this world i can only hope that i can touch lives in the way ms hayden has this book will open eyes to the terrors of abuse that does indeed occur in this world despite the fact that we would like to close our eyes to it it also demonstrates the hope that victims can overcome and the need for us to step up to the plate to end this war of terror

these are vignettes designed to inspire further exploration the widely divergent reviews reflect a lack of understanding of the purpose of this book it is meant to touch on many mathematical ideas not to go into depth on any one idea my son read this at age then at and again at getting something more out of it every time many of the ideas intrigued and inspired him to seek out more information on his own to research and understand more deeply for that purpose it deserves the highest rating i did not give stars because there are some instances where i did find errors these do not detract from the purpose of the book but they are annoying to those of us who try to delve deeper what i consistently found myself doing is researching from the internet and other print resources but the idea originated from the overview in the book many recreational mathematics books are inaccessible to beginners or math phobes this book allows you to sample many many ideas without feeling overwhelmed by details you may not understand if you want details you go explore the world opened up by the book 
enlightening i never realized just how bad things were in the muslim world until i read this book this book gives a very detailed and personal account of the problems muslims are facing because of their belief system including endless poverty broken homes and abused women she is one of the few muslim women to criticize the practices and beliefs of islam and as a result her life is in danger and she needs around the clock protection she also exposes many of the problems european countries are facing because their multiculturalist leaders and intellectuals refuse to defend freedom and secularism 
breakthrough book dianne lancaster s wonderful book offers valuable insight and practical stepbystep information about how to support the development and emotional well being of a new generation of kids these children are pushing us forward on a cultural learning curve we are raising a generation of more finely attuned beings who feel more want more and who have more to contribute ms lancaster elucidates this phenomenon and explains why these children are unwilling and constitutionally unable to tolerate outworn models of communication and power that hurt she shows how we can relate to them in ways that work for them transforming anger and frustration to love and understanding she also explains how we can learn to do this for ourselves learning to recognize and address our own needs and anger so that we don t respond to them automatically in a triggered state this book brings so much information clarity and just plain truth to the subject that readers will want to savor it slowly allowing the material to resonate and integrate my experience in reading it was similar to first time reading works of harville hendrix catherine ponder and louise hay a sense of enlivenment joyful recognition that i as a reader had been given a marvelous gift this author s contributions are of the same caliber and teach us what we need to know right now for our kids and ourselves i recommend it most highly kanta bosniak director the alpha learning institut 
good diet for life while i must unfortunately agree with the person who wrote in another review that this diet could have been put out in a page pamphlet most diet books consist of pep talk and real diet information anyway i won t let that stop me from praising this book initially a friend of mine recommended it as a possible way to lower my cholesterol something which is obliquely suggested in the book but which is not a major point of the diet at the time my physician had recommended that i go on medication for my cholesterol which i desperately wanted to avoid after three months on this diet my cholesterol dropped from to without medication admittedly i did some things simultaneously that went beyond the diet such as drastically dropping my caffeine intake and eating whole grains instead of refined starches but i do believe that the major benefit came from burning up all the excess fat that came from carbohydrates the best part about this diet though is that after a day or two you don t feel hungry any more after being on this diet for six months i sincerely believe that there is such a thing as carbohydrate addiction i also believe that this addiction has a bewildering array of side effects that we are not likely to recognize as being caused by excess carbohydrates in the system things like hyperactiveness lack of sleep being hungry all the time and depression needless to say i lost weight forty pounds the best part of that is that i wasn t really obese just overweight and now my weight is perfect for my height lb that s good news for those people who are trying to get those last five or ten pounds off and can t quite manage it i intend to keep with the diet maybe for the rest of my life i m used to it now and i hardly notice it which is another great feature of this diet i don t know if it will provide the same benefits for other people but it was certainly what i needed 
wow i loved the first two books but this one is the best yet ! virgina has now grown up at first i was sad that her teen years adventures were over but reading about her as an adult has been thrilling so many things including an abused child her own children a husband struggles and her grandmother happen to her through the whole thing she realizes that her relationship with christ is not what it should be i think that this book has a great value to it 
great research describes the state of the art there are a lot of books on digital cameras and how to take digital pictures there are also a lot on processing these images to create the special effects that you might want but up until now i have not seen any that talk about converting these beautiful images into something so mundane as a picture you can put into an envelope and send home or hang on the wall of course everyone starts out with an inexpensive ink jet printer the kind you get at walmart or where ever for only a few tens of dollars the next step is to realize that the ordinary typing paper you ve been using is not the best so you go get some that promises photo quality if the result you re getting with this approach is satisfactory for your needs you need go no further and this book probably isn t for you i say probably because there are hints here on paper ink and techniques that will help you get the most out of any printer but if you want to go further up to advanced amateur standing or beyond then i d consider this book a necessity it covers everything from printer technologies to specific brands to inks to papers at this level you re not talking about printers and just getting the right printer is worth far more than the cost of this book it clearly represents the state of the art in photo printing today

popspick plus don t miss this book for teachers the last two chapters of this book are worth the price of the book it leaves a lasting impression 
good crichton not his best intriguing as always exciting from the first page strong for the first rds and less editorializing than usual but it s just not as good as his higher concept novels but it s still very enjoyable all the way through and as always makes you think it feels a little dated now but i re read it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time sphere should definitely be a part of any crichton fan s library skip the movie though here the science is less convincing than in jurrassic park which is mostly convincing but stretched and prey which is better writing and fun but not convincing but that doesn t matter because crichton can write an adventure like few others as long as character isn t important characters here take backseat to concept and science pace as always is good more a rollicking adventure than something to think about typical of later novels and quite enjoyable on that level it s the kind of novel you ll tear through in a weekend at most and that s a good thing 
a must read for all who plan to self publish written in his engaging yet informative style peter bowerman s well fed self publisher wfsp represents yet another generous gift to the writing community the wfsp is not only a pleasure to read but sets forth in clear step bystep directions the many small but important tasks that one must do not just to self publish a book plenty of books on the how to logistics of that but to do it profitably there s even a section at the end that has a time line to make sure you are on track with everything it s a rare blend of compelling read and reference book you won t have to waste your time or money on any other self publishing book really i also highly recommend the biz inabox materials that accompany the book available through his wellfedsp site the price is about depending on how you buy them but frankly he s way undercharging for them you d have to pay a marketing person thousands to create the same and if you write for a living and worry about making your mortgage payment do yourself a favor and get his two other well fed writer books today if possible 
good reading skeleton man is another masterpiece for tony hellerman only problem is he doesn t write them fast enough 
great book that shows what hypothyroidism can mimic i have the older version of this book and it is so good i m sure this one is even better i was amazed to see how many other diseases hypothyroidsim can mimic 
journal of a christian i bought the book looking to know more about bonhoeffer s theology and ended up learning more about my own though at times i didn t agree with his thoughts i found myself agreeing with the man these letters mix profound questions with small daily details of life it is authentic and transparent in a way that typical straightforward theology books can t be there is honest articulate and earnest faith in these unselfconscious and private thoughts 
loved it very enjoyable it was nice taking a travel through history in a period of time not so frequently written about the up and down see saw of merewyn s and ruman s star crossed love was heartbreaking at times i don t want to say more to give out the end it isn t katherine by a long shot but still a good read and i would recommend to any lover of historical fiction 
hallelujah maya angelou can write orate and narrate but here she is wearing a different hat as chef these recipes chronicle some important memories including fried chicken for when the pastor came to visit lemon meringue cake which her brother savored for and couselet which she served to none other then m k fisher there are few people who have lived such an extraordinary life then ms angelou but her recipes reflect simple good cooking that her grandmother used to make where she wasted nothing check out the recipe for crackling crackling and passed to her i love southern food and a lot of these recipes blow away the homestyle food served here i love her potato salad with all the eggs and pickles her collards lettuce and peas and of course the banana pudding yum there is something so fufilling to read her memoirs and savor some of these comfort foods then prepare and relive the stories she s telling only maya angelou can have that effect on people 
strange flowers in spanish la experiencia surrealista toma lugar en la ciudad que aragon la reconstruye estticamente en una potica de la fragmentacin la imaginacin de la ciudad no es de ninguna manera simblica sino que responde al sustrato material de la experiencia fragmentada en el centro de este mundo de cosas est el ms soado de sus objetos la misma ciudad de pars  las imgenes en el surrealismo adquieren un sentido profundamente histrico aun cuando su contexto sea ensoado como naturaleza simblica como bosque de smbolos baudelaire o mitologa moderna por cuanto la historicidad de las imgenes surrealistas son el contenido latente de una realidad transformada en realidad onrica ningn rostro es surrealista en el grado en que lo es el verdadero rostro de la ciudad las imgenes son las alegoras ensoadas de la ciudad en el cual se proyecta la melancola y el mundo fragmentado de la calle el paysan de paris proveniente del campo a la ciudad no es un simple recurso narrativo pone en evidencia la diferencia entre ambos contextos de experiencia que servir de fuerte contraste y excelente ejemplo del cambio que sufri la consciencia esttica en el siglo xix el tiempo de los passages esto es la transicin de una esttica basada en la naturaleza con kant y el romanticismo hacia una esttica del artificio que parte con baudelaire hacia los surrealistas pasando por mallarm rimbaud valry y los simbolistas aragon comienza su libro con un prefacio a una nueva mitologa una mitologa moderna que desprecia toda certeza cartesiana del conocimiento y aboga por una primaca de la imaginacin puesto que la razn descansa para aragn en el error fundamental de que la realidad es la certeza la evidencia a partir de aqu el error se define con relacin a esta pretensin de evidencia que es al mismo tiempo pretensin de autonoma subjetiva cette ombre de laquelle il prtend se passer pour dcrire la lumiere c est l erreur avec ses caracteres inconnus l erreur qui seule pourrait tmoigner a celui qui l aurait envisage de la fugitive realit lerreur s accompagne de certitude l erreur s impose par l evidence et tout ce qui se dit de la verit qu on le dise de l erreur on ne se trompera pas davantage il n y aurait pas d erreur sans le sentiment meme de l evidence sans lui on ne s arreterait jamais a l erreursin embargo la razn est habitada por flores extraas que corresponden con los errores de los sentidos admirables jardins des croyances absurdes des pressentiments des obsessions et des dlires donde nacen para aragon dioses desconocidos que a excepcin de los antiguos son susceptibles al tiempo pertenecen al mundo profano de la historia humana donde des mythes nouveaux naissent sous chacun de nos pas este es el reino de la imaginacin donde ella no se ocupa no ms del pensamiento y de la afirmacin de la subjetividad sino de estas transformaciones despreciadas la imaginacin surrealista es el origen de la mitologa moderna pero es una mitologa que es autoconsciente y que va en contra del pretendido desencantamiento de la cultura moderna ah est su actualidad histrica la surrealidad consciente es simplemente una respuesta objetiva al reencantamiento del mundo social de la industria que no se piensa como tal sino que de acuerdo con max weber es pura racionalizacin entzauberung an ms precisamente la visin surrealista pone en evidencia el carcter encantado del mundo capitalista su reactivacin de los poderes mticos la mitologa moderna de aragon es precisamente transformar mediante su potica de la ensoacin y su concepcin del azar objetivo l hasard objectif el mundo racionalizado en un mundo mtico de la misma manera que adorno y horkheimer hicieron filosficamente en la dialektik der aufklrung la imaginacin de esta manera trasciende la subjetividad racionalizadora y revela mediante sus correspondencias con los objetos realidades y puntos de vista susceptibles de ser utilizados como elementos crticos el contexto urbano de la obra surrealista revela primero una perspectiva diferente de la imaginacin que no puede ser explicada a partir de trminos simblicoso metafricos segundo un contexto de experiencia diferente el urbano que no instituye una esttica de la serenidad y del desinters esto es una esttica moral kant sino una esttica del shock poltica vanguardista y tercero una depotenciacin del sujeto potico autnomo de s mismo que incluye una depotenciacin de la bondad de la naturaleza que ya no dicta de ninguna manera las reglas al genio este contexto urbano afecta la perspectiva de la imaginacin de dos maneras primero que la imaginacin al ensoar la ciudad como mitologa precisamente revela lo ms objetivo de la realidad la fantasmagora de la mercanca que se abstrae de toda relacin social de trabajo y que precisamente la racionalidad objetivante de las estructuras sociales modernas se transforman en lo ms subjetivo y arbitrario el encantamiento que trae consigo el progreso y el consumo basado en los escritos de max weber ha sido lugar comn en teora social decir que la esencia de la modernidad es la desmitificacin y el desencantamiento del mundo social sin embargo basado tambin en la visin surrealista podemos decir que la industrializacin ha trado un reencantamiento del mundo social la surrealidad como veremos es implcitamente objetiva y crtica porque implica un reencantamiento de esta clase de mundo es paradjica porque mediante la ensoacin y el mito propio de la experiencia surrealista se pone en evidencia precisamente el carcter encantado y mtico del mundo capitalista y esta ambigedad la puede llevar con todo us rigor la imaginacin lo ms subjetivo la imaginacin surrealista revela lo ms objetivo la naturaleza mitolgica de la industria y lo ms objetivo la estructura racionalizada de la sociedad de mercado revela lo ms subjetivo y fantasmagrico la naturaleza encantada de la mercanca donde se abstrae toda relacin social de mercado us objetividad fantasmtica marx as mediante el mismo ensueo ocurre una depotenciacin del sujeto del entendimiento autnomo mediante el privilegio de la imaginacin que revela paradjicamente mejor la objetividad las tres variaciones anteriores una perspectiva nueva de la imaginacin procedente del contexto especfico de experiencia de la ciudad que implica una esttica del shock que desvaloriza la unidad racional desinteresada y contemplativa del sujeto podemos unirlas en la tesis que es a la vez de este ensayo de que la constitucin de las imgenes en el surrealismo por ms digmoslo as subjetiva y mtica que sea es paradjicamente muy objetiva e histrica esto de dos maneras una en cuanto que la imaginacin es la base para instaurar la fragmentacin del sujeto mediante la ensoacin potica y segundo que la imaginacin en correspondencia con el objeto revela dimensiones desconocidas de ste y que es por tanto ms objetiva en cuanto no existe una primaca del sujeto sobre el objeto mediante el concepto ms objetiva la imaginacin que la razn porque sta ltima usa el objeto para tener certeza de s misma el objeto es el medio de la autoconocimiento de la razn que al final se desecha por irrelevante de esta manera la imaginacin llevada a cabo en el contexto ciudadano revela dimensiones fantsticas debido a la esencial extraeza en que el sujeto se pone frente a lo urbano estas dimensiones fantasmagricas onricas sirven al mismo tiempo para establecer una visin mtica de la ciudad y la modernidad misma que as destruyen la visin comn de la modernidad como tiempo de la razn la treta de este mundo de cosas consiste de permutar la mirada histrica sobre lo que ya ha sido por la poltica  la imaginacin tiene en este sentido un potencial crtico mayor que la racionalidad este pasaje de los reflejos y representaciones a analogas y correspondencias recuerdan extraamente en los surrealistas una actitud medieval en la introduction au discours sur le peu de realit sugiere breton que el realismo filosfico de la edad media est a la base de la experiencia potica pero ese realismo su fe por tanto en una existencia aparte de los conceptos ya fuera ya dentro de las cosas ha encontrado siempre muy rpidamente el trnsito del reino conceptual lgico al reino mgico de las palabras la progresiva depotenciacin de la naturaleza en la esttica postromntica del siglo xix coincide con un progresivo desmontaje del sujeto potico en la concepcin artstica ya hegel haba abandonado el canon de la belleza de la naturaleza propio de la esttica kantiana para afirmar que la belleza artstica artificial es una encarnacin superior de la idea que la belleza natural la ltima etapa de la belleza natural en la esttica de lo sublime desemboca en una esttica de lo maravilloso con baudelaire baudelaire posteriormente transforma la enemistad de la naturaleza en una esttica del culto a lo artificial y da con esto en el comienzo de una poesa de la industria el concepto negativo de naturaleza en esta poca est ya presupuesto en la determinacin moderna del arte como anti physis tanto en baudelaire como en marx y valry lo que implica una prdida de la obligatoriedad ejemplar de ella que ya solo sirve para la imaginacin de nuevos mundos este giro en la valoracin de la naturaleza lo marca paradigmticamente el giro del campo a la ciudad a travs de la industrializacin y por tanto el contexto de experiencia humana cambia cualitativamente por el lado del sujeto potico ste ya no encuentra su propia autoafirmacin en correspondencia con la natura naturans en la unidad romntica del yo y la naturaleza sino que la nueva esttica est acompaada de nuevos miedos y experiencias de alienacin en el anonimato del mundo industrial por lo cual el poeta tiene que recurrir a su interioridad imaginativa que implica un escape de la objetividad mediante la ensoacin y la ebriedad el recuerdo se actualiza involuntariamente mediante asociaciones espontneas fortuitas como postul por otro lado proust as el sueo y el recuerdo son las memorias involuntarias de esta manera la experiencia surrealista del entorno est ubicada afuera de la voluntad o del entendimiento no es una decisin propia de un sujeto autnomo sino de la pura imaginacin tout relve de l imagination et de l imagination tout rvle la imaginacin subordinada al entendimiento o a la voluntad no existe en el surrealismo y de esta manera se vuelve absolutamente autnomo del sujeto pero no del entorno es la ensoacin del entorno porque no hay imaginacin sin percepcin de esta manera podemos llegar a la afirmacin de que la imaginacin mejor que las imgenes son absolutamente objetivas no dependen de nuestra inteligencia discours de l imaginationaujourdhui je vous apporte un stupfiant venu des limites de la conscience des frontires de l bime qu avezvous cherch jusqu ici dans les drogues sinon un sentiment de puissance une mgalomanie menteuse et les libres exercice de vos facults dans le vide le produit que j ai l honneur de vous prsenter procure tout cela procure aussi d inmenses avantages inespers dpasse vos dsirs les suscite vous fait accder a des dsirs nouveaux inmenss le vice appel surrealisme est l emploi drgl et passionel du stupfiant image ou plutot de la provocation sans controle de l image pour elle meme et pour ce qu elle entraine dans le domaine de la reprsentation de perturbations imprvisibles et de mtamorphoses car chaque image a chaque coup vous force a rviser tout l universla imagen constituye un golpe como de golpes es de dnde ella precede en el contexto de lo urbano y en este sentido se diferencia de la serenidad desinteresada propio de lo simblico justamente proveniendo de la velocidad urbana la imagen que se manifiesta involuntariamente es el modo de asociacin con el entorno donde un sujeto autoconsciente no est ms a la base de la percepcin asimismo la imagen surrealista reclama una transformacin de la praxis vital de los receptores y niega toda actitud desinteresada ante el arte la analoga en el plano de la produccin y recepcin artsticas es evidente mientras que la ciudad o en el plano esttico la obra de arte se constituye tambin como shock estmulo velocidad en la recepcin la imagen tambin es shock cuestiona toda esfera vital y obliga fuerza a revisar todo el universo la imagen surrealista es entonces negacin de lo real para constituirse en lo posible fantstico mediante la fantasmagora y la provocacin y que es coherente con el contexto ciudadano moderno de donde surge y al mismo tiempo obliga a revisar nuestras concepciones fundamentales de la imaginacin y contemplacin estticas la primera como principio de produccin la segunda de recepcin a partir de esta categora central de la imagen presente en el paysan de paris es la base para toda una revisin de la imaginacin y la intuicin fundamental de toda obra vanguardista o de otra manera el concepto de imagen e imaginacin en el surrealismo es la categora central para explicar su carcter de obra vanguardista puesto que la obra vanguardista pertenece al concepto especfico de lo urbano el contexto de experiencia de la modernidad de dnde surge el arte moderno y en especial aqu el surrealismo revela tres caractersticas especficas la novedad el azar el montaje estas tres caractersticas son funden en una cuarta que las engloba en el caso del surrealismo la imagen siendo la imaginacin una cuestin espontnea como el recuerdo involuntario en proust la imagen se revela absolutamente objetiva como objetivos pretendidamente son la novedad el azar y el montaje en las sociedades modernas la imagen es la expresin objetiva de las sociedades modernas as como ella pretende ser siempre nueva novedad que se actualiza siempre en el golpe coup las sociedades modernas siempre quieren ser nuevas en la moda as como la imagen pretende ser azarosa en las mltiples coincidencias que los surrealistas quieren encontrar en la realidad as el correlato estructural es el funcionamiento de las sociedades modernas se basan en una serie de decisiones individuales atomizadas que componen una especie de autoorganizacin disipativa donde no se puede encontrar un estado inicial de cosas al que se pueda referir como causa sino un desorden inicial je vivais au hasard a la poursuite du hasard je m abandonnais donc les jours coulaient a cette sorte de baccara tournant y finalmente as como la imagen funciona mediante montaje es decir mediante la acumulacin inorgnica de emblema por la falta de un sentido objetivo as las sociedades funcionan mediante un montaje de instituciones estructuras y mercancas que como el montaje funcionan por el sentido arbitrario que la sociedad les confiere as el sueo del paysan es esta arbitrariedad que reviste caracteres mticos por la expresin de la imaginacin pero que sin embargo en ella se anuncia una objetividad sorpresiva il y a dans le monde un dsordre impensable et l extraordinaire est qu a leur ordinaire aient recherch sous l apparence du dsordre un ordre mystrieux l esprit de l homme en supporte pas le dsordre parce qu il en peut le penser je veux dire qu il en peut le penser premierement la notion de l ordre n est point compense par la notion inexpugnable du dsordre de esta manera el desorden es objetivo l hasard objectif y a la progresiva depotenciacin de la causalidad y racionalidad natural corresponde una actitud subjetiva igualmente azarosa y mltiple es decir desubjetivizada que solo la imaginacin puede cumplir mediante la ensoacin con el fin de dominar los accidentes organizar el pesimismo no es otra cosa que transportar fuera de la poltica a la metfora smbolo moral y descubrir en el campo de la accin poltica el mbito de las imgenes de pura cepa  ya valry deca que los accidentes pueden ser causados y el azar se erige como una categora central objetiva para corresponder a la imaginacin autnoma del sujeto el descubrimiento de las maravillas de lo cotidiano escribe burger representa evidentemente un enriquecimiento de las posibilidades de experiencia del hombre urbano sin embargo est ligada a un tipo de conducta que renuncia a las iniciativas en favor de una disposicin universal a la impresin los surrealistas no se dan por satisfechos con ella y buscan la provocacin de lo excepcional cmo se constituye este giro tan radical en la concepcin esttica a principios del siglo xix los romnticos alemanes protestando contra el racionalismo ilustrado haban abogado por un renacimiento de la mitologa en lo que schelling haba llamado un nuevo simbolismo universal basado en las cosas de la naturaleza las cuales significan y son al mismo tiempo todo simbolismo debe surgir de la naturaleza y volver a ella las cosas de la naturaleza son y significan al mismo tiempo solo en la mitologa hay un verdadero material simblico pero la mitologa misma solo es posible mediante la relacin de sus formas con la naturaleza el renacimiento de la visin simblica de la naturaleza debera ser el primer paso hacia una restitucin de una nueva mitologa en lo simblico de la naturaleza se manifiesta para los romnticos la esencia del fenmeno la totalidad de lo viviente en el siglo xx viendo la propuesta de la mitologa moderna aragoniana la nueva naturaleza de la industria y lo urbano han generado todo el poder mtico que estos romnticos hubieran deseado ahora est la imaginacin potica igual de serena y simblica en el contexto de lo moderno el romanticismo haba asumido que el arte podra ser la fuente de toda regeneracin de lo mitolgico los arquetipos goetheanos la mstica de schlegel el simbolismo de schelling todos estos anclados en el ideal del arte sin embargo la creatividad de la industria que en ese tiempo era considerada como tcnica y no arte es la que en realidad construye en lo moderno todo un mundo mtico de fotografas mercancas diseos industriales etc que reemplazan ese ideal humanista de un genio individual que produce todo un mundo mtico a travs del arte kant wagner etc las fuerzas mticas estn presentes en el nuevo mundo de la industria los romnticos queran fundar una nueva mitologa a travs de un contramundo campesino preindustrial y tradicional los surrealistas tambin hablan de una nueva mitologa y dieron en el punto porque sera nueva en todo sentido es decir anclada en el nuevo mundo de la industria en vez de ver a la cultura tradicional como fuente de inspiracin o como en el neoclasicismo adquiriendo smbolos de mitos antiguos los surrealistas vieron la naturaleza cambiante del paisaje industrial en s misma maravillosa y mtica el paysan de paris vaga intoxicado a travs del nuevo paisaje de mercancas as como su contraparte campesina vagara por un bosque encantado la torre eiffel le parece al paysan una jirafa el sacre coeur es un ictiosauro los tanques de gasolina en las bombas brillan con el aura de las divinidades ce sont de grands dieux rouges de grands dieux jaunes de grands dieux vertes fichs sur le bord des pistes spculatives que l esprit emprunte d un sentiment a l autre les scuplteurs sans nom quui ont elev ces fantomes metalliques se plier a une tradition aussi vive que celle qui traait les glises en croix ces idoles ont entre elles une parent qui les rend redoutables bariols de mots anglaises et des mots de cration nouvelle avec un seul bras long et souple une tete lumineuse sans visage le pied unique et le ventre a la roue chiffr les distributeurs d essence ont parfois l allure des divinits de l egypte ou de celles des peuplades anthropophages qui n adorent que la guerre o texaco motor oil eco shell grandes inscriptions du potentiel humaine ! bientot nous nous signerons devant vos fontaines et les plus jeunes d entre nous priront d avoir considr leur nymphes dans le naphte ms que el humor y la irona surrealistas el sentimiento de lo moderno en aragon trivializa y vulgariza aquello que es respetable en la cultura y de esta manera lo trivial se vuelve en objeto de respeto para el paysan de aragon lo milagroso emana de los fenmenos ms mundanos como de las peluqueras del passage de l opera le theatre moderne la galerie du barometre los cafs etc lejos de escapar como los romnticos a las formas viejas de la cultura la vuelta a los griegos de goethe la mitologa germana en wagner la imaginacin surrealista aprehende directamente la esencia metafsica as la llama aragon de las formas modernas il y avait des objets usuels qui a n en pas douter participaient pour moi du mystre me plongaient dans le mystre il me semblait bien que l essence de ces plaisirs fut toute metaphysique il me semblait bien qu elle impliqut leur ocassion une sorte de got passion de la rvlation un objet se transfigurait mes yeux il en prenait point l allure allgorique ni le caractre du symbole lo que distingue a estos nuevos dioses de los anteriores como dijimos es que estos son transitorios pertenecen a un mundo absolutamente profano donde sus poderes tambin son transitorios la transitoriedad de este nuevo mundo mtico funda un poder y una relacin imaginativa absolutamente nueva ya la imaginacin simblica es incapaz de asociarse con este nuevo mundo donde el devenir es us principio de poder puesto que el smbolo est ms ocupado con captar la eternidad de la idea esttica la imagen surrealista es un flash que puede cambiar tan rpido como el mundo de ah que el conocimiento y la poesa para aragon sea algo absolutamente concreto descends dans ton ide habite ton ide puisatier pendu ta corde la transitoriedad de estos dioses no son simblicas son terrenas il m apparut que l homme est plein de dieux comme une ponge inmerge en plein ciel ces dieux vivent l apoge de leur force puis meurent laissant d autres dieuxleurs autels parfums ils sont les principes mmes de toute transformation de toute ils sont la necessit du mouvement je me promenai donc avec ivresse au milieu de mille concrtions divines je me mis concevoir une mythologie en marche elle mritait proprement le nom de mythologie moderne je l imaginais sous ce nom la racionalidad instrumetal propia del conocimiento y la tcnica reprime algo que la imaginacin expresa que el nuevo mundo de la tcnica tambin es mtico lo que cambia por completo la consideracin tradicional de que la imaginacin es la subjetividad y la interioridad propi

very good i found this book very interesting and well written but not for all readers it covers all quantitative risk management topics with a good mathematical approach this could be a great textbook for general risk management courses and it give importance to evt technics mulivariate models and copula modelling the treatment of market risk is complete and exhaustive and a good actuarial approach for credit risk can be found too the operational risk chapter is poor it gives only an introductive section for it and for actuarial models it requires a good mathematical background to be well understand but it is a great book to introduce the whole quantitative risk management theory

rachel ray one must make allowences for the occasional sloppiness of trollope s writing given the serialized format and the incredible number of novels he wrote while working full time for the post office he always has something important to say and usually says it well this novel is one of his shortest and one of his best like george elliot and charles dickens trollope was dragged kicking and screaming into industrialized england in the th century and like them he saw beneath the glitz and glamor of new found wealth and the breakdown in social classes that followed the reform movement in england he seems at times to be overly preoccupied with the demise of the lady and the gentleman but this concern reveals a well founded alarm over the vanishing of such victorian values as nobility and duty to others in this novel he expresses many of those concerns while targetting the evangelicals an attack that is right on and timely indeed he reveals the hypocrisy of so many of those who are filled with resentment and hatred of their fellow humans while professing to bask in the love of christ i would rate this novel alongside the warden as first rate and excellent ways to come to anthony trollope who is in my view a vastly under rated writer despite his flaws 
good overview on southeast asia clark neher professor of political science and director of the center for southeast asian studies at northern illinois university presents a comprehensive view of southeast asia having lived in thailand and the philippines for seven years neher shows clear understanding of the present situations in the region neher points out that there is great diversity in the region other than geographical proximity and a colonial past there is little that link the nations in this region to be seen as a coherent whole the primary focus of the book deals mostly with the process of modernization especially within the twentieth century up to the time of his writing and how the southeast asian countries fit in the new international era thus the whole outlook of the book deals almost exclusively with political and economic developments since the world war ii after a brief introduction to the region and its emergent importance in the international scene neher gives an overview of each of the ten southeast nations namely thailand the philippines indonesia malaysia singapore brunei burma vietnam cambodia and laos however the report on each nation was not evenly dealt with i feel that a disproportionate coverage was given to thailand and the philippine compared to the other nations his overview of these two nations took up almost pages whereas only pages were given to the remaining eight nations this does not reflect good scholarship when the author did not provide a reason for it especially when one realizes that the author had actually resided in these two countries for seven years furthermore although the third edition was published in most of the latest updates were given up to early most of these additions were single paragraph add ons of news without further analysis a reader seeking understanding of the latest development of the financial crisis finds little helpful understanding of the situation one would expect better analysis of the situation since it has far reaching consequences in the global scene this lack of coverage betrays the intent of the author to present southeast asia in the new international era and the fact that it was revised in one serious mistake was the addition of a paragraph detailing political change in in indonesia by mistake in the section that deals with malaysia neher s presentation gives a lucid account on how each of the southeast asian countries grappled with democratization in the postwar era as each was trying to gain economic and political stability for example in thailand the traditional culture of venerating the monarch gives it unique stability even in the face of numerous coups and military rule the king intervened successfully in each case thus was able to avert bloodshed even when the country went through many changes of government in recent years southeast asia has enjoyed relative peace and stability that brought economic boom to the region such economic success did not occur evenly in all the southeast asian countries burma laos and cambodia remained isolated while indonesia has its fare share of political unrest however as the author points out most of the southeast asian nations are moving fast though each at different pace toward modernization

practical models for corporate environmental strategies i bought this book while writing my under graduation final project in corporate environmental strategies which was later published in a brazilian magazine called industrial ecology the book changed the way i see environmentalism in a very important way it made me stop discussing about the real state of the world and start worrying about improving it in those times i had read the skeptical environmentalist by bjorn lomborg and the ultimate resource by julian simon which are great books in my opinion i started to understand that the most important is not to define where we stand but to make the world a better place graedel and allenby propose practical and detailed strategies in order to green the production process they start the book with a really unbiased discussion about environmentalism and slowly provide the context for the introduction of environmental processes into the industrial world full table of contents below the text is written in a very clear and didactic way and the technical terms are explained from a zi strongly recommend this book for engineers environmentalists managers biologists and people who want to improve the world s environment table of contents humanity and environment the industrial ecology concept technological change and evolving risk the relevance of biological ecology to technology the status of resources society and culture governments laws and economics industrial product design and development industrial process design and operation choosing materials designing for energy efficiency product delivery environmental interactions during product use design for end of life an introduction to life cycle assessment the lca impact and interpretation stages streamlining the lca process using the corporate industrial ecology toolbox managing industrial ecology in the corporation indicators and metrics services technology and environment industrial ecosystems metabolic and resource analysis systems analysis models and scenario development earth systems engineering and management the future of industrial ecology appendix a electronic solder alternatives a detailed case study appendix b units of measurement in industrial ecology glossaryindex 
powerful and unforgettable gods and generals is an extremely well done and fascinating book the author jeff shaara did an excellent job of interpreting the characters his task was a difficult one because his father s book the killer angels is a classic in the chronicles of civil war stories this book precedes the one written by his father gods and generals takes the reader to the beginning of the civil war and through many of the battles the major players in the story are winfield scott robert e lee stonewall jackson winfield hancock and lawrence chamberlain the career biographies of these famous men were striking after reading of their early lives and service experiences it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the union army they were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends i listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by dick estell he brought the characters to life by his narration this book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history 
a worthwhile good book a nice book ! well writen and there is a lot of substance here this is a very useful reference book and although a bit weak in the maps of the th century especially maps of america interest it is overall worthwhile and a good source of old map information

this word damnation terrifies not him christopher marlowe is awsone what other renaissance writer was a freakin spy i mean i like shakespeare s plays and all but as a person he s boring unless he s being played by joseph fiennes i often pit two historical figures against one another in my mind and i wonder what would happen if these two fought if shakespeare and marlowe fought marlowe would bust out his super secret digital watch thats secretly a laser and he d slice shakespeare in half maybe speare would have a deadly quill like the joker had in batman but a deadly quill versus a laser i think we know who would win i know the digital watch laser is a bit silly because they didn t have digital watches back then but at the very least he d have an hourglass with a secret laser reading dr faustus i realize what a shame it is marlowe died so early marlowe s ability to combine drama and comedy was light years ahead of shakespeare s it wasn t until the second half of shakespeare s career that he started writing dark comedies but marlowe was interjecting his humor with a dark twist right away with plays like dr faustus and the jew of malta if marlowe hadn t dies so early in a fight over who was going to pay the bill no less freakin cool then maybe there would have been two playwriting giants in london competing against one another just imagine the masterpieces that would have ensued i bet they would have made king lear look like a comedy of errors this is the second time i ve read dr faustus and i had forgotten how anti catholic it is the story takes place mostly in wittenberg germany where martin luther wrote his famous theses the location already sets up the tenuous relationship between protestants and catholics this relationship obviously biased against catholics is further represented in the good angel and bad angel that appear to dr faustus several times the good angel repeats over and over to dr faustus that he can repent at any time and come back into good graces while the bad angel keeps on telling him it s too late the obvious analogy is that the good angel represents the protestant idea of justification by faith not surprisingly one of the groups of people who marlowe is rumored to have spied on were catholics intent on overthrowing what they saw as england s protestant government furthermore the first thing dr faustus does when he makes his famous bargain is to play a practical joke on the pope please if you re catholic don t let this turn you away from reading this beautifully written play at times the mixture of slapstick comedy and high brow allusions are a bit uneven but that was the nature of the beast back then marlowe had to play to the peasants as well as royalty the trick marlowe plays on the audience is even greater than the trick played on faustus marlowe actually gets us to care about faustus by the end of the play this is either a trick to show us how close every one of us is to making a faustian bargain or it s a trick to show us how unfair these religious traditions were after all what did faustus do that was so wrong he goes into the deal with plans for making himself a despot and ends up using all of his power to fetch grapes for debutants and summon helen of troy so that others may see her beauty dr faustus has phenominal cosmic power and all he can manage is playing a few practical jokes and impressing people with out of season fruits he s never punished for his bad acts but rather because of who he pledged his allegiance to over the course of twenty four years faustus has actually become a somewhat better person if only because he recognizes his sins his greatest crimes are nothing more than playing practical jokes on peasants he s not perfect but he s also not deserving of eternal damnation i see dr faustus as a critique of religion others may find that it only reinforces their beliefs and that s what makes the text so good the faustian bargain finds its way into literature time and again but it means something different to each author likewise dr faustus means something different to each reader 
great book great story a must read biography of one of the most important artists of the country a book about a black woman fine artist telling her story is a rare find and unsurprisingly interesting poignant insightful triumphant 
for love of gold the burden of the miser scathingly told marcel proust famously said of balzac he hides nothing he says everything a more fitting quote has never been attributed to this visionary of the mid th century this paragon and paradox who at the age of thirty declared that he would devote his life to a chronicle of his contemporary era classifying the social strata of france through narrative balzac went on to write more than ninety novels of his self styled human comedy the deliberate rival and successor to dante s vast metaphorical triumph a handful of which are rightly considered to be among the utmost achievement of classical literature balzac s ego was as vast as his ambition and his talent and he considered pretended portrayal shallow platitudes to disguise interior deficiencies as vain and unworthy in his art balzac sought to consolidate and epitomize whatever themes he worked on at the time drawing inspiration from his own experiences and multifold resources if henry james is correct in his claim that balzac s great glory stemmed from the fact that he pretended hardest through the combination of overwork and intuition then his unique status is assured on that effort alone but we have his works to draw on all ninety three of them to reassure that balzac s spirit and intent were pure in other words the art of complete representation few can match the french genius in this regard each of balzac s novels tackle a different theme of the human condition and in eugenie grandet written in the subject of avarice is contemplated and devastatingly revealed through the author s usual concoction of dry wit scathing portrayal minutiae obsession and omniscient understanding balzac s perspective is that of the all seeing all knowing godhead third eye simultaneously deconstructing and putting into perspective the actions and consequences of the miser in all his sordid gold grasping compulsion it s difficult to second guess or place doubt upon the fiery condemnations explicit in this text just brace yourself for the ride and expect the grunts of agreement the surprised whistles and the startled outbursts of laughter that inevitable result from a tour through this man s prodigious mind entering balzac is to confront oneself with genius to learn and be humbled and be entertained lest i forget in ways rarely qualified by his contemporaries it is this humorous quality implicit in his contemplation of human nature that endear balzac so close to my heart even when you know events are going to turn badly as they so often do the rare psychological and sociological insight of the author so keen pessimistic yet never despairing buoy one across the tides of tragedy i loathe to speak too much of the interior text of any balzac novel which in turn always somewhat hinders my attempt at review for it is my belief that the shape and scope of each particular episode of the human comedy should be discovered by the diligent reader with as little knowledge about the text as possible therein to reduce spoiling the impact of the narrative a foolish desire i know and a standard overview of the surface is necessary thus eugenie grandet tells the tale of the quintessential miser monsieur grandet a man who as another reviewer accurately depicted is a caricature of money grubbers everywhere but what a caricature ! one cannot help feel as much amused as disgusted by grandet s penny pinching and wily business shenanigans which include the affectation of a stammer to throw off opponents shady negotiations to curtail any forced obligations and casual back stabbing of his compatriots when there is coin to be made the portrait is made complete with massive amounts of gloating and caressing of his gold behind closed doors grandet lives to make money and to have as little of it leave his possession as possible thus reducing his immediate family to a state of penury entailing shaved lumps of sugar a ban on fires for most of the year an utter lack of decorative excess and a strict rationing of bread and water as the main constituent jam being an outrageous luxury ! madame grandet and her daughter eugenie suffer like saints in this condition ignorant of any other sort of lifestyle at least until cousin charles grandet of paris appears at the door one day a dandy whose finery and extravagance shocks the elder grandet and bewitches the deprived eugenie from here i will reveal no more except to say that grandet s miserly affliction condemns his offspring even from beyond the grave avarice becomes a hereditary endowment unconsciously applied though the daughter shy and virginal continually exerts her generous nature despite the installed programming giving a faint ray of charitable bliss to the grim consequence of the denouement in all of his novels balzac peppers the narrative with observational asides and digressions enhancing the story with the reflections of earned experience the beginning of love and the beginning of life have a pleasing likeness to one another is it not everyone s concern to lull a child with soothing songs and kind looks to tell him stories of wonders that paint the future with gold for him are not hope s dazzling wings always spread for his delight does he not shed tears of joy as well as grief and grow impatient about nothing about the stones with which he tries to build an unsteady palace about the flowers forgotten as soon as picked is he not eager to grasp time and put it behind him to get on with his business of life love is the soul s second metamorphosis pgs it is these moments of internalized perception brought forth from quill to parchment that bring the events surrounding into perspective that make balzac an author to be poured over analyzed with delight to be read again and again eugenie grandet deserves its place next to lost illusions the black sheep pere goirot and cousin bette at the forefront of the human comedy and literature in general highly recommended 
comprehensive review of fundamental concepts the book gives the fundamentals of risk management you can grasp the idea of duration convexity and other commonly used terms the book especially tells how you will use the terms not to derive them i recommend the book it is indeed usefu 
great reference this book is not for the beginner it is not for someone who doesn t already have a modicum of elementary probability as part of his blood and bones it is not for those without a functional knowledge of multivariate integration and the transformations involved therein just as for any mathematical statistics textbook mathematical competence is critical in deriving utility in fact outside some set theoretic properties a topic such as this is all about applying methods from linear algebra multivariable calc this is not a probability textbook in the vein of stephen ross whose first course in probability would be best to consult for certain topics this text too requires calculus in short look elsewhere first if you re incompetent but then return return to this wonderfully complete and rigourous txt that offers challenging end of chapter exercises and insures that if you look something up you will find it the contents is vast and each time you open it you re likely to walk away with something new or something appreciated fully for the first time misses the th star because of its list of errata and because newer editions haven t been forthcoming it could use one more revision 
a good above the middle below the top quite a nice little book on rereading i rated it higher than the first time 
can t be better simply put the best spanish novel of the eighties intense witty perfect 
david sedaris at his best this book marked a departure from sedaris previous works in that it was mostly a memoir and there was very little fiction in it david sedaris adventure and misadventures in college hitch hiking plus candid moments in his family history and as an apple picker processor is both entertaining and piognant many think of sedaris as a humorist but there a many keen observations about life in his writing i especially liked his account of his visit to a straight nudist camp 
florence comes alive this is a must read for anyone planning a vacation to florence or for those wanting to experience the place and time without the expense as martines reaches far beyond the story of a single man and into renassiance florence readers will find this gripping and complex historical drama impossible to put down april blood the pazzi conspiracy against the medici sets the stage for this great book and martines combines expert scholarship with dramatic narrative skill in both works 
good but this is an excellent book which shows how young christians of all stripes are returning to their theologically conservative roots i felt that the anecdotal comments from these new faithful were very enlightening especially when they explain why they hold the theological views that they do my only disappointment however is that while carroll includes young persons from many points in the broader catholic tradition be they roman orthodox or anglican she totally ignores lutherans even when introducing individuals who are pentecostal and baptist are there none of these new faithful among the lutherans was she unable to find them or has she given up on the lutheran church in any case such a serious omission of a major catholic communion is certainly lamentable and results in a much lower rating than would have otherwise been deserved 
a classic novel a timeless novel about the rights of the individual and our own mortality 
best in many ways i received this book as a gift a few years ago and have used it often the recipe s are imaginative easy and always well recieved by family and guests the recipe s ingredients are basic and credible and of course the presentation in this book is a knockout ! the food the scenery the dishware all top drawer 
like watching a train wreck you know that your fascination is morbid but you can t tear your eyes away from the awfulness of it the sheer ghoulish drama unfolding before you like some sick joke of the gods i remember the first time i watched this play i believe it was lee marvin s portrayal of hickey on a presentation of american playhouse i was held from first to last with that jaw gaping awe that only the best dramatic works can inspire this is a rare work of the highest measure it combines its existential angst with portrayals so uncluttered that we are spared the usual contortions of the literati to be sure there is symbolism and allusion enough the entire play takes place in a bar called hope the setting is a meat packing district literally the most dead end of dead ends hickey sells for a living a profession that trades on hopes and fears but these are just passing nods to the writer s craft o neill includes them to keep the acolytes happy the story depends on neither its setting nor its devices it would work as well set in some professional clubs i know this play is concerned with the necessity of delusions the various characters assembled around the bar waiting for hickey s appearance are different flavours of delusion it s like dante s inferno with each character defining a different circle of hell and when hickey shows up his effect is not much short of satan sno one could write a play like this today we have become a society so steeped in cool cynicism that we have lost our authenticity today a theme like o neills could only be invoked with a veiled smirk think of all the recent movies that have dealt with this thesis they are either clich d cruel or contemptuous consider for example american beauty delusion is a topic we approach with patronizing disdain for fear of seeming earnest what is the line between delusion and hope is hope itself delusional perhaps all humans are fundamentally flawed and can only avoid despair by wrapping ourselves in a cloak of unreality and fantasy hope is a crutch avoidance is therapy unflinching reality leads only to death or to madness heavy stuff it doesn t matter whether you agree or disagree with o neills thesis because this play wasn t written to advance a specific point of view it was written to exorcise demons all of o neills great plays were to varying degrees products of his suffering this one came closest to connecting his personal pain with universal aspects of the human condition this theme scares us because we are all so very vulnerable to self delusion and o neills unsparing scrutiny exposes our own fear and pain so candidly that we are forced into self reflection and humility this empathy is at the heart of all the great tragedies we could be as foolish as lear as jealous as othello as ambitious as faust or as delusional as hickey don t set yourself higher than these figures there but for the grace of god go i 
the gift i would rank this book in the most important i have read his study of gift giving throughout history and with different cultures changed my entire view of how we give and receive gifts 
brilliant multi layered storytelling my first gore vidal novel and absolutely not my last i rarely have time to read as much as i like but over the last week and a half i have carved time out at all hours of the day to get back to this book i am a fan of history and historical fiction and this is the good stuff without doubt other reviews will give you the book report summary of plot and device but i am here to tell you that the layers of commentary in this book were breathtaking vidal s personality seeps up through every page so subtly that on many occassions i found myself doing in essence double takes turning back a page or two and thinking hang on did he just and inevitably the commentary the literary slight of hand the double meaning and the three and four layer references i suspected were all there i can only guess how many i may have missed as you know by now this book is about the death of a king the life and times of a leader who was dedicated to rejuvinating a divided country a man whose mission required the unification of a nation divided along religious and political lines it is the story of a leader who was assasinated after holding power for just three short years vidal ends his novel with this april january romethis is a reference i am sure to the period during which he wrote it it is also a reference to the dating of julian s journal entries but i believe this date range specifically its terminus serves another typically subtle purpose it is a reference to another historical leader one who strove to reinvigorate a faded empire one who inspired similar division in his country and one who met a similar tragic end i believe that this book is a farewell of sorts to john f kennedy read it it s amazing 
queen of the vampires this is an excellant book pure and simple it may not be all vampire but you can relate to what lestat feels in this novel so it hits you on somewhat of a personal level i highly recommend this book once again once again rice manages to do it this book was just as wonderful as all the others i don t think i ve ever come across a vampire book so ensightful definate reading 
true to form man i just love king george ! i really couldn t tell you how many times i could read and re read his song of fire and ice series this is a great filler while you are painfully waiting for the feast the artwork is so well down in this extended comic book characters are introduced that are prequels to the future series the names will definitely ring a bell if you are familiar to the series this was just a well done short story full of sacrifice back stabbing characters that are more than they appear basically everything you would expect from mr martin just in condensed form a must read for martin fans 
the standard reference deservedly discursive and authoritative the one failing is the lack of convenient text search when available on cd rom with that capability it will be an ideal reference 
a scientific approach to a religious riddle evil anyone interested in grappling with the all the hate in this world and in their own hearts should read this book watson breaks down human aggression into something our genes command us to do to keep themselves alive who s really in control here only by understanding our genetic enslavement watson argues will we ever be able to rise above it the book is wonderfully free of new age b s and religious moralizing it casts a bright light on a dark and slimy subject the end result for the reader at least this one is a deep understanding of what makes our dark hearts tick 
wanted more of the scot i did enjoy the book i liked the time with patrick leslie but i wanted more of logan thought he was a good character that got lost the end of the book was so hurried 
none dare call it treason is our current administration intentionally lying yes fog facts is about key data evaporating into obscurity fog facts is not a right or left wing propaganda book this is an anti propaganda book professor douglas rushkoff recently published that the best way to help the masses see the truth is to speak plainly game on beinhart has filled this bill in wag the dog beinhart taught me more about propaganda than i had learned from multiple other texts fog facts reveals the path that lead to our modern state of mass delusion so long as most americans keep seeing the other side as responsible for corruption our current media system is secure the greatest trick our media has pulled is the illusion of the two party system both sides are ignoring fundamental lies and unprecedented changes to our constitution the two sides is two faces of the same machine when humans are two faced we don t trust them harry blackstone used to walk a live elephant on stage and nobody would see him do that it appeared as magic beinhart explains how crucial facts are lead on to the main stage of mass media without anybody seeming to notice presto the world has changed media is not the magic by misdirection i was envisioning it is a mass willingness to suspend disbelief thank you larry for helping me better understand the mechanism however i don t think you have gone far enough heads of media should be fired for misrepresenting the facts those that forged data should be charged with treason those that ordered the data be forged should be charged with crimes against humanity but as you point out they changed the courts to preclude this possibility if this book disappears without debate it will simply be one more bit of evidence to show the fix is in 
a book for pleasure and engagement i absolutely adored this book philosophy most would agree isn t read for entertainment but edification of some sort it enlightens it provokes it challenges but it feels at times like eating spinach delicious for its nutrients rather than its unadulterated taste alain de botton however manages to make philosophy relevant and readable no i take that back his philosophizing is positively delightful status anxiety is an examination of the incessant concern of one s standing in the world de botton suggests that we desire two kinds of love the love of our close friends and family and the love of the world at large this need to be adored by humanity is a subject that the sophisticated and well mannered among us are loath to admit or discuss it may be crass to speak of but people tend to value themselves and their accomplishments only as much as other people do we assign ourselves the value we see in the mirror of other people s approval the frequent externalizing of our self worth the author argues is the cause of enormous human anxiety without doing alain de botton the disservice of butchering his well organized tour through human status anxiety and the possible solutions offered by philosophy art and culture i will merely commend this wonderful book to all 
he answers just like he writes let s face it if you like bukowski hank for those who really adore him nothing is too much you probably have already read quotbukowski a life quot by neeli cherkovski and most of his books and if like him like i do you have read them all several times and every time you finish one of his books you say to yourself quoti want more quot well now you got it ! fernanda pivano asks the right questions and hank answers them just like he wrote his best books sometimes he s funny sometimes he s mean sometimes he s sincere but always you have truth his truth at least so buy this book buy some beers and read it you ll have just one problem you ll want more 
a talented writer i had the pleasure of being one of hudson s students especially when i was able to discuss the pilot on the dust jacket capt field e kindley of gravette arkansas one of the first americans flying in a us unit to shoot down a german hudson took great pains to insure the accuraccy of this book and continued to seek out information about the men and units he wrote about in this book it is the book on the fledgling american air service and having been a wwii fighter pilot hudson wrote from a pilot s point of view and was able to discuss the salient points and the bad points of the experiences that these men had and how it shaped the future of our air force i strongly recommend it to any serious military student 
mobius strip this is the beginning of the posthumous work of mishima you will follow the lives of four people who got reincarnated in different time and in different place with honda his flowing and elegant style hits the highest and psychological descriptions that even characters did not realized themselves so well are so elaborated and sometimes scare us it seems like weaving beautiful tapestry and you can feel the person of genius and bliss for enjoying the output of the genius but you may lost at the end like this story and come back to this story again and again 
inspiring informative and good karma this is one of the best books i ve read about the business of voiceovers and i ve read them all hearing how they did it from some of the best performers in the country makes for a fascinating read but there s plenty of real world information from the artists as well including marketing tips studio conduct union membership and the art of the craft i appreciate that the proceeds of this book are being donated to the alzheimer s association as a voiceover performer myself i m acutely aware that the word voice means much more than simply an instrument for talking the voice is the means by which we convey our soul it is the stream of our identity successful voiceover performers such as those featured in this book are able to convey emotion and heart through their work and the listener has a sense of who they are from the way they shape the words all of us who make a living in this business have contemplated losing our voices but for an alzheimer s patient the loss of voice is much more profound than losing the ability to communicate it is the loss of identity using a book focused on voiceovers as a means to fight a disease that robs its victims of their voices is inspiring and very creative for voice performers this book is a wonderful addition to your personal library if you already make a living using your voice or hope to purchasing this book is an investment youre paying it forward as you learn from the best in the business 
a riveting read refiner s fire combines a gripping story line with well drawn characters and a real sense of the time and place in which they live the book held me captive to the very last paragraph and is particularly fascinating to anyone with an interest in romania highly recommended to anyone who enjoys adventure 
great book i will reccomend this book to anyone ! this is one of the best books ! 
always expect the charm of the south to shine through in novels from fannie flagg welcome to the world baby girl ! is another entry in flagg s catalog of southern fiction the story jumps around in time between the life of famous glamorous tv personality dena nordstrom in the present day s and the history of dena s hometown of elmwood springs missouri circa the s and s as a jaded northerner dena avoids her past and her association with a backwater place in missouri the story of elmwood springs is also the story of dena s upbringing and the disappearance of her mother but dena knows nothing of it the reader however is certain to be charmed by elmwood springs especially radio personality neighbor dorothy who we are introduced to in the first pages of the novel longtime residents norma and mackey warren denas cousins provide delightful dialog and antics and show their love to dena when she returns home after a long absence the title of the novel is perfect dena thought she was worldly and all knowing when she was on top of the ny television world in reality there was a whole world in little old elmwood springs that she needed to learn about to become a complete person the reason i m giving this stars instead of a perfect is that flagg wrote the book to lead up to a major twist about dena s past some of the narration and dena s behavior on the way to this twist is a little weak the reader might even get disheartened with the novel in the middle because of the dragging out of the lead up to dena uncovering her past once flagg gets into it however the reader will say aha so that was where she was trying to go ! 
facinating i can t believe i didn t know anything about this time in us history before the chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating this book is very well written you d think a book about architecture might be dry but its really not at all highly recommend this book its a slo a great book for a book club

a critical mass of critics i was just out of graduate school and working in my first professional position when the first star wars movie now known as episode came out i loved it i had been a confirmed pulp sf addict since the mid s and i was predisposed to enjoy the film for what it was not for what the critics thought it was and what they apparently wanted me as a card carrying intellectual to believe it was but i m not too proud to admit that i also loved a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind when they came out i mean this stuff is great fun right the stuffier film critics though decided that george lucas had killed the movies just as there were cries of anguish back in the late s when the movies began to talk yes the star wars universe has had a great influence on culture and not just pop culture but so have gucci and ronald reagan and mcdonald s most of the contributors to this anthology are of an age to have grown up on star wars and the distinction can easily be made between those who don t take it or themselves too seriously jonathem lethem neal pollack erika krouse and elwood reed and those for whom lucas is evil incarnate notably arion berger and tom carson the book is an interesting read for those like me with an interest in film making and screenwriting that goes beyond just sitting there with a bag of popcorn but i could only shake my head at some of the breast beating jeremiads

my first exposure to franzen franzen writes in such an evenhanded tone that it is hard to imagine anyone being mad at him he is by turns incisive thoughtful and intellectual but his terrain is a personal one in which he reflects on himself and his reaction to the modern world hardly the stuff of polemics as the cliche goes though beauty is only skin deep and where i see at worst banal observations about franzen s attempts to make sense of his disconnectedness from the world he finds people who react to him negatively those who call him an elitist or an intellectual do not like the fact that he has used the word diurnality in his prose now here s a curious phenomenon franzen an author who seems quite at odds with the modern world achieves success in the form of an endorsement from oprah winfrey ophah winfrey who could hardly be less controversial and more banal than franzen endorsed his novel the corrections suddenly franzen had more publicity than he had ever had before a film crew wanted him to go back to his childhood house in st louis and he started receiving hate mail from those self satisfied mensches in the midwest who do not like the diurnality in his prose what do we have here well i m not an earnest person and my admittedly cynical take on this whole scenario which at once seems to befuddle and concern franzen is that many people who could charitably be called casual readers have their choices distilled for them by oprah in general this is an admirable goal anything that increases the amount people read has to be a good thing if we accept that reading itself is intrinsically good but a unexpected problem arises when you are dealing with a person like winfrey winfrey is successful because of her safe banality she does not to use a cliche push boundaries nor does she demand much of her viewers her im ok you re ok rhetoric has earned her millions in both fans and dollars thus we have the endorsement of a novel like the corrections which as i understand it explores the existential angst of three smug self absorbed urbanites who in certain ways pine for the quotidian pleasures that their suburban parents take for granted all well and good but ahh that writing the demands the heavy use of abstruse words why diurnality why not just daily or some such other simple immediately accessible word we want our reading like we want our oprah ! spoonfed to us so we know what to think what to feel and how to react therein lies franzen s troubles he wants to be alone in the world to think to cogitate to enjoy language and the written word and well everyone else seems to want the artifice of american pop culture

mysticism without obfuscation what i love best about scholem is that he wrote eloquently about spiritual enlightenment without presenting himself as being a mystical master or guru he will guide you through the history of jewish esoteric thought after which you can sample some source texts many of which now are available in english translation no preaching here just good scholarly thought and clear eloquent writing it s also amazing how a year old volume remains the standard introduction while still being regarded as controversial in fundamentalist quarters an awesome achievement

the madness behind the mask high flying fast living f scott fitzgerald attained great commercial and critical fame early in life and then began a rapid fall into a ferocious alcoholism in the great gatsby now regarded as his masterpiece and often described as the great american novel was published to only mildly enthusiastic reviews and sold poorly in order to fund the lifestyle to which he had grown accustomed fitzgerald set aside his next book length project and turned to short stories and the occasional bout of writing for hollywood although fitzgerald began to formulate ideas for tender is the night as early as the project was slow to take form and was not published until by which time it had become a reflection of fitzgerald s stormy marriage to the equally high flying fast living zelda sayre who gradually sank into insanity and was permanently institutionalized by the early s originally published in serial form in scribner s magazine it received mixed reviews and when it was published as a novel it did not prove the great commercial success fitzgerald hoped it was the last novel he completed before his death the story is set in europe where the fitzgeralds themselves lived through much of the s and begins with rosemary a very young woman who has recently jolted to fame and fortune as an actress in silent film beautiful but in many respects innocent rosemary vacations on the riviera where she makes the acquaintance of dick and nicole diver an incredibly wealthy exceptionally attractive couple who seem to be the height of all the modern era has to offer rosemary quickly subcums to dick diver s immeasurable charm and falls in love with him but nick is determinedly bound to nicole as much from responsibility as love nicole s apparent flawlessness is a facade dick is a psychiatrist his wife nicole is also his patient she is insane fitzgerald was often accused of writing about rich and pretty but trivial people in one sense this is true but in fitzgerald s work the shiny surface is precisely that a false front that the characters present to the world in order to maintain both their social standing and self image as the novel moves back and forward in time we see how dick has been bought by nicole s family and how he is repeatedly torn between love for nicole as a husband and care for her as a patient so that even as nicole begins a final recovery he begins his own destruction sucked dry by the endless personal and professional compromises required of him increasingly dark in tone tender is the night is not so much disillusioning as it is ultimately painfully nhilistic fitzgerald seemed to regard tender is the night as both his most personal and his favorite work and there are few who would not regard it as a masterpiece even so it is very much a flawed masterpiece occasionally problematic to a point at which it snaps the reader out of the very reality it attempts to create most often due to fitzgerald s own authorial self indulgence that said the characters and their situations are not always as convincing as one could wish and the structure of the novel is occasionally muddy and yet even with these glaring issues running throughout the novel tender is the night is the sort of book that you think you will not finish and then suddenly find yourself on the last page whereas the great gatsby tended to focus on the mask tender is the night focuses on the face beneath it and the result is uniquely powerful you care about the divers and even though you sense their ultimate fate you like they themselves fight against it it has moments of brilliance as powerful and often more so than any other novel of the first half of the th century strongly recommended gft amazon reviewe

quota highly polished mind quot reflections presents for the reader the great range that benjamin had as a writer critic and occidentalist this collection further demonstrates benjamin s acute awareness of the literature of his time as evidenced by his essay on surrealism which is as fine a reflection on its themes as the manifestos of andre breton furthermore his writings and conversations with bertolt brecht show benjamin to be very close to the thinking of the author himself also included is his celebrated essay on karl kraus quotthe jewish swift of vienna quot but what i like most about this collection are the amorphisms and autobiographical sketches of marseilles and oneway street in his images of marseilles benjamin creates an quotexegesis of the city quot that is as fine as any poet could offer spellbinding acute and beautiful as well his wit and insight into social phenomena is detailed in oneway street and also in the piece on moscow which lets the western reader experience a rare witnessing of the russian city in the years after the revolution in a way that recalls dziga vertov finally the inclusion of several pieces of benjamin s philosophical theological speculations show that he was a man of great breath and wisedom and further showcase the wide range of his highly polished mind

brilliant or real horrorshow as alex would say you would think that it would be impossible to write a book about a year old rapist murderer and somehow have him come out as a sympathetic character burgess has achieved that remarkable feat in this book the genius of it is in the use of the first person and in the use of slang to give voice to alex the slang also serves to make the violence almost comical as instead of kicking someone in the mouth alex describes giving a tolchok into the rot and knocking out a few zoobies so even though the book is full of violence and rape the language removes us from it in such a way that the book feels less violent than it is although this may seem like it would make the book hard to read it all makes sense when read in context the story itself is a fairly simple and fast read if you have seen the movie then other than the last chapter you know what happens in the book alex and his friends commit violent crimes alex gets arrested he gets cured of his violence and then gets cured of the cure the movie follows the book almost exactly the key difference is that the original american edition left out the last chapter the american publisher thought it was a sellout as burgess explains in the introduction and kubrick followed the american edition of the book is the last chapter a sellout does it cheapen the book i think it changes the story to some extent burgess suggested that it changed the book from a fantasy into a novel i think this overstates it but if you have read the american edition without the last chapter then you need to read it again with the last chapter the book is a classic and should be required reading although adult in concept and story line anyone old enough to read the daily paper is old enough to read this book beneath all the violence in the book burgess is trying to make a point about free will and what it means to be human but he doesn t overstate it the story and the language carry the reader and the message is just there to do with as you please as burgess says in the introduction eat this sweetish segment or spit it out you are free 
great book but what a challenge love in the present tense by morrie and arleah shechtman presents ideas that are so intuitively obvious at least in retrospect that i found myself wondering why i hadn t written the book myself with more reflection i wondered why i hadn t been following their precepts for years i suppose the answer at least to the second question is that what they propose is hard it demands more than probably most of us are willing to give but having acknowledged the difficulty involved i believe they have written the best relationship self help book of recent years they are on to something and the prospective reader would be well served by finding out what it is 
excellent comprehensive resource this work is an excellent overview of islamic societies also it is highly readable for a history book of course it can get dull at times just as all really detailed history books must but this work remains highly lucid throughout the strongest breakthrough of this book concerns its treatment of the arabization of middle east and the developement of what we know as the modern arab identity however to typify in a few sentence as book of this scope is impossible once you read it you will find yourself going it back to it again and again for reference and for understanding modern events

how the west was lost this is a fantastic classic detailing the demise of the plains indians and deals with them incident by incident tribe by tribe chief by chief from around the s to the early th century if the only good indian was a dead indian and if civilisation was to prevail this book is a stark examination of the lack of morality in the process or at least the victory of might and legality over right one thing never mentioned in discussions about the us war of independence is that the british wished to maintain treaties with the indians and protect their land rights wheareas the washingtonians were already in the process of making a land grab before the war took place the indians took the side of the british and they had hell to pay long afterwards as they were wiped off the face of america along with the bison geronimo sitting bull and custer s last stand read about it here 
bringing the holocaust back down to individual tragedies in some ways joseph stalin was right when he said the death of one person is a tragedy the death of millions is a statistic millions of people were killed in the event now referred to as the holocaust yet to truly grasp it one must consider each of those people as an individual with a life loves and aspirations it is only by reducing the holocaust down to this level that we will keep the emotional attachment needed to keep the memories alive this book describes some of the events in a jewish family in germany as hitler rose to power and began the program of persecution against the jews there are the early years where most jews believed that hitler was someone who rose quickly and would fall even faster after that there were years of living in fear as the gangs of nazi thugs freely destroyed jewish property and engaged in intimidation the blumenthal family also experienced a series of disappointments as they were granted permission to emigrate to the united states and moved to the netherlands in anticipation of their departure after months in a refugee camp they became prisoners again when germany invaded the netherlands they were then transported to the beren belsen camp where thousands died although it was not a true death camp after the war those who were still alive managed to make it to the united states where they finally ended up in peoria illinois this is a story of death destruction disappointment in the actions of others and finally building a new life in an unfamiliar place it is a triumph of the human spirit and reduces the statistic of six million deaths back down to the level of a tragedy 
cool creepy crawlers after reading some of the naysayers petty complaints about this book i almost didn t get it wow am i glad i did i read a lot and a lot of good literature paul auster ian mcewan graham greene etc and the ruins alhtough certainly not great literature was a real corker ! i could not put it down all the comments about the characters being shallow dumb irritating were lost on me they acted like any privileged year olds would and as for suspending belief i only once was a little disappointmed when they left the cab truck driver without any notion of how they were to get back to town other than that well who says plants can t hear see think and most of all eat humans shades of little shop of horrors but without the humour i was glued to my couch non stop with this one why anyone would have a difficult time just enjoying the hell out of such a creepy and scary book i do no know no immediate plans for a trip to the jungle for me after the ruins i loved it and truly hated to see it end but of course it didn t end did it 
another view of jfk most of kennedy s biographers fall into two camps hagiographers like goodwin and schlesinger and dozens of others or much more honest examinations of the character of the man like thomas reeves very good book the hags have outnumbered the wags by at least ten to one but this book is a good addition to the latter camp this way toolong book has many good examples of how jfk really did not have some burning commitment to civil rights or much of anything else for that matter and was really a fairly shallow man with good speech writers who could turn a phrase and have kennedy deliver it with passion his willingness to appoint segregationists such as william cox to the federal bench and his friendships with senate bigots such as al gore sr and bill clinton s hero william fulbright shows him to be far less the advocate of civil rights than his hagiographers have made him out to be much of this book is focused on the civil rights for blacks movement but there are some good insights into other issues that were front and center at the time 
europe all is not lost yet anyone wanting a quick way to assets the general merits and intellectual muscle flexed in the book should glance at the chapter headed two ideas of freedom contrasting the secular and sacred versions of freedom with luminous brevity however the general easy reading contemporary nature of the prose will be better gauged from the later chapter the cost of boredom which sums up why white post christian europe cannot be bothered to procreate with sufficient vigour to stem its population decline and our postpolitical wilderness of rule by faceless bureaucrats as an american theologian and the biographer of pope john paul ii george weigel is well placed to speak with perspective on europe s current problems the main thrust of the book is a critique of atheistic secular humanism ash and its many virus variants which have infected the euro russian continent the emphasis is on the th century and picks up the root philosophical and cultural causes of world war i and ii and the rebellion of the les soixante huitards riots with remarkably fluent and coherent reference to western european history as far back as the high middle ages of aquinas and occam and glancing reference much further back the cube is the intellectual symbol of the sterile closed universe ash viewpoint the architectural colossus of la grande arche of paris being an open cube of white marble and glass about stories tall and feet wide the cathedral is the rather more famous church of notre dame which despite its ancient complexities and beauty in spire and tower would fit comfortably inside the grand arch this current edition is dated and probably just missed the rioting and looting and epidemic of car burnouts that afflicted france that year it is difficult to do anything like reviewing justice to this book at one reading but one of the central themes is that western europe is committing a form of demographic suicide p with a general greying of the population and coming universal pensions crisis due to a birthrate being less than the replacement rate he might have added that russia currently has an annual death rate that exceeds the birthrate by but his purpose does not extend to a proper vilification of communism the root cause of our lack of reproductive enthusiasm is analysed to be spiritual nihilism emptiness and lack of purpose in life having rejected the christian roots of our historical culture its criticism of the purblind inability of the eu to see the problem let alone grapple with it will gladden the hearts of those who oppose this political con trick that is the eurozone despite the to me astonishing revelations he makes of the catholic christians who were the architects of the whole scheme he is frequently at pains to trace the intellectual cultural and moral roots of western europe the eastern empire is sparingly but properly referenced and not ignored as is so often the case recently the ruling eu elites totally refused to recognise the christian heritage of europe in the drafting of its word constitutional treaty our roots apparently jumping from the classical civilisation of greece and rome to that of the humanist enlightenment of descartes and kant which merely extracted the parts it liked from christian culture and promptly forgot what it takes to develop and preserve them which is a living faith in a judaeo christian god he invites us to contemplate a striking list of christian scientists artists politicians leaders warriors and philosophers and asks us to imagine europe history itself i would say just consider that we only discovered the gas oxygen about years ago we could not even begin to describe the chemistry of burning or human respiration before this without their contribution and this is a list which is so wide ranging that it includes milton mendel michaelangelo wesley and wilberforce while it omits shakespeare isaac newton handel and dozens of others the other main theme is euro christophobia which is detailed in many ways from the persecutory attitude to the catholic professor rocco buttiglione in his proposed place in the eu government to the universal demand for tolerance which includes rather madly includes rigid intolerance of any discussion of the christian religion or its place in influencing civic society altogether this adds up to the best analysis of secularism that i have ever read the statement of the very obvious that is the underlying theme of the themes is that western european civilisation was built by the catholic church there is more balance and a gentler tone here in the treatment of the subject but the author is generally in line with thomas woods book how the catholic church built western civilisation which is well paired with this one before or after making little difference the only weakness of this book is that it understates its case it would be easy to adduce more evidence of outright damage and incoherence of ash in our literature alone kafka samuel beckett sartre nietzsche camus and then as a whisky chaser consider the intellectual flight from science professor robin dunbar s the trouble with science published in traces the problem in britain back at least twenty years and is still seen in the rapid and ongoing rejection of chemistry and physics in the school system throughout from gcse at to university graduate a trend which is steadily shutting down departments in these subjects as i write my second reading of this book starts right now and i can also see how it would help one or two of my friends with christmas about to hove into view read them and pray 
if on an autumn day a traveller more than any other work this mordantly funny satire reminded me of italo cavino s if on a winter s night a traveller which i read over years ago and still resonates in me even more than things i ve read more recently the episodic incidents now ending now beginning seemingly random but knitted together and well worth the effort the incredible visual sequencesm the memento like jumps and gaps the easily recognizable characterizations and the befuddlement of the central character kept me reading and made me reluctant to close this book once i had finished

there is no question i treated myself to this book for its relationship with and inclusion of many subjects of my interest photography folk bluegrass music roots culture beat culture nyc s art culture exotic travel when i read the description here i thought wow this sounds like one hell of a great book tailored to my passions well it s better than that john cohen is one lucky guy to have witnessed recorded all that s in this book the text is adequately sparse for a page book but well written and provides just enough accompaniment for the fascinating photography reproduced here regardless the title looking through john cohen s eyes is an ecstatic experience taking one away to seemingly faraway times and places especially for someone who was born in the s me there is a story within each image and the large scale of the prints makes you want to crawl inside each one and figure out what s going on it s an italian made book which explains the high quality and it s the best i ve spent since dylan was last in town 
one of the first enlightening books on china china cannot thoroughly be understood from either a western or a chinese viewpoint to grasp its nature requires an orbital historical view of both the west and china says wei wang author of the best selling business title the china executive indeed because of the same approach will hutton has adopted the writing on the wall is one of the first truly enlightening books on china particularly admiring is the author s ambitionto help tilt the balance towards international collaboration contribute to a reappraisal of the so called china threat and a recognition of the situation as an opportunity china requires our understanding and engagement not our enmity and suspicion which could culminate in self defeatingly creating the very crisis we fear because of china s increasing impact on the world anybody who cares about global peace and prosperity should read this book and unlike many other books on china that are meant to terrify you this book will enlighten you !

is everybody happy the real job of the anthologist is not of course to assemble anthologies but to anger and annoy readers only census takers have more doors slammed in their innocent faces that said a few words in defense of this excellent volume yes there s plenty of second tier or third tier verse here and those in search of pure poetry no rocks no soda shaken not stirred should probably save their pennies and buy the loa volumes devoted to frost stevens etc etc but a book like this one does give a splendid sense of cultural context sometimes the giants loom only larger when they re stuck in a line up with their diminutive peers and some of those lesser lights are actually quite talented too so unless you re truly fixated on iambic quality control you should find much to love and even more to like in the capacious and paper thin pages of apttcv

fell short of my high expectations i say it fell short only because when i got this book i hoped it would delve further into alice s life and beyond that into diana s life after reading tagd which is one of my all time favorite novels ms koen hinted strongly at an interesting history for alice and diana and i just knew that a prequel had to come at some point years later it is here and while i loved the book i was dissapointed in that it only spanned a couple of years if that and then ended abruptly at the most interesting time i won t divulge so that non readers won t be spoiled and not one hint of diana so i am wondering if there is such a thing as a second prequel ms koen simply must go further into alice s life after this book ended and definitely introduce us to diana when she was younger i want more ! 
interesting trivia e dhill has interviewed a great many people for this work and has compiled them into a series of interesting anecdote 
outstanding reference ! just about perfect this page classic reference on a difficult and hugely multi faceted subject appears to cover just about every possible area in this huge category ! not only is it a stupendous browser but one can practically read it from start to finish without getting too difficult or scientific for an interested amateur like myself and there are drawings diagrams sketches covering children s art illusions on and on plus short bios of the greats like newton hegelrosseau sartre kant etc etc plus many lessor known but perhaps of equal distinction subjects like religion magic medicine out of body experiences hallucinations are given active note not to mention some less known but still interesting subjects so if you have a chance pick this one up it s also guaranteed to initiate an interest in lots of things you may know absolutely nothing about beforehand ! definitely one of those desert island books that will never go out of style !

smart fun and pleasingly cynical i m at home on bed rest and desperate for something good to read this book did the trick the narrator is smart funny and clearly aware that it is next to impossible to do much about most of the evil sleaziness of the world certainly it is impossible to make changes in individual lives one at a time or maybe i m just jaded too some may call it maturity clearly the narrator is the most decent character in a novel full of morally bankrupt people from both sides of the tracks ironically his career is blindsided due to what others perceive to be questionable morals anyway join max as he watches pathetic people with and without class power and agency screw up their lives even more than they already have and help him make sense of it great literature this ain t but a smart fun cynical read it is 
a cant miss pulp fiction lovers anthology i read adventure vol about two months ago and enjoyed it it s hard to give a sweeping review of an anthology particularly in this book where the stories cover just about every subject found in pulp fiction sci fi horror war hero adventure even a superhero story with that said it is fair to say that there is something for every pulp fan in adventure vol there is an odd tale or two that i just couldn t fathom but that may be a product of my impatient fast reading style and nothing to do with the quality of the story all of the stories are written well by many authors whose names are very familiar to me as a fan of sci fi fantasy and superhero fiction my favorites in no particular order are richard riddle boy detective in the case of the french spy by kim newman silence of the sea by o neil de noux dogfight donovan s day off by michael moorcock and johnny come lately by marc singer richard riddle is an excellent adventure horror tale starring a trio of kids told from their point of view but nonetheless a gripping adult nailbiter silence of the sea brings to mind the writing style of jack london if he had written sci fi dogfight donovan s day off is quite similar to a g or dusty ayres yarn except that the degree of action experienced by the protagonist here makes both those pulp characters look like girl scouts pressing flowers i would very much love to see johnny come lately expanded in to a full length novel in one too short story the author recites a very detailed mythos back story and present plight for a superhero who far exceeds his four color peers in dimension depthtitling a book vol would suggest to me anyway that a vol was in the offing however looking at monkey brain book s the publisher s anticipated releases on their website i don t see an entry for vol that s too bad i think adventure vol is definitely worth a follow up volume respectfullychris yates 
a great realistic overview a very quotdowntoearthquot realistic overview of life with adult children in today s world and the challenges and victories we face together the first pages don t contain a lot of quotmeatquot so skip over it or hang in there for the best part great suggestions ideas true stories and loads of encouragement for both parents with struggling or quotsuccessful kids quot some of my favorities specific examples of how to talk to your kids that would be more effective and get good results such as the chapter quotsix characteristics of a nice no quot another great chapter quotdumb decisions quot theirs which weaves the prodigal son throughout and the last two chapters which focus on reparenting the adult child and passing on the truth this book is an easy read and helpful no matter what your situation

good but ignores or barely touches upon some of their dirtiest secrets good stuff here on the bush family and their many shady dealings going back to the s i mean it really is amazing how interwoven this bunch is with so many of the worst elements of the worlds power brokers for over a years if this book has a weakness its although it brings up many of the the nefarious deeds and dealings of the bush crime family that it barely touches on or completely ignores the worst of the worst that the bushs have been linked to over the years it also tries a bit too hard to try to draw a parrellell between the bush gangsters and european royalty by making them into americans version of a royal family still recomended reading though

terrifically funny wendy mcclure entertains and charms her audience with a collection of witty beautiful and funny tales regarding her personal weight loss battle in im not the new me mcclure begins by telling her audience that every fat girl has a fat story about the trauma that caused the fat but that she will spare us that recollection instead mcclure treats us to a bevy of hysterical anecdotes about her personal weight struggles love life challenges and family dysfunction i found im not the new me to be delightful mcclure s writing is very reminiscent of laurie notaro of whom i am a huge fan i thought this book was engaging and personal while being funny and vulnerable i do hope that mcclure writes additional works because i am really in love with her humor and writing style i highly recommend this book 
a true legend never dies i would just like to say that tupac was a mentor to a alot of young people like myself i have read every book that tupac has written or an auto biographythe words out of tupac s mouth were definitely felt by all of his fans and successors he had so much to say about alot of sensitive subjects that rarely ever get recognized therefore i am giving this and all his material five stars 
bodansky and his think tank outhinking about everyone i ve read bodansky s books are to my opinion the best books written on middle east politics at times you have to wonder where all the information comes from obviously he has contact with inside sources in the middle east who know what is going on and he is not afraid to say what needs to be said about state sponsored terrorism and how it is cynically used without care or consideration for those whom it disastrously harms at times you have to laugh at bodansky s blunt style in assesing mideast politician and dictators motives and methods of operation while you may have to disagree with some of bodansky and his information sources you can t deny that even if he might be wrong at times hes not far off at all as a matter of fact like dennis hopper said of kurtz in apocolypse now he may be crazy but he may be right i would finally say that someone has figured the mideast situation out enough to make sense of it if that could ever be i use bodansky s books all the time when i see a news story on cnn and i have to know what bodansky has to say about it read him cover to cover or use the back index for select topics either way you win youre as close to an expert as you can come now if you can just remember what you read and if you can find someone who ll listen to you like cassandra as i read this book i became aware that bin laden is just the tip of the iceberg on the troubled politics of the middle east bodansky obviously uses the bin laden sideshow as a forum to present even more alarming facts about state sponsored terrorism complete with their networks and multi layers of deniability and financial sources he offers solutions as well 
knowledge this reference from a z on the masonic order is excellent for those seeking apprenticeship or rather initiation into freemasonry the reader will gain vast historical knowledge of the fraternity it s roots rites degrees titles and so forth granted that the book is aged and it s an encyclopaedia so it can get dull for some i find it to be very helpful and it suits the purpose of those who are inclined riddles maybe 
a necessary volume this book along with stanley karnow s quotin our image quot and james hamilton patersons quotamericas boy quot should be a necessary primer on america s tragic flirtation with colonialism at the turn of the century well paced and thoroughly engaging quotbenevolent assimilation quot is as comprehensive and accessible document on the american annexation of the philippines an illegal act that in its time raised serious questions about the very nature of the americam republic and the liberal jeffersonian democracy late th century america putatively still represented the dream of empire and its price in blood is poignantly essayed here the chapters where the united states pursued its brutal racist war of conquest with the consent of american law are wrenching quite sad that there is very little public discussion of this atrocious chapter in our history a full century later thought provoking capable of inducing a kind of soul searching and introspection few events in our history like african slavery and the extermination and continuing disenfranchisement of native americans are capable of provoking essential not just for history buffs but for anyone interested in reading history with an eye to purifying our creed

dick is a bitch moby dick is not a fun book to read the prose is old fashioned and that is partly what vitiates the pleasure cf ivanhoe primarily however it is boring plain and simple there are endless digressions and asides and plot sabbaticals very easy to put down undoubtedly an amazing intellectual feat to pull off hence my five stars but still id estimate that of high schoolers assigned this book end up actually reading it can t blame them either to be fair the last twenty pages when ahab and starbuck have their final tete atete and ahab famously snarls to his finned nemesis from hell s heart i stab at thee do cause a frisson and i don t regret reading the book its a great laurel to rest on but i will never pick it up again eh give er a go if you finish it you ll know that you re a man not a boy

i love these fandex guides a fantastic quotquick amp dirty quot reference tool ! the perfect aid for persons in the online auction selling business for example i had a lovely antique plate that i wanted to put up for auction this particular plate featured a bird sitting in a tree i got out my trusty fandex bird guide and there it was a yellow warbler i then got out my equally trusty fandex tree guide and there it was the downy hawthorne tree therefore instead of describing my treasure as a plain ol quotbird sitting in tree plate quot i was able to give it the justice it deserved and described it as a quotlovely yellow warbler nesting atop a downy hawthorne branch plate quot

dance on fire firestarter will make you very angry firestarter will make you very sad it s a clinic in shameful government abuses and a lesson in parental devotion it s a glimpse at the hidden powers of the mind and a treatise on the atrocities committed by men who hunger for power stephen king should not be able to jam so much inside a story and still make it keep a reader up until dawn but stephen king is stephen king and that s what he does in firestarter as with the dead zone he empowers his characters with powerful abilities and then exploits those abilities from every angle a little girl who can ignite infernos through simple thought should not be restrained in a fictional work king does not restrain her young charlie runs amok and as a reader you ll be very glad she did for every house that burns every car that blows up and every evil g man that runs shrieking in flames our little protagonists has amble motivation her father can manipulate another person s thoughts just by thinking real hard a man such as this should not be hidden in a back room to do mere parlor tricks king does not whittle away daddy s powers daddy uses them much as you would if someone locked you up and tried to steal your daughter firestarter is an outright grabber from start to finish king has created some vividly evil entities through the years but few so detestable as the men and women who make up the shop it is a sublevel government agency aimed at mowing down children and families in the ultimate race for world supremacy though he doesn t flout his research skills king no doubt studied up on the cia s experiments with mind control and chemical manipulations as he prepared to write this thriller it s another fantastic tale that may be closer to fact than we want to believe

jurgen in a search for beauty james branch cabell was once the most celebrated figure of american literature he was the favourite author of mark twain and was also praised by other renowned writers including sinclair lewis this book jurgen is among cabell s very finest all his work is fine a book that was long closest to cabell s heart and the one that has the centre of his philosophy the eternal search for beauty his one ideal as the main subject matter jurgen is the place to start and after jurgen i would go back to figures of earth of which happenings actually precede those of jurgen and then on to the silver stallion other great ones by cabell the king was in his counting house smirt smith and smire

guts glory and real history broadsides is perfect for history buffs and for fans of patrick o brians aubrey maturin novels which are set in the same period this is popular history in the barbara tuchman guns of august manner thoroughly researched by an expert who also has a fine sense of narrative drama even the occasional footnotes are enjoyable it s fun to read it s ltthrillinggt to read the age of fighting sail is conventionally put at about years author miller has confined himself to the last quarter or so and with good reason the shorter time span narrows his focus and lets him richly detail on a period that needs detailed coverage after all at this time britain was frequently in conflict with the us then bonaparte then all of the countries that deserted the british cause to join boney or later deserted boney to join britain only details can reduce the confusion here s an example of the value of detail most americans learn in basic history class that washington and cornwallis somehow found themselves at yorktown together where cornwallis just threw in the towel and bangjust like that the american revolution ended miller shows that cornwallis hunting for glory exhausted him army in a series of useless victories fought too far inland for the royal navy to support or supply him and then had to run to yorktown in hope of being evacuated by the british fleet but the french fleet got there first by pure luck and the royal navy s failure to trounce it was a perfect example of hidebound backward tactics that took no risks but gained no glory the over cautious british admiral had protected his career and reputation but as another historian put it quothe had merely lost amnerica quot as the american revolution ends and the french begins miller shows british seapower on the cusp of change at last moving away from risk averse tactics under the urging of a generation of more daring commanders pellew howe collingwood jervis and the immortal incomparable nelson many of their battles were as exciting in fact as they are in the movies there s excellent material on the faltering beginnings of the american navy too which for example thomas jefferson was mightily in favor of until as president he decided he didn t want to pay for it the cast of characters is superb the british fighters mentioned above and scheming boney of course but also the usual crew of addlepates and blockheads in the admiralty captain bligh not the sadist he s been painted as hilariously inept french and spanish admirals even worse british generals except for the miraculous arthur wellesley later the duke of wellington and the odd cross grained collection of self interested citizen patriots of the american revolution nathan is especially good at distinguishing between naval combat and seapower with brisk incisive strokes he shows how all those blockades and sinking ships affected alliances and strategy o brian fans will especially appreciate this because it will enable them to re read the entire aubrey maturin series with greater grasp of the period and the issues bill marsan

a treasure bag of wonderful japanese tales for my money everything that royall tyler touches turns to gold and that is as true of quotjapanese tales quot as it is of his more recent translation of quotthe tale of genji quot in quotjapanese tales quot he has assembled and artfully translated stories published between the ninth and fourteenth centuries in japan stories that are often difficult if not impossible to find elsewhere in english for the most part these are not the extended stories that we tend to call fairy tales in the west and the book is not designed to provide reading material for children what it does provide is a very solid sampling of the types of tales the early japanese used to provide moral guidance explain how things came to be and record historical moments and if that were not enough tyler s outstanding introduction pages in length provides a lucid understanding of life in heian period japan and beliefs about everything from serpents and mountains to deities and demons this is simply a book you cannot afford to miss if your interests in japan are those of either an enthusiastic amateur or a focused scholar 
as a year old man i liked it i listened to the audiobook i usually become annoyed with books with skip to back story alot it didn t bother me much here although i understand the comparison i detested inkheart inkspell as being very very boring and drawn out and depressing so i am probably am in the minority the mysteries of this book are more thoughtful and the story moves along sometimes i wasn t sure if the mysteries or confusions were caused by confusion on my part or the author s still it is this very confusion which makes it interesting to me i had to fill in the gaps a bit and i got to imagine what it all meant it had a resonance for me

great book for getting useful employee ideas ideas are free how the idea revolution is liberating people and transforming organizations by robinson and schroeder is written for entrepreneurs and managers who want to encourage their employees to contribute ideas and insight to increase profitability and organizational efficiency the authors argue that managing employee ideas is a crucial area for companies in today s rapidly changing business world companies which utilize employee ideas gain competitive advantages in efficiency product development understanding customers and improving the company s culture yet today when asked many company managers say they take a family approach and use an informal method of managing employee ideas robinson and schroeder write tellingly however these same managers are not as casual about other things take travel expenses for example would these managers leave a big barrel of cash in the corner and tell employees who are travelling to take whatever they need spend it wisely and put back whatever they don t use no need for receipts or a report because they just get in the way and were just one big happy family no organization manages its money this way because it would soon be out of business it has to ensure that what is supposed to be happening is actually happening and of course managers who claim in the absence of any measurement or control mechanism that large numbers of ideas in their organizations are naturally flowing to welcoming supervisors and being quickly implemented are deluding themselves robinson and schroeder tell us that many companies which want to encourage employee ideas do so badly often discouraging employee idea contribution but creating employee resentment internal company sabotage and manager resentment to the ideas robinson and schroeder explain why traditional reward schemes for idea contribution often fail but do succeed in generating animosity for example we learn that an employee of a large wireless company discovered an annual million billing error due to a significant number of international phone calls that the company failed to record properly the employee dutifully placed his idea for a simple fix in the company suggestion box robinson and schroeder write under the rules of the company s idea system once the idea was implemented the suggester would be owed percent of the first year s revenue from it in this case some million at the time we visited the company top management had been evaluating the idea for several years the idea system manager was furious the ceo would rather continue losing million per year he told us than risk the embarrassment that might ensue from having to pay such a large reward the sheer size of the oversight would make any manager reluctant to admit that it had happened on his or her watch a million reward would have come to the attention of his board think of the negative publicity not only had management failed to bill customers to the tune of million per year but it had to pay millions more to discover its blunder it is easy to see why the ceo wanted the idea buried robinson and schroeder argue that employees want to see their ideas used so that traditional reward schemes for idea generation aren t even necessary but the authors argue that an effective idea system must have several key components such as quickness in evaluating ideas and providing feedback further the best success is achieved when the company is able to focus employee ideas in key areas robinson and schroeder write when managers learn how to aim ideas at specific targets they gain a powerful weapon when ideas are needed on a specific topic the most straightforward thing to do is to ask for them the challenge is to identify the right issue and to define it in a way that is meaningful to employees perhaps surprisingly robinson and schroeder argue that going after small ideas is often the most productive because not only are small ideas the best source of big ideas but small ideas are often situation specific which means they often remain proprietary to the company adopting them and adopting even small changes can lead to new understanding to help the business or can lead to unanticipated positive results for example ideas are free tells us about a machinist who noticed that it took considerable time to change the oil barrels which were used to hold cooling oil which was sprayed on parts as they were machined he suggested installing an overhead system of pipes to pipe in the oil from a large tank after adopting the change the company noticed several results first the forklift operator whose job was to replace the barrels of oil could be redeployed to a more profitable job second floor space was freed up third oil could now be purchased in bulk reducing its cost fourth machine downtime was reduced fifth oil spills were reduced and because each oil spill required certain governmental paperwork the cost in processing this paperwork was greatly reduced sixth the new hoses that sprayed the oil had gauges showing how much oil was consumed despite recycling much of the cooling oil they noticed that considerable oil was still lost they discovered that the loss was due to the oil that remained on the metal shavings spewed away as the parts were machined after a bit of engineering the company also found a way to recycle more of this oil further reducing its oil costs to help employees become better at generating ideas robinson and schroeder suggest adopting idea activators such as employee job rotation adopting the customer s perspective ongoing learning and reading groups i highly recommend ideas are free how the idea revolution is liberating people and transforming organizations to all managers and entrepreneurs who wish to tap into the benefits of employee ideas peter hupalo author of thinking like an entrepreneur 
part two highly improbable this highly improbable sequel to the hithiker s guide to the galaxy is as enjoyable or maybe even more so than the first installment like the first book there are numerous characters that make the book hilarious hatblack desiato the rock star of the group disaster area whose music is so loud it must be observed from distant planets the mutant star goat the menacing creature who swallows planets the ruler of the universe like most of the book he is not what would be expected the talking meat because it is better to eat an animal that wants to be eaten than an animal that doesn t right the golgafrinchamians the hairdressers and telephone cleaners also our ancestors the concept of time travel is introduced in this story and the author makes a humorous grammatical observation about time travel time tenses are confusing what tense would you use in english if you were describing something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time jumping forward two days in order to avoid it tricky as a missionary struggling with the complex grammar of a foreign language i found this chapter regarding grammar hilarious enjoy the book and don t hurt yourself laughing 
real good book this book is very insightful and very well documented you can tell the author is very pro kennedy but it is still interesting to hear the story from someone on their side very easy to read also 
surprisingly modern politics greed and darkness in his apt introduction martin seymour smith opines that nostromo is the best latin american novel written in the english language while these sorts of contentions are always difficult to evaluate in terms of accuracy it would be safe to say that if one were to make such a ranking then nostromo would have to be considered for a reader who has followed the history of european commerce and presence in latin america it will be surprising to hear that nostromo was written in the complexity of the situation in costaguana will be all too familiar as will the loveliness and resources of that troubled region the characters in nostromo cling to the hope of rescue from the more developed countries at the same time it is increasingly apparent that the values from the old world have no real place in the new the frustration and hopelessness of ever sucessfully affecting change put paid to even the best motivations there is a bitterness here that feels very modern denying any golden age of european contact nostromo is moving and complex the mix of personal and global stories blend mostly seamlessly it realizes the promise in less developed conrad novels victory for example and is the fullest of all conrad reading experiences it is not however a hopeful book and any optimism it exhibits is well guarded readers are advised to spend some patience allowing conrad to build the picture of costaguana in the intial part of the book the patience will pay off later on and there will be more than enough character driven action later to compensate for the history lesson in addition to the introduction by seymour smith the penguin edition comes with explanatory notes and a handy glossary of terms 
the right book one thing i like about the books gary keller puts together is he goes right to the horse s mouth and asks those who are making it big investing in real estate what are you doing that works so well for you he sees a pattern they all have and then puts a system down in book form that anyone can follow for the beginner there are enough details to give you a good idea what to do beginning to end create a plan and pursue it stay focused for the advanced you get reaffirmation that what you are doing is right and a few new angles to try you ll find a gem here and there that will strengthen your systems and procedures most of all you get the notion to think big i mean really big a million dollars a year in cash flow big ! big enough so you can share your masses of wealth with the masses make a difference in the world and never miss the money specifics are somewhat lacking but don t sweat that part there is no right or wrong investment only a right or wrong way of handling it 
powerful and troubling an important book history is often written on the grand stage the huge battles or landmark laws are recorded the feelings of the children whose parents are caught up in the monumental events are rarely recorded in let me go helga schneider has given us just such an account her mother was a seemingly unapologetic nazi who abandoned her family to serve hitler helga is now going to visit her dying mother who is possibly suffering from dementia helga just needs to know and engages in incredibly difficult conversations with her mother is her mother still rational is she telling the truth why would she do the brutal things that she herself describes including tortures and nonchalantly sending another woman who offended her to be enslaved in a brothel this is compelling reading and an underappreciated way of knowing history the only comment i have and it is not directed at schneider but at society in general we are always surprised when it is a woman who in engages in such terrifying acts as it violates the stereotype of female behavior we would probably not be as surprised if this book were written in terms of going to see her aged father

drew me in long having toyed with the idea of retiring in the south of france my interest was piqued when friends told me about this book they were ready to lend me their copy but seeing that this was a topic close to heart i e the buying of a house in southern europe i decided to go out and buy it admittedly the narrative started off slowly for me however once mayes started to recount the tale of actively looking for a house and ultimately finding one i was hooked since i am a bit of food lover the recipes were of interest as well in all i read the book in two sittings it s that interesting once you get going if i could proffer some criticism i would point out that the book has little insight for those hoping to find a true cultural observation the author and her boyfriend deal with the locals in various capacities from notary to carpenter but they befriend too few to really get at the heart of the real tuscans of course given that friendships in europe develop at glacier speeds this is normal nonetheless my hope is that all the years spent in italy mayes will be able to address this lacuna in her next book the one i picked up today all in all under the tuscan sun is an eloquent worth while story about a fascinating part of the world

great book great advice after being at my wits end trying to figure out just what was going on in the head of my scaredy dog i picked up brown s book on page after page she described behaviors i was seeing develop and offered solutions to those behaviors fortunately for me my dog is not as scared as the ones she describes were that said many of the techniques she outlines have been saving graces for me most importantly i now use a crate in the car when i drive with my dog no more barking wildly at buses motorcycles other dogs and trolleys ! no more trying to clamber out the window after those offensive pieces of machinery ! i have no more fear about how my dog is going to act in the car and she has a lot more security while being in the car there are many other strategies i will consider using with my scaredy dog if your dog is the kind of dog who reacts unpredictably in a wide variety of situations and you want to keep your dog other dogs and other people safe around your dog this book provides a strong and solid base from which to begin your work highly recommended

great book for introverts i bought this book after a lifetime of feeling different from everyone because i would rather spend time alone than in social situations no i didn t have social anxiety it s just given a choice a walk in the woods alone is much more appealing to me than any party i m not shy strange or a socialphob i m an intovert as are of the world population still we are one of the most misunderstood parts of society and very few books exist to understand introversion this is one of them and after purchasing it i realized that it was worth the purchase price just from the information in the introduction to hear there are other people who feel the same way i do about things who make excuses not to attend gatherings because to tell the truth and say you would rather stay home gets shocked pitying reactions we re not abnormal we are normal introverts the only reason this book did not get five stars from me is because she seems to overdo her points in places and harp on things over and over but it s still a good book and well worth the price 
pretty good this was a good read koontz s vesion of the contiunation of the frankenstein classic book is not due out till the end of that is a disapointment he has the odd series as well that he is writing this guy those not have writers bloc

fabulously entertaining romantic comedy this is one of the most entertaining books i ve ever read especially if like me you are a new york theatre fan it starts off a little clumsily but once it catches some momentum it hurtles forward with sharply drawn scenes that will often make you laugh out loud sometimes just from the sheer cleverness of the writing there s more than a little wisdom in bram s story about love and relationships in contemporary new york a very satisfying tale of people finding their ways to each other highly recommended and the ian mckellen character is terrifically funny 
fantastic this was a very good book i just kept turning the pages this is the first i have read by this author and i was very impressed after about the first pages it really takes off i am glad a friend loaned it to me to bad it tok me over a year before i opened it

my jesus how sad to see so many people accusing jesus of witchcraft of course this is not unexpected the scribes and pharisees did that kind of thing they accused him of casting out demons by the prince of demons i suppose because those involved in witchcraft were known to practice casting out demons then it followed in their eyes that jesus must be doing the same thing i find nothing in the book that is not biblical in its meaning i actually cannot find the word levitation mentioned in the bible yes i know it is associated with witches but it also is applied in medicine in the treatment of burns where people are supported on a cushion of air to aid quicker healing satan mimics the miracles and ministry of jesus it is not the other way round satan does them for his own ends jesus does them as the son of god satan does them for evil and jesus for good so i would not want to many of you risking speaking out the way you are against the jesus that the scriptures really reveal satanists pray so should we satanists offer human sacrifice jesus offered himself as a human sacrifice as the son of god jesus walked on the water in so doing he defied the rules of science just as is depicted in levitation re witches he did an even greater things he arose from the dead leaving the grave clothes exactly as they were when they were bound around him after that he ascended to heaven having first descended into hell hell has many meanings and is depicted with different names essentially hell is used to relate to all the things associated around it in our modern day english we need to communicate in the language of the people to get the message over satanists seek to raise the dead and mimic jesus i have no problems seeing my jesus the one the bible declares as doing the things that are depicted in the book re choo thomas he is greater than satan and does greater things than he can do he does them out of love not out of hate like satan does i do not see choo presenting works unto salvation i see that we are saved unto good works and by our deeds we will be judged as to what rewards we recieve for only those works that come through the test of fire will remain the rest will be burnt up so if we are not producing pure works then there will be nothing left but the the grace of god praise god for that and yes we will have lowly positions somehow we seem to forget that jesus said you call me lord and master and asked why we do not do what he asks us to do we are being called into obedience to christ to obey him too many of us are more interested in doing what we want to do and then in troubled times asking jesus to help us the book clearly depicts the difference between those that are obedient and those that or not many of you felt unclean or afraid when you read the book your proper response was repentance and faith towards god you then would have been doubly blessed rather than depending on some past commitment you made wake up people

invisible yes but not unreachable phillip yancey has become one of my favourite authors this is because he is not afraid to ask tough questions does not always provide answers and is very open about his own upbringing freely sharing his own struggles and deficiencies in this book he searches far and wide and suggests many things i had not considered before god as artist god as lover and many more pictures that my own conservative upbringing never allowed well done mr yancey i look forward to my next read a followup to this book and i heartily recommed any of phillip s books yes 
this book will blow your mind i read this book quite awhile ago or was it just tomorrow i am fascinated by all things that have to deal with time the nature of reality and god i guess i could have worse hobbies but things are not always what they seem to be in truth things are always much much more than what they appear to be i had an experience once where all of the sudden i was somewhere in my past it wasn t like a memory i was actually there and yet i was simultaneously conscious that i was also somewhere else in time and then i realized if i could be in the past as well as the present i wondered if i could also move into the future and lo and behold i was there and then before i knew it i was back in what i knew to be my present reality we cling to our beliefs of what we feel to be true of certain things and when those beliefs are threatened we re threatened because we think we ve been mislead or lied to when all that really took place is that we were given some incomplete information and that s okay no need to get our knickers in a bunch just go forth in this new now moment the only time there really is and accept embrace and embody the truth that all things including your little life is much bigger than you had previously realized i remember that you already bought this book next week and you told me three weeks ago you really really liked all things are taking place in the now all the possibilities of time and space converge upon a single point this is a great book and a great find read it and blow your linear mind right out of the waters of pragmatism 
warm and fuzzy i really enjoyed this book ! as an iranian i loved getting a behind the scenes look at an italian family and was struck by the universality of the experiences this book however should come with a warning the description of foods leaves the reader hankering for an italian meal ! thank you gina for sharing your family and childhood with the rest of us 
one of the most thought provoking i ve read yet while browsing through the local bookstore one cannot help but to be bombarded with at least different published versions of this wonderous story the divine comedy by dante aligheri sets in motion the journey of a pilgrim through the nine layers of hell accompanying him is his guide none other then the famous poet virgil while he accends down into the depths each layer has a character with a story to be told to be honest i had flipped through this book before and found in daunting set up in canto form the book is split in chapers i was pleasently surprised to see that i had been very wrong this book has opened up new ideas to me and made me think of religion and the philosophy of life in a way i never thought of before the inferno is a very descriptive story that will not leave you unsatisfied 
big girl knits the text offers very helpful information has great advise to big girls and compensates for the designs i did not find the majority of the designs flattering or appropriate for big girls 
recipes are not quite right i have an older edition of this book that was given to me so maybe it s not the same with the new edition but the times for the recipes are so far off almost every recipe i have tried from this book other than bread maker recipes or just the basic ideas for food i have had to cook at least twice as long as it says my babies have all enjoyed the teething biscuits and everything we ve made out of the book as far as the recipes not being healthy enough i think we all know that making food at home is healthier than processed prepackaged food and i didn t find the recipes to be truly unhealthy in my edition of the book she warns off feeding uncooked honey to babies under year and does suggest hot dogs sparingly it s not for people who want to go completely whole foods but for your average household i think it s a pretty realistic approach to feeding your child it would get stars if the recipes were actually the proper cooking time 
bountiful pots this book is a manual for vegetable gardening from containers smith an experienced vegetable gardener noted that many would be gardeners lack access to garden plots or find tending such plots difficult because of physical challenges gardening in containers would make it possible for these people to grow some of their own food but yields have been notoriously low for container grown vegetables smith and his wife silvia embarked on a project several years ago to see if they could develop improved growing methods that would produce produce of acceptable quality and quantity in containers what they found through their experimentation is that virtually all garden vegetables can be grown very successfully in containers and that some actually do better in containers than in traditional earth gardens in this book they describe in detail how to grow vegetables and herbs in containers noting which crops and varieties are the best choices for container growing the book is a joy to browse through with its numerous high quality color photographs many of which were taken by silvia smith smith notes that the key to good vegetable yields is an ample and continuous supply of water in traditional pots this is hard to achieve since the pots must be checked and watered several times a day during peak seasons a further problem is that many of the nutrients are washed out of the soil each time the pot is watered this led smith to the new generation of selfwatering pots which consist of a container for holding soil and roots suspended over a large water reservoir with a significant air gap in between as well as a means for water to be wicked into the soil from the reservoir smith found that when vegetables are grown in such self watering pots they can go for days or even a week without watering yet the soil never goes dry nor loses nutrients through watering he found that many garden vegetables thrive in such pots although he notes that a few herbs do better in traditional pots in addition to describing types of pots for bountiful vegetable gardening smith provides very useful information about soil mixtures to use in the pots he enumerates garden pests that may be encountered and ways to overcome them throughout the book he stresses organic methods and sustainable garden practices a very useful section of the book is the alphabetical guide to garden vegetables in which he takes up each common garden vegetable in turn and provides specific tips for growing the vegetable in a container noting any varieties that are better for container growing than others i first heard about smith s container garden efforts when i saw his container grown artichoke with a giant blue judges choice ribbon at the tunbridge fair that incredible display got me intrigued with the idea of trying to grow some vegetables in pots myself as smith notes in the book certain heat loving vegetables such as eggplants and artichokes are practically impossible to bring to maturity here in northern vermont but they can actually produce significant yields when grown in self watering containers although i do most of my gardening in a large earth garden i m looking forward to using smith s methods to grow eggplants in containers this summer with some luck i may finally be able to enjoy some homegrown eggplants despite our cool vermont climate

exactly what we need in the arab world one question seemed to have dominated american policy makers and elites in the wake of september how can we make people in the arab world and to a lesser extent europe and the rest of the world understand what america is really about i think there is nowhere better to start than de tocquevilles democracy in america a frenchman and a social observer he offers an analysis of the phenomenon that is america that is way different than what we arabs are exposed to my family mostly gets its info about america from hollywood mcdonald gap and arabic media which has good reasons to fret about american interventionism in our part of the world the reactionary and ad hoc measures that the american policy makers are taking today like establishing the scandalous and disenfranchised al hurra satellite arabic tv station only undermine and insult the intelligence of arabs who see right through such gambits we need a thorough eloquent compassionate and outreaching approach like that of de tocqueville to convince us that after all america is a force for good in the world ideally our own arab de tocqueville should emerge though i m not very optimistic today america to arabs is not just a curiosity like it used to be to the french in the th century it s something much worse than that this is why action has to be taken

classic olga i have the version and it s been back and forth to italy with me numerous times it s the clearest most brief summary i have seen the short page small format book is a natural for those who like to pack light take it on the plane and refresh your memory on major verbs key tenses agreement patterns whatever you need to review would work equally well as a reference of essential grammar for beginners working with other learning materials

do yourself a favor and read this book i was hooked upon reading the opening paragraph when i walk into a bookstore any bookstore first thing in the morning i m flooded with a sense of hushed excitement books of facts and truths books newly written and those first read centuries before books of great relevance and of absolute banality standing in the middle of this confluence i can t help but feel the possibility of the universe unfolding a little once upon a time he goes on to share not only his love of books his personal history with books we find out the one that transformed him from a person who read because it was required into one of us a book addict but also the actual history of books clay tablets to papyrus to paper printing booksellers over the centuries in a fascinating manner and he makes one of the greatest book addict statements ever i am promiscuous when it comes to bookstores if that statement is true for you you should read this book 
thought provoking i ve been one to dabble in quantum physics on and off in the theoretical field for a good part of my life toben and wolf s book made it a lot of fun when i was first starting out as i expand my knowledge of the relationships of this universe i still come back to this work if you happen to get your hands on a copy guard it jealously ! i m in search of a copy for my adopted niece and don t intend to lose mine 
the only buffett book you ll ever need usually biography of a person like buffett would be dull and slow but not this one although there are no usual warren buffett way tips on stock picking the book uncovers various aspects of buffett s life which has great implications on how buffett grew into what he is today two thumbs up ! another great great book by roger lowenstein did i mention it s the only buffett book you ll ever need 
fascinating but not profound i found this book to be highly readable and to stand as an important example of immigrant and post immigrant fiction the chinese american experience is different from the jewish american experience or the irish american experience but they also have a great deal in common tan successfully portrays the younger generation s desire to conform to american ideals and the older generation s often stubborn resistance to acculturation somewhere in between lies a happy medium that is often not attained until a third or fourth generation my only gripe is not with the book itself but with the notion that this is a profound work of literature that needs to be taught in high school or even college classes i see it as excellent popular fiction which is a major achievement but not as a book for the ages 
as for accomodation guides hi all i note that people have mentioned this guide is short on accomodation listings the new zealand automobile association aa and a company called jasons both provide very detailed accomodation guides which you can pick up in nz when you arrive i think both of these are actually free too hopefully useful information from a resident kiwi enjoy your travels 
when you want to do something different i ve read the reviews for this book and can help but notice they are all stars or stars clearly there is a disconnect i read this book a few months before i packed up my life and hit the road to travel for a year i thought up until this point in my life my wildest travels had been traveling around europe with my parents a package trip to tahiti and many drunken nights in mexico not the seasoned independent traveler this book motivated me and gave me a philosophy that just felt right for me when i finished reading this i was super excited to hit the road something that had been waning as the date approached well i left and my one year trip kept on getting extended almost five years and eighty countries later i finally arrived home again and i still am a huge fan of this book i carried the last chapter of the book the ultra light guidebook with me the entire time i still have the mutilated original first edition sitting proudly on my book shelf just last week i had to wrestle with my wife over my need to keep it i am eagerly waiting for the third edition when i will gladly re read the world awaits perhaps from the position of experience i will be disappointed but i don t think so in short if you have not traveled much or have not traveled much in the developing world and think that you might someday want to go on a trip this book is for you if you have no desire in traveling and don t understand why anyone would want to put on a backpack and see what is out there this book is also for you if you have hitch hiked through west africa gone to an airport to get on the next plane going someplace interesting or keep your travel immunizations and passport up to date just in case this book might not be for you you ve probably already developed your own philosophy and probably do not need to be encouraged to leave your house but this book might still be a pleasant reminder that there are kindred souls out there peace and safe travels 
a new review dotting the is i made an earlier jokingly one liner that does not justice to the book or to lenin what i think should looked for in this book is exactly the following that lenin was the first marxist ever not to consider the development of class consciousness a kind of spontaneous outgrowth of the concrete existence of a working class therefore the necessity for politics specially party politics to take precedence in marxist analysis over pure economic analysis this jump in esentials was made by lenin very early in life as his development of capitalism in russia written in his late twenties is still a prime piece of economicistic marxism what is to be done is already a prime owrk of a new politics first approach one may think whatever one wants of the solutions found by lenin abaove all the party of professional revolutionists disciplined and centralized but one may not deny him the fact that it was him who first made a new kind of marxist approach to issues that is still very much with us 
another great book on miles not many artists are that interesting where you want too read any book you see on them but miles davis was not just any other cat the man changed the way music was heard had a style in hsi playing leading his band that made him one of the cornerstones this book takes on the man mythsmusictimesraps it all together as on id say the book is very fair overall in speaking on him as a artist a human being when you read one book on miles you will want more just like it because that is the vibe miles has on you once you are hooked on his genius 
a book which raises many questions what more can be said which already hasn t of this extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man of courage with reviews i will not make this an overly elaborate review as the book simply does not require it elie wiesel s story is one of one man s courage will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost friends family belongings even basic human dignity what struck me more than anything else from his personal story was the retelling of the hanging of the three men well two men and one boy while he was in one of the concentration camps millions perished but the way the boy who suffered during the hanging stayed with me his story is the story of millions who perished and who never got to tell their tale and one of the few books i would call a must read different instances in the book i am quite sure will strike readers differently one of the things which struck me and stayed with me was how he kept on looking for god even amidst the enormity man sometimes will carry out on his fellow man what also struck me was the woman on the train who was saw the flames at the camps even before they arrived and the times he scolded and questioned himself and his ethics for even thinking selfish thoughts even though he was dying i still think would i could i do the same if i was in his terrible position this book shows the worst of mankind and sadly this terrible event known as the holocaust is not entirely unique in man s history since the freeing of elie wiesel we have witnessed rwanda firsthand in the s and have been told by world authorities that this will never happen again yet in modern day sudan and north korea and tibet we see much of the same the world turning its back on millions of people there may not be furnaces involved but the crime of complicity through inaction is little different than a world which allowed human beings to be fed into furnaces i guess the final question i come away asking from his book is will mankind ever learn 
about time i ve read the the magic mountain or going by its original name der zauberberg at least three times yet there are many parts in it that have still remained inaccessible to me it is just too big a tome perhaps it has to do with the fact that thomas mann tried here to tackle three major areas the nature of time the philosophy of the enlightenment versus dogmatic faith in religious and political doctrines and of course the big one love each of these themes would have easily deserved a novel in itself but mann never seems to have shrunk from a literary challenge in fact similar to one of the book s protagonists ludovico settembrini mann seems always ready to show off his vast knowledge of philosophy natural sciences and historical events to me the only shortcoming of this work but it s also evident that mann perceived those issues as being of most importance in a world bent on crossing swords at least over some of these issues in a man made violent cataclysm known as world war i the main idea i ve tucked away from this book concerns the ever changing nature and concept of time we know that our being is ephemeral to paraphrase one of the most entertaining characters hofrat behrens second only to the elephantine yet tragic character of mynheer peeperkorn we come from darkness and we go into darkness and there s the time between our coming and going that somehow demands to be filled out with elegance and a good dose of occasional irony mann shows how we as humans strive or occasionally not strive and or struggle to do this letting the characters develop in this setting at literally the top of the world hans castorp whose life at berghof we mainly observe seems to be a creature of comfort enjoying the many amenities and the ordered life in this institution but with time he also aspires to something higher he seeks out settembrini s company to learn he also begins to study anatomy having been cued by the physical features of one clawdia chauchat takes magnanimous care for the terminal cases among the fellow patients and he faithfully and perhaps fatefully carries a torch for his one true love clawdiahowever with plenty of spare and somewhat empty time at ones disposal time itself becomes a strange beast interminably long in the present when filled with monotony and boredom yet short and unyielding when later recalled from memory what s more time becomes stale a burden even threatening to the mind breeding unrest and the zest for cheap and undignified entertainment this book truly gets to the core of the question as to what defines our humanity whether or how we one day might become less encumbered in this world a world in which conflicts seem sometimes to spring out of the breeding ground of complacency and indolence mann doesn t provide answers to this rather he poses a beautiful question at the very end a question never fully to be answered yet powerful in its allusion seeking to probe the motivations behind our wishes and desires in and from this world

truly insightful on the culture theft wars a change is gonna come is a landmark book in the history of the rock race conversation because werner a white professor of afro american studies has a deeper understanding of the meaning of whiteness than any other rock historian i ve seen it makes a huge difference that werner is both an anti racist and is comfortable in his own skin this comfort allows him to navigate the culture theft accusations and counter accusations without needing to pick sides 
jo mielziner a forgotten genius mary henderson has given us an invaluable insight in the world of jo mielziner so often the names of creative people who ensure that a production quotworksquot are never known or easily forgotten by the viewing audience the set and lighting designs of mielziner for plays and shows like a streetcar named desire death of a salesman south pacific etc were considered brilliant and groundbreaking by the theatre world of his time mielziner also greatly influenced modern stage design the east room stage in the white house and the denver center theatre for example and with his art and creative insight put his unique stamp on the world of modern theatre until this day an overview of his work was long overdue but mary henderson has given us far more than that she has given us jo mielziner the person by providing fascination facts and photographs of jo s private life the many colorful prints of his designs and the enjoyable flow of the text make this book a quotmust have quot and a wonderful gift for anyone interested in the history of th century theatre 
fascinating facts and a really good read it s hard to make something so filled with detailed facts read like a novel but the author has done it the man behind the davinci code is a fascinating journey backstage in the creation of a book and a career i was particularly interested to see inside the publishing world as the author chronicles brown s previous books and their misadventures in the complicated maze of big publishing houses it makes me wonder how many other fine writers are out there waiting to find the right agent editor and publisher to bring them to the world s attention the book is well worth reading for its carefully researched look at the life and work of an author but it s just as compelling for the new dimension it adds to brown s books themselves i will enjoy reading the rest of these even more having read their life histories

old heroes to learn about it has been nearly fifty years since i read this book i had forgotten how much detail butler placed in his research of the lives of the saints although my mind has moved more towards agnosticism it is of great interest for me to read how the church appreciated the lives of some of its past members i am now trying to read of the saints related to that day but alas my schedule is too busy to read the entire selection 
pensbybruno i ordered this book used from a private seller not only was the book in the condition promised but it arrived well before the time when i expected it to 
nice book for the collection i really enjoyed this book as there is a wide range of recipes in varing styles there is also a good description of hop and yeast varieties my only complaint would be that there is sketchy recipe detail for the all grain brewer clearly this book was written with the extract brewer in mind if you are an extract brewer and have your sights set on moving up to a partial mash then this book is a must have 
ok book i think the reviews so far are a little unfair this is really a pretty decent book and for its price it does justice you will be able to get hibernate up and running and get over all the basics with this book alone 
great great book i finally had a chance to really read this whole book and i must say that dede wilson gives very detailed instructions for every recipe and technique that she uses i also tried out some of the recipes and they worked perfect though i did find that she got some of her recipes from quotthe cake bible quot which i also purchased dede wilson s book is a lot more quotattractivequot to read although the designs are in no way as fancy as those in other wedding cake books i love the detailed recipes in this one most cake book authors just want to show you how skillful and how artistic they are but dede wilson really wants to teach you how she does it great book

an outstanding work charles king combines meticulous research with engrossing storytelling to produce a work that is at once intellectually rigorous and readable ambitious in its scope the book traces the history of the black sea from the time of greek trading colonies to the modern regional powers and environmental issues that characterize the sea and the states and peoples that surround it today not limiting itself to a narrow analysis the black sea puts this region into a global perspective and is a valuable read for anyone who is interested in this important part of the world or in the past and future of regional confrontation and cooperation 
anthropocentrism without the hubris mr abel was a humanist that traced his lineage of thought from the english pragmatic humanist f cs schiller to the greek sophist protagoras bce and beyond man is the measure of all things of those that are that they are and of those that are not that they are not protagoras notion that judgements and knowledge are in some way relative to the individual this is a line of agnostic thinkers that put man at the center of the stage they claim no absolute knowledge this last claim socrates did one better by not claiming any knowledge at all socrates is the first of the great humanists in the west and confucius was the first great humanist in the east humanists are proud to be human beings humanists two fundamental tenets are that a man should learn to think for himself and values are uniquely human man is the measure though a little too manthropocentric an approach to our specie s place in the cosmos for my liking abel nevertheless does manage to make me feel good about being human i matter abel s pride does not seem to me to be the false pride of hubris rather he seems a very dignified human being that represents us well i am sorry ladies but you will just have to keep being patient with us men i assure you when abel says man he means mankind men and women with the above said abel s man is the measure is a cordial invitation from a humanist perspective addressed to all human beings in regards to the central problems of philosophy he believes in humanity in our capacity to grow the one and the many are invited to join in the philosophical debates man is the measure is written with a friendly tone and in an elegantly simple manner it is a very thorough outline of philosophical history and you may join in if you like abel is to be congratulated for his ecumenical approach to truth this is a very good place for those with a curious mind to begin or continue their examined life

this truly did save my sanity and our relationship oh boy was i a mess after i found out about the affair i couldn t stop obsessing about it and the anger stayed at the boiling point at our house he was too immersed in shame to reach out and help we wanted to save our relationship but weren t sure how we couldn t manage a civil conversation about anything and i wanted to know every detail i happened across a magazine article about cheating that suggested this book i went straight home ordered it paid for overnight shipping and started reading as soon as it arrived it definitely helped me regain my sanity and helped us talk in a constuctive way so the healing could start he wouldn t read the book but i shared the advice it gave and we both followed it we ve succeeded and strangely enough are probably doing better now than before the affair if you ve been the victim of an affair and wonder when the pain will start to subside i strongly suggest you order this book when it arrives put everything else aside and just read and read and start to regain your sanity good luck to you 
beautiful i have been writing japanese for years and i started with the author s quotlets learn hiragana quot and quotlets learn katakana quot i loved both books especially the hiragana i learned kanji from various sources spent hundreds of dollars on books literally yet none of them were as beautifully written as this one if you want to learn the characters in depth and want to really enjoy writing them yes it is artistic and even fun to do and not just be flabbergasted and frustrated this is the book to start with or even switch over to i might get this book just to improve my handwriting

the best ok for a brief opinion i think this is an absolutely amazing work of fiction that ranks up there with the best of faulkner it ranks up there with the best books ive ever read the prose really makes me reread passages out loud just as previously posted by another reviewer in response to those that deem the work short on plot i just wanted to mention this i could be remembering wrong but i am pretty sure that this is a somewhat autobiographical work that focuses on mccarthy quitting the drink and leaving tennessee for texas so this is not necessarily the same kind of work that the border trilogy or blood meridian are something interesting for me in reading these reviews is that faulkner suffered from the same kind of criticisms especially while he was alive lack of structure and coherent plot i do believe that he is the greatest living american author if not i would love to find the person that beats him 
very very dry but well researched and important the very fact that we in america call the russo german conflict in wwii the eastern front and not the great patriotic war is evidence of our reliance and bias due to the use of primarily german sources for information this has colored to some degree our understanding and knowledge of the most incredible and terrible war front ever fought this work is to be acclaimed for its use of russian sources and data to help balance out our knowledge and allow us to see things from the other side that being said this is a very dry tactical military description of the war missing are the types of stories and anecdotes found in works like barbarossa the work is probably best suited for the avid addict of european wwii or a researcher there are of course some primer text and intro backgrund and decent conclusions at the begining and ends of the chapters but on the whole it reads as a graduate dissertation and tactical timeline the research seems excellent the info remarkable and i would recommend it for the historically factual merits alone this is not to say russian sources should be trusted more than german ones but the author has done a remarkable job sifting through the evidence to bring as non biased a view of the war front as possible 
great book this book is helping me and my son to conquer the obstacles that are set in his way this book is helping him to follow his dreams and have fun playing the sports that he loves it is helping me with my role as a parent of an athletic child i am so glad for the publication of this book i could have used it years ago at times things can get very difficult that is why we need this book to help us through our problems the book should be mandatory for every person involved in the development of an athletic child 
jane austen s best novel in my opinion this is jane austen s greatest book anne elliot is a beautifully written character and austen subtly conveys her strength of mind and depth of emotion with the best of her skills many critics have declared that austen s greatest talent was creating characters that stay in character without getting stagnant and i think this novel is the best showcase for that talent though often not as comical as some of her other works this novel is a beautiful portrait of hopeless lovers and the dialogue always done well by austen is superb what makes this novel stand out in my mind is that though it includes somewhat less of the social satire than her other books though it is of course still present it creates a very honest portrait of family relations and how filial duty can not always inspire love even in the best mannered of individuals for those wondering what exactly makes austen a truly classic author and not just a fun feminine writer i suggest a close reading of persuasion 
more than just a war book the making of a great general a truly engaging book not only in the great behind thescenes detail and insight that it provides on the gulf war but in the way in which it allows the reader to follow the making of the man from his days in grade school to living in iran to his world travels with the u s army to his tours in vietnam you can see how these experiences caused him to be so driven to conduct the gulf war in the right way for the american soldier 
thought provoking account of a diverse field of research douglas hofstadter is best known for his seminal work godel escher bach but not much was known about the work he carried out at the university of indiana this work collects a number of research papers from the s thus offering a glimpse into the continuation of the work that was carried out with the help of the fluid concepts group hofstadter writes well which means that the accounts of the projects that were undertaken are exciting thought provoking and intruiging i m not entirely happy about the theoretical background to some of the work maybe hofstadter tries too deliberately to maintain things at a simple level still if you re at all interested in the state of the art in ai research this is a book you may not want to miss

a beautiful enlightening book for those unfamiliar with isalm abou el fadl cracks open the tradition you can see islamic reasoning at work as he compares sources uses the ancient writers and parses out conclusions read especially his deconstruction of alleged authorizations for violence against women in islam and his defense of the tradition of women scholars you can also feel his anguish at how much of islam has turned its back on reason and the core belief that god commands the just and beautiful in favor of a narrow minded fundamentalism christians struggling to defend against christian fundamentalism will find an ally here and if you love books you will rejoice in his loving invocation of the conference of books the collected wisdom of centuries that swirl around him each night as he studies my only complaint is that i would wish to have had more of this book more islamic analysis of issues abou el fadl has been accused of being a sympathizer of terrorists by pipes reading this book will show the absurdity of that claim and how his opposition of extremism is woven into his entire world view

a view into the history of reason this book was wonderful it shouldn t be read as a history but more as a philosophy even there it is a bit short of the greats why then do i call it wonderful it is a view into the past intelligentsia his history is antiquated from a modern perspective some of it is wrong however it is great to see the history of views about history and the philosophy of them i am not a pursuer of the p c and understand that the context of civilization at his time is the molder of his views old books such as this are windows into time and are treasures to be cherished as far as his philosophy i intend to read more of his work in the future to get a better perspective but i found it interesting i am on board with hegel in that we should pursue our ideal of the greek golden era to maintain a lofty goal for civilization which can be summed up by thucydides in his description of athenian life quotwe love the beautiful but without ostentation or extravagance we philosophize without being seduced thereby into effeminacy and inactivity for when men give themselves up to thought they get further and further from the practical from activity for the public for the common weal we are bold and daring but this courageous energy in action does not prevent us from giving ourselves an account of what we undertake we have a clear consciousness respecting it among other nations on the contrary martial daring has its basis in deficiency of culture we know best how to distinguish between the agreeable and the irksome notwithstanding which we do not shrink from perils quot 
far superior to any legendary pirates book pay attention to the subtitle pirate tactics and techniques little writes a wonderful book about pirates here he avoids sinking into the typical history of this that and the other pirate sort of cliche that other authors have followed how many different times can you recount the exploits of edward teach and henry morgan anyway rather his book is a study of how the pirates conducted their business there are chapters on how they recruited how they acquired their ships and sailed on what they would have been interested in retrieving from their prey no buried treasure or chests of aztec gold here what weapons they used and how they were used ship types and descriptions sailing and chasing techniques flags routines ashore etc this is much more informative and interesting than the actual biographical books little is certainly fully qualified to write this book as he spent years on the teams although he went as an officer which is something like joining the dark side and afterwards was an analyst for nsw strategy and tactics group he did a ton of research demonstrated by his pages of footnotes and pages of references and presents the subject matter in straightfoward and easily understood manner the one thing that somewhat disappoints me is the total lack of any information on pirates in areas besides the caribbean a simple addition of caribbean somewhere in the title would have been nice he completely skips over the notorious barbary corsairs who were less well known for their seamanship but better known for their bloody boarding actions or the pirate lords of the far east such as ching yih who nearly ruled a nation for a little more information on these check out angus konstam s history of pirates i heartily recommend this book to anybody who is interested in actual pirate practices in the caribbean

a very thought provoking book this is an excellent book that will really make you rethink the history you ve been taught as another reviewer put it half the population was left out of history ! this book gives an account of the many roles puritan women played during this time and the immense impact they had on history i enjoyed reading about the impact of sexuality and reproduction imagine your entire life being filled with getting pregnant giving birth and lactating and then starting the cycle all over again it just goes to show that women who aren t allowed control over their bodies aren t allowed any control in society we can tie this to our own culture and the struggle for birth control and abortion rights anyways a great read and i shall make my future sons and daughters read it so they know that women have a strong important place in history

a stunning reality although many people might question whether everything in this novel is true or not it states on the front that it is a memoir therefore that is how i thought of it while reading as far as i am concerned everything but the names and some situations to protect individuals is the truth and since i have not been to tehran i would not know any different i found this book captivating in most every way from the detailed descriptions of the girls in the book club to the references to other novels such as the great gatsby although i have not read all of the books nafisi referenced in her memoir i still understood her story and appreciated her sharing the private or public moments with her readers i was shocked when i read about some of the laws that women and men must obide by in iran and this book sparked my interest regarding the stunning ways of the country enough from the very beginning to encourage me to look even further into the culture being a secondary education english major i would suggest this book to anyone from the age of on with hopes that he or she would read it appreciate it and try to gain some knowledge on a very different culture than our own while recognizing the everyday freedoms we take for granted on a daily basis 
rationality could not explain the essence of religion in this book schleiermacher wanted to revitalize the idea that human feeling is absolutely dependent on god one who reads history in his era will find that something had disappeared from religious life because of subjective rationalism i assume this is exactly the reason for romantic movement in the view of friedrich schleiermacher romanticism was a movement of the rediscovery of feeling as the essence of religion feeling is the key idea of how someone internalizes the values morality and even the idea of god within himself for schleiermacher science and knowledge which is based on rationality could not explain the essence of religion religion has nothing to do with the knowledge of nature the knowledge of god on the contrary could not be understood in the frame of cause and effect religion always related to the infinite thing and in order to understand it one must use immediate feeling schleiermacher said to seek and to find this infinite and eternal factor in all that lives and moves and to know life itself only in immediate feeling that is religion schleiermacher denied science because it could not bring out the contemplation of the infinite science or knowledge of religion is not religion itself and it obviously cannot be possibly on the same level with feeling or the contemplation of religion it is very clear in his book that schleiermacher wanted to put science and morality underneath religion one could not understand any thing without religion as a result morality and all ethical systems have no meaning without religion briefly it is impossible for a person to be moral or scientific without religion after subjugating science morality and even art schleiermacher redefined religion and its relation to the universe he defined religion based on human feeling even though it doesn t mean subjectivism we feel all particular action our being and life only through the consciousness of god the consciousness of god is a kind of external circumstance that makes all people have the same feeling thousands of people could feel the same religiosity aroused in the same manner because of that external circumstance i found a unique idea in this book when he said every particular religious organization has limited horizons none therefore is able to embrace all nor accordingly is any able to believe that nothing is to be seen beyond its own horizons from this argument schleiermacher wanted to convince readers that difference of feeling is inevitable everyone then must be ready to see that there may be different views and experiences again this can happen because the quality of feeling may be different schleiermacher stated religion however doesn t for a moment desire to encapsulate all who have faith and feeling within a single faith or feeling its task is to develop sensitivity for the eternal unity of life s originating source among people whose capacity for religious experience is still immature therefore within the condition of immature one must be ready to have openness each person must be open to the fact that perceptions and feelings belong to other forms of religion for which he may well lack any sensitivity at all from this point schleiermacher imagined a clear conception of inter subjectivity in religion he said this is precisely the real source of the art and love we are looking for in relation to morality schleiermacher made a distinct separation between religion and conduct he used an example one who acts badly may have no morality at all but one who has morality may not be pious as well so the relation between religion and morality is not implicative religion in itself doesn t urge people to action at all one can act well or badly depending on one s feelings therefore conduct as a whole should be regarded as a reaction of feeling if someone puts a good character into his feeling his conduct will be good as well the more we can attribute the character of piety to a feeling the more strongly it tends to retreat within it

fascinating albeit incomplete reorient is one the most important works of the last decade in that it not only challenges a dominant perspective in western social science but it also refutes author s and his colleagues earlier arguments andre gunder frank lays down two central arguments in reorient which complement one another the rise of the west did not happen due to any internal factors but was predicated on american silver and asian market asia in general and china in particular was the center of global economy until the th century thus frank aims to destroy the bases of eurocentrism in social sciences frank argues that europe was not an important figure in world economy until the th century asians were more productive and competitive than europeans and asia remained at the center of global economy until the industrial revolution throughout this period european nations constantly had trade deficits with asian nations particularly with china and india an indication of this european trade deficit was that gold and silver were never less than two thirds of total european exports p new world silver was for this reason very important for the europeans it helped them cover their trade deficits with the asians and become a more active player in asian economy thus frank contends that american silver bought europeans a ticket in the asian productive and commercial train which was steaming ahead on an already well established track p one of frank s original arguments regarding the superiority of the chinese economy vis vis the european economy in the th to th century is the different effects on these economies of the influx of new world silver to make his case frank utilizes fisher s famous quantity price equation which maintains that an increase in the amount of money in an economy will result in increases in the prices of goods unless it is matched by an increase in quantity of goods p frank then demonstrates that whereas american silver caused substantial increases in the price of goods in europe it did not have any remarkable inflationary effect on the chinese economy for this to happen chinese production must have increased parallel to the increase in the amount of silver this means that the massive arrival of new american money stimulated production more in asia than in europe pp according to frank this situation attests to higher productivity of chinese economy compared to european economy thus frank refutes the orthodox eurocentric hoarding argument on china which assumed that the chinese used american european silver by and large in non economic and unproductive ways primarily as jewelry asians earned this money first because they were more industrious and more productive to begin with the additional money then generated still more asian demand and production p another historical fact frank uses to demonstrate the superiority of asian economies over european economies is the per capita production in these two economies in the th to th century using the estimates of such prominent historians as braudel and bairoch frank shows that in asians accounted for percent of world population but produced percent of total world output by contrast europe which constituted percent of world population then produced only part of the remaining percent this again means that on average asians must have been significantly more productive than europeans in p as in the fist case franks reasoning is simple but smart and convincing after all these economic comparisons frank concludes that the europeans did not create the world economic system but purchased an existing one with american silver he therefore asserts that the rise of the west must be derived from the prior and contemporaneous development of the rest p prospectsthe principal importance of reorient lies in its demolishing the bases of eurocentrism in theories that explain the rise of west with factors that are internal to europe these theories attributed european economic development to europe s exceptionality in such factors as rationality religion science and geographic location yet frank demonstrates that europe did not have any inherent superiority in the th through th century vis vis asia and asian nations were at least as much rational industrial capitalist and dynamic as the european ones thus there was no european head start or exceptionality that would necessitate the creation of a european hegemony over others it was american silver and asian market that allowed the rise of the west as such frank s arguments change the central question to be dealt with regarding the rise of the west the critical question is no more why it was the west that rose in the th century because it did not but why and how the west rose in the late th and early th century as frank argues the new question is not about a mere difference in time but begs a qualitatively different answer what makes reorient particularly important is that it not only destroys the myth of european exceptionalism but it also uncovers and refutes the eurocentrism in the critics of these theories as well frank argues that such important critics of capitalist world economy as marx braudel and wallerstein could not escape the eurocentrism embedded in the theories they criticized either while marx viewed asian nations as stagnant traditional and inferior wallerstein assigned an insignificant role to asia and the mediterranean in the making of his modern world system p frank views these arguments as mere assumptions and refutes them in two ways first he tries to demonstrate that europe did not have any inherent superiority in the th through th century vis vis asia second frank argues that europe owe its future rise to its borrowing from and integration to a well established asian economy thus frank demonstrates that europe did not create a world system and incorporated more and more of the rest of the world as wallerstein argued but rather integrated itself to the asian market and climbed up on the back of asia pp problemsunfortunately frank s novel theorizing turns out to be at the expense of some conceptual clarity frank s approach to world economy and modes of production renders such important concepts like world system and capitalism ambiguous frank argues that there has always been one world economy system and it had its own structure and dynamic p in frank s view existence of any trade relations between regions of the world create a world system thus frank equates global trade with world system however until the th century trade was highly regionalized and most regions had miniscule contacts with others frank himself notes that europeans role in asian trade before the second half of the th century was insignificant and europe accounted for only one percent of asian nations international trade pp thus if we define world system as a global economic system in which most parts of the world are economically dependent on one another i will have to side with wallerstein who argued that such a system did not exist until the th century the rise and future demise of the world capitalist system in the essential wallerstein p indeed although unintentionally frank also provide support to this point when he notes that europeans were the first to operate in all markets simultaneously or systematically to integrate its activities between all of them p as such there has been only one world system so far and unfortunately it has been a european one a subsequent problem that results from frank s bias towards holistic analysis is his search for single centers in world economy frank argues that the entire world economy was sinocentric until the th century p however i have doubts regarding china s central role in economies of european and middle eastern countries in any period of history throughout the th and th centuries the ottomans and persians were more central to middle eastern economies than were the chinese similarly in the same period the british and the dutch were more central to european economy than the chinese i therefore tend to agree with pomeranz who later stated that the pre world was a polycentric world with no dominant center the great divergence p another shortcoming in frank s book is that he cannot adequately account for the rise of the west in the late th and early th centuries his argument is that asian economies were altogether facing a kondratieff b cycle in the first half of the th century and this allowed europe to finally outdo the asians he therefore asserts that the fall of asia preceded european political and military intervention in asian nations pp the first problem one might have with this argument is that it is impressionistic and allows little room to human agency a more fundamental problem that i have however is that frank s account does not consider the possibility that the asian economic decline in the first half of the th century could have been a temporary problem and asian economies could have easily recovered if it were not for european military intervention indeed frank himself reports that average annual exports from asia by both dutch and british east india companies declined in the decades of s and s but recovered in the s p frank also notes that throughout the th century the balance of trade between britain and china was constantly in china s favor and the british could reverse this situation only through forced opium trade in the th century thus contra frank i believe that asian economic problems in the th century were not insurmountable and the fall of asia was indeed a european creation as such we still do not have a satisfying answer as to why europe outdid the asians by 
the name of the little riddle is revenge the previous book in the series was good but left me with a somewhat bitter taste the reason was the j d robb plunged into the unnatural events genre alla laurell k hamilton since i enjoy the work by both authors i would rather see each one of them write about that which they know best this is why i was pleasantly surprised when in this book i found no references to events outside the boundaries of the futuristic world of finally the year is coming to an end and it is unbelievable how much has happened in just a few months lieutenant eve dallas and roarke meeting and getting married eve remembering crucial events from her childhood mavis seeing her career surging forward and many others the current case involves a serial killer that punishes people that have strayed from the path of the lord the first victim eve finds was not only killed but also tortured savagely to complicate matters further the victim is an old friend of roarke from his time in ireland when eve s husband was involved in certain activities that would not be appreciated by eve in the case of the second victim the killer s intentions become a little clearer since he calls eve and gives her a clue useful for finding the victim before the time of death so now it is personal since the killer wants eve as an opponent and the second victim is also a friend of roarke the relationship between eve and roarke is put to the test since roarke s secrets from his past may aid eve in the investigation but these secrets make him criminally liable is eve more concerned about justice than about keeping her husband things really heat up when sommerset roarke s faithful servant becomes a suspect in the investigation the quality picks up considerably compared to ceremony in death with robb focusing on what she does best and also limiting the passionate scenes to more reasonable levels these had gotten a little bit out of hand in previous works in terms of their frequency and lack of variation in their development now the author creates a much better balance presenting the scenes for those that crave them but not repeating them so much so as to make the book a little boring hopefully the quality of the series will remain at this level until the end 
a pleasant picture book i originally thought this book would serve as a helpful travel guide for adventures on unknown so cal roads but it s really more of a nice coffee table photo book with a bit of history wrapped around the shots great photos though 
context is the king of this comedy the merchant of venice can be described as a tragedy only if one follows the modern definition of tragedy and not the greek the genre of tragedy in which shakespeare wrote required that all of the players or at least all of the main players die at the end  la romeo and juliet julius caesar macbeth and hamlet in fact merchant of venice can only be described as a tragedy if shylock is seen as the main character and not antonio note in the list of players at the beginning of the play only antonio is called a merchant of venice in sum the merchant of venice can only be described as a tragedy if it is completely removed from its historical context shakespeare intended that the actions taken by antonio by shylock by bassanio and even by portia be seen as comically extreme antonio goes to the lengths of seeking help from a man he despises to help a man he loves shylock demands nothing but justice even when the demands of the agreement he made is met and even doubled everywhere in this play is there action taken to the extreme only a refusal to acknowledge the historical context would be blind to the comedy there are stage plays television shows and screenplays aplenty which follow the example set forth in merchant of venice showing how comical people can be when their actions are taken to the extreme if merchant of venice can be view in this context then the comedy shines through as a writer i find it comical that anyone would use merchant of venice to point the finger of racism at shakespeare part of a writer s challenge is to present convincingly views even he or she disagrees with the best writer would try to dismantle and disprove the very beliefs he or she holds dear that shakespeare has often been judged a racist based on his portrayal of shylock serves only as testimony to the continuing success of this play shylock s speech complimented by another reviewer is ample proof that shakespeare s own views are well hid shylock s speech demonstrates magnificently that shakespeare was able to get inside the head of any man or woman in his stories and write the words which that man would speak faithfully render the thoughts which that man would think have that man act as only that man would act and all of it be believable simply put unless you knew beforehand a writer s views on any subject it would be difficult to find the needle of truth in his or her haystack of fiction if that writer has done their job well and in this case shakespeare was damned near flawless it is true that the movie starring al pacino does not present this play as a comedy but that hardly detracts from its excellence it shows in fact that merchant of venice plays well as both a drama and a comedy in our age however given the importance of religious tolerance i ll admit that it is probably best played as a drama as for the pelican series of shakespeare s plays they are an excellent resource for anyone wanting to read and study the bard s work i ve several volumes in this series and hope to eventually own them all each volume contains two identical essays the theatrical world which provides a good understanding of the historical context as well as an idea of just how much we know about shakespeare as an individual and the texts of shakespeare which gives more historical context and also discusses some of the difficulties which editors have experienced in presenting these plays in print to modern audiences there is then an introduction to each play which is best left unread until afterwards if you aren t familiar with the play the footnotes are few but well chosen and do help in understanding words and phrases whose meanings have changed over the centuries 
junie is awesome junie b is definitely for kid s books regardless of the one you pick ! my daughter i love reading these books laughing together ! we haven t actually read this book yet but i am sure this one will be no different we have them all ! 
truly an excellent book when i was a little girl my mother had a bookshelf full of paperback horror novels that she would read mainly stephen kings and and few koontz s i specifically remembered asking her one day whats your favorite one she picked up swan song and said this one for sure that was about years ago and one day recently i was in a used book store and came across it i bought it and honestly thought i would hate it because i have little or no interest in the king s and koontz s that filled her shelf start to finish i was enthralled with this book i thought it was powerful and very well written i was interested in every character that mccammon presented i read the stand a few years ago and it i felt as if it couldn t even compare to this book since finishing swan song i pick up any mccammon i come across mystery walk was great and i just completed book one of the speaks the nightbird series nightbird is different from his past novels perhaps explained by the year break but again mccammon writes so well and makes the readers truly interested in his characters all in all i love mccammon and swan song is one of the finest novels i have read even if it was in the discount horror bin at my local book store

best book on us social classes in the last decade zweig s book is an empirical and analytical tour de force in rigorous fashion he outlines the current class structure of the us in terms of power and control in the workplace he proves the continuing relevance of class analysis in an era when most americans consider themselves middle class and he aptly describes the class war which the quotruling elite quot has been precipitating on the working class the book is clearly written and convincingly argued and should be accessible to a wide audience 
different from other dark tower books but still just as good wolves of the calla in my opinion does the best job of any dark tower book so far of telling a story about people s lives in the world of the dark tower in prior books the towns cities that were traveled through were secondary to the journey to the dark tower tull lud topeka etc calla bryn sturgis however is the entire focus of this book and while that may make some answer hungry readers upset i still found that i enjoyed it immensely the ka tet of roland eddie susannah jake and oy are on their journey under the beam headed toward the dark tower when they are interrupted by a group of people from a town up ahead these people are in a dire situation and need the help of the gunslingers every twenty years or so a group of wolves comes out of the east and takes one of every twin in the town twins are the norm in this world the twins aren t killed but they come back roont which is to say their brains have been basically sucked dry the ka tet meets a man who will be familiary to many king fans father donald callahan salems lot callahan lives in the town now and is one of the main proponents for using the gunslingers to take out the wolves callahan also has a secret in his church he holds one of the colors of the wizard s rainbow and he offers it to roland if they will help rid the town of the curse of the wolves if all this weren t enough susannah has reverted back into her previous schizophrenic state she has created a whole new personality mia who is the mother and protector of the baby that susannah is carrying inside of her wolves of the calla was completely different from what i was expecting when i picked it up frankly the book has very little to do with the dark tower when compared to the previous books in the series of course the tower is constantly in the back of everyone s head but the main focus of the novel is defeating the wolves that take the children from calla bryn sturgis in this novel i feel that king has created the best villains yet in the series he does a great job making the reader truly hate the wolves and you cannot wait for the climactic battle it is also very interesting what king is doing with the whole idea of things from our world being true in their world the wolves have a few weapons at their disposal that might should seem very familiar to you the whole idea of callahan now being in the world of the dark tower opens up a whole bag of tricks and it is apparent that king is going back into this bag with a revelation that comes near the end that involves a certain author we all know and love but of course it wouldn t be stephen king and it wouldn t be a dark tower novel if there weren t a few crazy twists thrown in just for good measure

the other side of literature the other side of midnight is silly insipid and over the top a mess of a book but an enjoyable mess so much so it is unputdownable sheldon never falters from his high gloss nonstop suspense formula and delivers the melodrama goods with panache and style his unidimensional characters may go through every impossible situation known to man but boy are the chapters engrossing his scenes are as tight as his heroines perfect attributes he may not have written the all american novel but he has winningly delivered a bubble gum treat worthy of any beach read seeker martin boucher

an unusually clear book and great for ocr researchers this nifty book is unusual in several respects it is written in an extremely clear and simple style it presents good clear code both in print and on the accompanying cd and it presents a variety of different methods for achieving each given goal for example the book presents a half dozen different algorithms usually with code for edge detection for thresholding and for skeletonization for the most part the book does a good job of explaining the relative merits or suitabilities of the different algorithms its important to say though that this book is not a comprehensive introduction to image processing issues and algorithms such as gonzales woods nor is it a soup tonuts cookbook of code such as myler weeks admittedly dated pocket handbook although the book is written in a style that students could understand i wouldn t recommend it as a first book for novice students it would be better suited to a non specialist who nevertheless needs to accomplish something specific like thresholding or edge detection in short order and with an algorithm that s tuned to their particular application one last thing this book will be very much appreciated by anyone seeking a foundation in optical character recognition 
excellent read for all ages i thought this book was a lot of fun and very informative we should all be so lucky as to travel the world and no less in days but to do it in the past with much difficulty is something else the one thing i found confusing was that the author tended to skip arond in their storytelling but still highly recommended to kids and adult

excellent reference guide this is my favorite handbook for chrocheting i use the pattern gallery to create my own sweater and scarf designs it is very easy to understand the directions 
very difficult to put down once you start reading it wow this is one of the most gripping and moving accounts of personal combat and experiences in vietnam that i have ever read i had great difficulty putting this gem down as it is directly related in first person and the author does a magnificent job of making you feel as if you re right there alongside the subject of the book franklin miller nothing is held back and if you ve ever served in the military you ll fall right into step with the narration everything is presented in all its gory detail so if you re a little squeamish you might want to skim across a few sections the ending is particularly heart wrenching especially the afterword by the author s widow i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the up close and personal views of combat in vietnam 
will help in your practice of yoga have been going to hot yoga classes days a week for the past three months so you can classify me as a novice what i have noticed is this book really helped me attain better form as i incorporated it into the verbal instructions given in the class one area i think that could be improved on however is all of the pictures are taken from a side view and clearly a front back view of the positions would help also some of the text instructions are hard to decipher when it comes to understanding a position overall this book has helped my practice and i refer to it often 
a painfully honest book i found yancey s truthfulness to be refreshing whether you read this book as a christian or someone just searching you will find i am sure that yancey is honest in fact so honest that there are times that you feel like cringing why is yancey revealing family secrets should he point out our weaknesses like that i learned a lot from this book i learned that a relationship with god is a difficult one because it is a relationship between a finite being with limited understanding me and an infinite all knowing god no wonder i have problems relating i suppose one of the most common questions people ask is assuming god is why he doesn t show himself to us yancey does not admit to have all the answers but what helped me to understand god s reluctance to show himself to us is that if he did it would remove our freedom of choice we would have no choice but to believe one of the wonders of this world is our free will i think for those who are honestly seeking ultimate truth this book will go some way in pointing someone towards the scriptures and ultimately christ jesus himself in the end what will matter is our individual relationship with this invisible god one gripe with yancey was his reliance on catholic authors for an evangelical if he is one he leans so heavily on catholic sources that one would think he was a jesuit priest but that criticism aside i would highly recommend this book 
great book from a canadian couple this is a really great book with good information and easy to read format one of the best parts of this book is that it tells about other plans as well in simple terms so you have a better understanding of what is out there for low carb diets i have read atkins books too and this book is much easier to understand the recipes are excellent especially as they use ingredients available in canada at most health food bulk stores i highly recommend this book as well as their cookbook called easy low carb cooking which is full of great easy recipe s 
the finest political novel by an american writer if i could give this book stars i certainly would it is the finest political novel by an american writer it has few rivals maybe i claudius and claudius the god both by robert graves are as good but students of history political science or leadership will find lincoln to be an exception work of literary art there are several reasons why i so strongly recommend this book first this novel demonstrates exceptionally well the balance between self interests and loyalty as exemplified in the lincoln cabinet salmon chase the secretary of the treasury and william seward the secretary of state are finely portrayed characters they both were positioning themselves in the lincoln presidency to succeed him this required careful political skills to appear supportive but make every move in regard to self interests the passages where lincoln wins over william seward into a real honest partnership are masterful and my admiration for seward soared salmon chase on the other hand continues to play a careful game of undermining the president behind his back while playing the loyal servant to his face the passage where chase is eventually confronted by lincoln who was never fooled in the first place is a wonderful example of the careful interpersonal chess moves required in political life second the novel does a wonderful job of demonstrating how difficult it is get someone to follow orders and do the job right lincoln remains totally frustrated with his generals especially the handsome charming general mcclellan with his own political ambitions the man refused to engage the enemy lincoln eventually fires him and promotes general grant mrs lincoln is somewhat scadalized by the grants but lincoln finally has a military genius on his side and lincoln offers minimal guidance as long as he sees the war turning around due to grant s initiatives third the novel does a great job of demonstrating the total hell that lincoln occupied in the white house the public came into the public rooms of the white house every morning to try to intercept the president on his way to his office his wife engaged in questionable kick back schemes with the white house staff his older sons went to war and his younger son dies of swamp fever mary lincoln was a burden to the president and her nervous breakdown after the death of their child willie further burdened this exceptional political genius fourth lincoln practiced careful adaptive leadership keeping his cabinet and officers focused on the grim realities they had to face every day without flights of hubris and fancy lincoln held our nation together at its darkest hour vidal was able to capture the amazing day to day reality that this feat entailed vidal creates a vision of lincoln that comes to life in this fine novel

don t start dickens here but read it i must agree with a number of other reviewers here dont start your reading of dickens with this one but once you start you need to add this one to your list this is not one of dickens most noted works but it is one that needs to be read to understand the authors evolution as a writer i had the pleasure of first reading this one in a volume years ago which was printed in the late s and which was printed for mass distribution fine print two columns per page printing all the way to the page edge you get the picture that was years ago i am too old to even see the print now much less read it but it was worth it at the time and is certainly worth it now that i can afford a nicer copy the work can be criticized with some justification for being a bit wordy but for my taste that is one of the charms of the novel it certainly fits the times and the style of the times recommend this one be added to your list when again you get into the dickens thing 
a great little book djilas first hand account of events keen observations and great writing style combine to give you much more insight about communism and stalin than you would expect from a book this size don t miss it 
excellent book and door stop this book is really useful to have on hand but it is huge for a nutshell book i realize that they need every page to document the code it is just makes it hard to keep this book on the desk over all i think the book could have used more examples on how to make the method calls rather than showing the methods and what they do over all if you need a book that documents most of the java libraries this is an excellent choice but don t expect to pick up this book if you have no programming experience and learn how to call these methods 
game changing every once in a while an idea or an individual comes along that changes the playing field the rules of the game the expected outcomes or a little of it all god is at work has the potential for such an impact i read this book in tandem with why globalization works by martin wolf the coreading had a unique effect i felt like wolf was doing the best job i had read yet of being realistic in his assessment of the free market s potential in emerging markets given the various undeniable and constraining dynamics at work in those places be it infrastructure tariffs corruption education etc then i was opening up giaw and reading very similar things yet in ways that coupled an understanding of how the spiritual world was relevant as well the immediate impression was that giaw was obviously not written by surmising christian business hacks this book had serious weight and knew its stuff to me this was very refreshing as i am an admitted skeptic of christian culture trying to photocopy yet one more secular realm from self help to christian music to christian novels to christian movies now to christian business these were my key impressions few people really address well the corruption tax of developing nations giaw nailed it de soto quantifies it in mystery of capital to some extent but giaw got to the heart with the concept of spiritual capital which i found to be absolutely profound few people really address well the concept that for business to succeed in emerging markets there has to be reformation in every corner of society cultural spiritual political and the underlying economics of the works i ve read most people hone in on the last two i think because there afraid to attempt the first and don t know where to begin on the second because they probably honestly don t count it the clarification of differences between business as missions business for missions etc was terrific and much needed i think things can get fuzzy in this corner and some of the practical application points might need further fleshing out but in general the value of business as a mission in and of it self desperately needed to be clarified among christians again giaw nailed this my one hang up was the terminology kingdom business it probably really boils down to semantics and my previously noted resistance to christianity s persistent need to clarify its christian intent on the flip side there is the need to distinguish the characteristics of the business model proposed by giaw from that pursued by most secular business people so a title or nomenclature is probably required i hope this will be a breakthrough for the thousands of christian businesspeople who have longed to know how they can contribute and who have felt on the short end of the very real yet very wrong spiritual totem pole i hope the church embraces the thinking and that in the long term the game changes in ways that will elevate the impact of this and future generations of believers 
a great story well told i ve read quite a few of the current slew of books attempting to popularise science in the wake of dava sobel s longitude but i think this is the best not only is it a gripping drama with a wonderful parade of characters and tragedies and triumphs galore but more importantly it covers the most dramatic change in our perception of ourselves and the world consider at the start of the book in the early nineteenth century religion still reigned supreme the bible was the literal truth and the study of what came to be known as geology and biology was the province of enthusiastic amateurs but then from the cliffs of lyme regis and from the quarries used to provide the stones for the growth of the new industrial towns and cities came these extraordinary fossils these remains of the most incredible animals plus clear evidence for those who could see of the unimagineable lengths of time involved in the formation of the various strata of rocks in which these remains were embedded the resulting debate was surely one of the most momentous in scientific history culminating in the publication of darwin s origin of species in i think cadbury tells the story superbly i particularly enjoyed the way the story starts in jane austen territory lyme regis early years of the century keen young doctors and clergymen collecting plants and fossils and then as it centres more on london gets darker entering the familiar world of dickens with child deaths disfigurements and the crushing of hope beneath the merciless wheels of ruthless ambitions etc etc great stuf 
i read every page this book is a great reference book and also a great read i read every page of the book and created a careful outline of it which will be available at davidritsema com the book was required for my doctoral program in nt and i found it be very helpful in providing the panoramic view of biblical backgrounds to the nt

a dr laura avoider i have avoided dr laura her books and her radio program for many years fearing she would say something about me i didn t want to recognize ten stupid things did just that how sad it is that women have such low self esteemthough gangi in her book explains this more as the lack of self lovethat they feel they have to settle for whatever and more importantly whomever pays any attention to them if we would think twice look in the mirror and truly love the person looking back maybe we could lower the count from to or

religious but provides almost scientific breakdown of anger i m not a very religious person but his book broke down anger and all the aspects about anger in such a way that i feel much better i know i can now work to control my anger and not let my anger control me while reading this book i even had opportunities to try his suggestions and ideas on my own anger toward my children my wife and myself i was amazed how well it worked there were still times i slipped but i was able to use his ideas see where i went wrong and make a conscious decision to correct it next time so don t laugh at me if you go past my garage and hear me say out loud to myself as my van runs over the basketball again im angry 
must reading this is the best book ever written about female serial killers ever it s chilling truly and what if the person you ve been reading was dishonest then what a masterpiece all the way as well as a landmark in mystery fiction read it in fact just to convince yourself that this brilliant book does work both ways before knowing the surprise and after read it twice so many such stories fall apart and collapse after the big twist ending high tension or fight club anyone not this one agatha knew what she was doing and the proof is in the pudding as they say 
a look at the death penalty this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row at least in the state of mississippi and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam s grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison s chaplain i found it to be one of the better john grisham books 
fun sequel to putting boys on the ledge fourteen yearold frances knew that there was something weird going on when she walked into her friend blue s house only to be confronted by her three closest friends blue allie and natalie and she was right for she is immediately bombarded with an alternative to her crush on blue s older brother theo the solution is that she must join a co ed club one where she will be able to meet some new boys and possibly begin dating so she can finally do something other than study during weekends the problem is that frances parents won t allow her to do anything that takes her mind away from studying so she comes up with a great idea she ll start a study club that way she ll be with guys but will be studying at the same time everybody wins until theo joins the study club then all bets are off after reading putting boys on the ledge the prequel to studying boys i knew that frances was my absolute favorite character out of the four girls so i was absolutely ecstatic to see that studying boys was told from her point of view frances is an amazing character who proves to readers that it s good to be smart and that smart girls can get the cute guys just as easily as the popular girls stephie davis is amazing at proving that girls can take a lead role in relationships and that they don t have to agree with whatever the guy says to hold on to the romance overall this is a very girl empowering addition to the teen fiction genre that will hold a special place in the hearts of female readers the world over erika soroccobook review columnist for the community bugle newspape 
great for cultural appropriateness but needs a proof reader this book has insightful and accurate reviews of culture and cultural appropriateness however if you buy the book don t trust the foreign language words or phrases in the case of the czech and slovak section most of the words are spelled wrong and in some cases just wrong i wonder who did the research they should have consulted with a native speaker before the book went to print 
balzac at his best i love balzac at his best he soars above the rest of french literature and here he is definitely at his finest easy to see why proust thought him the best at his best vautrin collyn is at his most sinister and attractive if you haven t read balzac before this is the best to start with

up to date informed and incredibly compassionate if you just want the latest research go read the new england journal of medicine if you want the latest research plus experience understanding compassion and answers to your most embarrassing questions get this book i heard the co author francesca coltrera speak a few weeks ago i was absolutely blown away by how lucid informed and compassionate this woman was she didn t just present the book as a bible for people undergoing breast cancer treatment though it is that she talked about it as a a kind of lifeline a source to go to for questions the doctors and nurses don t have the patience or experience to answer i hope you don t need a book like this but if you do this is the one to get

very helpful guide to publishable non fiction writing i really enjoyed this book and recommend it every chance i get i took a non fictionmemoir writing course a few years ago and went looking for a guide that bridges the content of such books with the process of publishing them look no further this is it ! the authors use their professional experience to effectively inform the reader how editors think about writing and proposals to publish works of non fiction with this information in hand it is truly possible to write one s book and create a project that has already progressed down the road to publication ! i won t go on and on and try to describe the details but suffice it to say that this book is definitely worth reading

similar but different true but it may help build tolerance i doubt that jesus and buddha the parallel sayings will convert many christians to buddhism or buddhists to christianity i hope that it will help to build tolerance between the two religions which is what i believe is the author s intent jesus and buddha the parallel sayings shows that there are many similarities between the teachings of jesus and buddha both were great spokesmen for compassion and nonviolence however by focusing on the similarities between the teachings of jesus and buddha this book might be somewhat nave about the differences between christianity and buddhism a couple of reviewers have pointed to john i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except by me the reviewers appear to be using the inherent intolerance of this teaching as a selling point for christianity for me it was the intolerance of such biblical scriptures that drove me away from christianity the religion that i was raised with and that i once strongly believed in i could not reconcile how such teachings can be of a loving or just god so i eventually reached the point where i could no longer believe in or worship that god i then gradually started searching for another belief system because of both the similarities and the differences buddhism had a naturally strong appeal to me buddha s teachings against attachment even to his own teachings are especially appealing to me perhaps jesus was actually speaking against attachments to biblical scriptures when he said i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except by me perhaps he was saying that only his words were the true words of god and telling his followers not to allow them selves to become attached to biblical scriptures that preceded him or may follow him ie some have argued that paul was a corruptor of jesus teachings unfortunately if that is what jesus meant many christians do the opposite they attach to biblical scriptures that allow them to chastise the sins of others and let go of jesus teachings this is especially true of his teachings that interfere with worldly profits egos or vengeance ie that which has caesar on it belongs to caesar it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven remove the log from your eye before pointing out the splinter in your neighbors let he who is without sin cast the first stone if someone strikes you turn the other cheek etc regardless of how jesus may have meant i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except by me it is most often used as a teaching of intolerance toward other belief systems books like jesus and buddha the parallel sayings living buddha living christ spiritual advice for buddhists and christians and the good heart a buddhist perspective on the teachings of jesus might help build tolerance between the two religions that is why i am giving jesus and buddha the parallel sayings five stars unfortunately such books cannot change the inherent intolerance of some biblical scriptures that makes the task of these books much more difficult 
great content this soft cover on transparent art though a little pricey finally puts techniques for using this medium all in one place for those who are serious about learning how to use transfer medium in their artwork as with most books of this type the artist crafter must own or invest in a significant amount of other supplies in order to duplicate the projects the book is well done the explanations clear the photographs of the processes clear somerset studio as usual has done a good job 
a groundbreaking work ignore the silly reviews here on amazon that attempt to pigeon hole this work as somehow relevant only if one believes the principles of radical feminism yes young is a feminist but this book is about much much more than that it asks a question that has long needed answering do classical conceptions of justice ie distributive justice adequately account for the diverse experiences of differently situated actors and if not how are some groups and individuals marginalized by the dominant philosophical conceptions of justice which have become part of the background understanding of western civilization it is young s wonderful journey seeking an answer to this question that we find in justice and the politics of difference and the journey is worth taking with her 
good heartfelt advice after reading some of the other reviews i was expecting this book to read like a cancer treatment centers of america infomercial but my mom was recently diagnosed with cancer and i wanted to get her something uplifting so i bought this book i m so glad i did i didn t feel at all as though the book were a commercial instead i felt that the author was trying to emphasize that she was initially ignored by doctors who told her to prepare to die in a few months and then she found a place that gave her hope shes still alive years later i think her point was that if you as a cancer patient aren t getting that kind of care then you should look elsewhere until you do the book was a quick read and was full of caring advice for the patient and the patient s friends and family all written by someone who s been there 
unfortunately it s true i used to weigh and was in great shape that was after i got out of basic training in the military unfortunately i have polycystic ovarian syndrome which makes it all to easy to put on weight due to a hormone imbalance when i came down with cfids in addition i gained about lbs i am now trying to lose it i am not a small female to begin with i am with a large frame so the smallest i can get into is about a i have been bashed frequently for being large in terms of both weight and size i have an explanation for the men who do it usually ugly angry couldn t get laid on sunset small weenie complex and need a target generally the type that go for asian women some females also pull this garbage generally same problems as above but the heat taken by large women from the thin mall chick types who look by their own standards pretty good mystifies me are they really happy as they are or miserable because of their low cal diets that turn them into lollipops heads out of proportion to bodies why are they so mean if all it takes is good clothes and thinness to be happy and to fit in monique doesn t really explain this but does a good job of pointing it out there really are such people in the environment they are evil and i blame it mostly on dimensionality and low iq after all who has nothing better to do than diss people for what they look like while spending most of their time on their appearance otherwise i would have to assume that as monique insists that men are attracted to women with some meat on their bones and the skinny evil ones are worried monique you look great no matter what size as for me i d look better with a little less thanks for writing the book here s another one you re so skinny you look like a pez dispenser with a b tch head

austrian economics murray rothbard s contribution to economic science cannot be overstated following the footsteps of mises human action rothbard s own treatise leaves no economic question untouched man economy and state presents the entire corpus of economic law deduced logically from the undeniable fact of human choice because of the austrian methodology rothbard was a system building rationalist and so this book has little resemblance to mainstream economics as a praxeologist rothbard builds economics not on models or mathematics but using primordial logical principles to explore the formal implications of purposeful human behavior rothbard not only presented austrian economics in a systematic complete way he also advanced it considerably some examples of his contributions to the hardcore of austrian economics he refined the theory of utility he greatly elaborated and developed theories of production although i believe his theory of interest was incorrect reconstructed the approach to welfare economics demolished the illusory free market monopoly problem etc also crucial to his economic theory was his indepth exploration of violent intervention in the free market that volume power and market is included here as it was originally intended here rothbard drives the final nail in the coffin for virtually any argument that the government do anything positive for the economy he also recognized that economic and ethical problems have the same fundamental root scarcity without which neither discipline would be at all meaningful this connection was critical for rothbard as he developed his political philosophy which was systematically presented later in the ethics of liberty considering rothbard completed this treatise when he was only his level of scholarship is nothing short of incredible his footnotes are full of treasures this is truly one of the most important works of economic theory ever written indeed it covers everything and rothbard s clear tempered prose is unrivaled in either philosophy or economics anyone who is alive should read this book if you re dead and you can read well thats amazing but still the book won t be much used to you 
excellent ! a must read this book was the fourth book i read by mark hitchcock i have never been disappointed with his books and this one is no exception he ties the current crisis with what could happen in the near future as predicted in the bible it s the only way to clearly understand what is happening today and what may well happen in the near future my only disagreement with the author is that he believes babylon in revelation and is the city in iraq that is rebuilt there i disagree with that view as i believe babylon in the end times revelation is a reference to rome space does not permit why i believe it s rome but that is what i believe the slight disagreement i have doesn t take away from recommending this book i liked it so much and read it in one day it easily deserves five stars a must read and a serious wake up call for america before it is too late ! 
a must know for all who desire to vote aristotle s constitutional theory is the most important aspect of this book every high school world history should become familiar with the forms of government that aristotle identifies and every college poli sci student should commit aristotle s analysis into their core knowledge of course aristotle lived in a time when social norms were different much of what he writes applies to a different age but the constitutional theory of government remains a timeless set of observations especially important in our times

all about time and more the one thing one can say about stephen teo is that he has figured out wong kar wai in part because he understands the enigmatic director on so many levels part of watching movies is trying to figure them out on one level and then to try to catch other levels or layers on a second viewing kudos to stephen teo for making me aware of the multi layered as well as multi dimensional quality of wong kar wais work on one level teo reads wong kar wai as intensely local and at the same time are intimately global moreover teo brings to presence the iconoclastic quality of wong kar wais experiments lastly teo deftly navigates the reader to the multitude of symbols relating to wong kar wais play on time space and memory teos wong kar wai published in the world directors series situates wong s work primarily in a hong kong cultural milieu as well as explores wong kar wais historical context teo also is really good at framing wong kar wai s work around the literary inspirations and sources however teo does not pull any punches in that most of the literary inspirations are pushed aside and little of the book or movie that are supposed to inspire the movies show up differently in the new creation one could well imagine that teo reads wong kar wais movies as text teo s wong kar wai is easy to read but not simplistic at all he does what few are able to do sustain an argument questioning wong s oeuvre it is an understatement to say that his book is extraordinary because of its range and profundity teo brings together an all inclusive sweep of home grown chinese interpretation to the movies with a not equally matched familiarity with the hong kong film industry teo convinces me of both the local significance as well as the international impact of wong kar wais movies which ironically fail at the local hong kong box office he locates wong s movies vis vis a highly complex local historical background which i would never have understood unless i had read this book at the same time teo grounds each film against the literary readings that supposedly guide their creation this is very difficult to do while still maintaining some sense of cohesion teo brings in an incredible understanding of authors like puig cortzar murakami dazai jin yong and liu li chang while still maintaining a real sense of wong kar wais musings on time space and memory it would not be fair to ignore teo s ability to understand genre teo situates as tears go by as a gangster movie days of being wild i cannot help but agree is an ah fei discontented punk movie cumromance chungking express argues teo is a light romance with touches of noir intrigue ashes of time is predictably a wuxia movie but not really one as it breaks rules while adhering to some very key ones fallen angels according to teo takes over from where chungking express leaves of happy together according to teo is predictably gay road movie in the mood for love is what teo calls a wenyi film evoking deep emotions about love but more importantly repressed desire one other thing that i am grateful to teo for is framing wong s three great nostalgia movies days of being wild in the mood for love and which are a s trilogy the films are linked via tony leung chiu wai enigmatic character from days of being wild s mysterious epilogue and working its way to the other two i loved this book it brought a new level of understanding as well as a new level of appreciation to my viewing of wong kar wai in particular and movies in general while wong s movies move from the narcissism of yuddy in days of being wild and chow mo wan in the mood for love and the doubling of cops in chungking express murong yin and murong yang in ashes of time the mise enabme of role playing within role playing between chow mo wan and su li zhen chan in in the mood for love on the surface it would lead one to believe that it was all about identity just like the works of milan kundera which are also about identity but they are also more than that to reduce wong kar wais work to identity would be like saying that tiger wood s gold game is all about the putting yes wong kar wai explores the crises of misidentification as well as the pathologies of self and others that epitomize an identity without established borders however without teo we would not be able to understand that it is about that and also more miguel llor

love doesn t come with a pedigree with more than of the dogs entering america s animal shelters being mixed breeds it s about time someone championed their unparalleled virtues the care and detail taken by the author demonstrates her profound understanding that fancy schmancy papers or prissy pedigrees are a poor measuring tool when choosing a canine family member this book will go a long way toward awakening public awareness to the wonderful dogs that are waiting eagerly in shelters each hoping that today is their day to earn a loving home well done

a mixture of biography history science and speculation what is it that connects us to each other and perhaps connects us across time lyall watson is a gifted scientist who suggests some provocative possibilities in simple prose if you don t want to think about his speculations you will still be entertained by his biographical adventures about south african bushmen and elephants the only reason i didn t give it five stars is that the author spends a lot of time telling the history of various elephant herds and the men who slaughtered so many of them and that s really a separate tale or is it tail 
laugh out loud hilarious truly affecting it s a book that crosses genres as i m not a parent but i was consistently moved and often laughed out loud i don t often find a book that is actually difficult to put down but paesel keeps your attention with her insight and delicious wit it s excellent

p p with contemporary issues ms smith s modern version of p p is tightly wound starting with the tornado literally forcing eddi elizabeth and dave darcy together to the proposal onstage in the middle of the texas version of p p one will find well developed characters and many similarities to the original ms smith s religious beliefs especially those on abortion were more pronounced than they were in her book possibilities religion was not an issue directly discussed in the original other than to make fun of mr collins i did not care for the sermon in the middle of this story it seemed out of place but it did not destroy my overall pleasure in the book 
the hunchback of notre dame all said about classics this was one of the best classics ever written it fills you with emotion an extremely thought provoking book that talks of love and unloved loyalty and betrayal gratitude and unrelenting coldness reading this book is like going back in time to the th century we can see masquerades roaming the streets of france a lonely bell ringer with a hunched back ringing bells longing to see his beloved girl the archdeacon who by nature may not be evil but the endless temptation made him an absolute devil an absurd love triangle that was almost funny and yet resulted only in tragedy a gypsy prostitute filled with remorse and anger and yet yet everything turned to nothing the famous quisimodo is probably the ultimate symbol of an ugly face with a kind heart he is one of the bravest protagonists i ve ever encountered he has a heart of gold and yet he received nothing that was hugo s tragedy at his best besides an extremely well written book the main thing about this book is that it s heart wrenching and thought provoking one of the best tragedies ever written if you like to shed some tears while reading then this is the right book for you

business book of the year go it alone ! by bruce judson is my business book of the year it gave me a clear understanding of how to operate my websites and internet based services go it alone explained to me the rationale behind outsourcing my internet infrastructure vs paying a programmer to write the code or perhaps writing the code myself it stated a compelling case for identify my core strengths and focusing on that while running any internet business it gave me a clear idea of the competitive advantage that would accrue to me if i outsource all services that are not part of my core strength it made a logical case for not providing services to myself or others that i cannnot sustain a competitive advantage over the long hau

excellent christian resource on parenting teens the five love languages for teenagers by gary chapman is a book every parent needs to own i ll admit i went looking for a quick fix with this book the other love languages books have a quiz in the back to help you identify your language and that s right where i went with this book to the back i was disappointed to find no quiz in this book but chapman explains that teenagers would be quick to figure out how to manipulate the system if they knew that we were trying to figure them out the book discusses the five love languages as broken down in chapman s other books in this series but directs them specifically at how teenagers are affected by them i learned so much from this book about how to talk to my kids and that both of my teens are quality time people during the course of reading this book i ve seen a change in my daughter already she s spent more time talking to me because i ve spent more time listening to her this is a book i will purchase for my own bookshelf and continue the practices in it for the next years until my three yearold turns 
amazing spiritually uplifting this book is amazing i started reading this book out of curiosity to find answers to common questions about the other side after a few pages this book satisfied more than just my curiosity it was a spiritual enrichment i was looking for i was unable to put it down i ve bought this book for several people and everyone who read it is amazed plus this book contains the year prayers that st brigitte of sweden received which contain so many graces 
a favorite book to read my yo too bad lobel didn t do more owl books he s one of my favorites but i agree w the other reviewer who says this is his best ! tearwater tea is my daughter s favorite story in the collection and i don t mind reading it over and over again 
borderline nation this is one of my favorite books i love wurtzel s story as well as her writing style however some of the things that i most love about it are the same things that may turn some people off to it the novel is a memoire and it covers wurtzel s long term depression she writes an entire book about her suffering with this naturally some may find it whiney self centered or even pitiful however people who can relate to her struggle are most apt to find this work none of those things if you ve dealt with depression and or self mutilation and or suicidality i think you ll be able to really appreciate wurtzel s openness i read this book quite awhile ago so i can t recall whether or not she calls herself this but to me i am a mental health clinician she is very borderline having borderline personality disorder although the book is not advertised as being a memoire of bpd i find it to be one the last thing i want to mention is that i would be careful about recommending this work to someone who is actually in the throws of depression it is not the most hopeful work and may not boost anyone out of a depression if theyre already in one 
comprehensive but does assume some background undoubtedly a fine work comprehensive incisive and written with great passion however it does assume at least a passing aquaintance with the actors thus for the beginner it would be probably be advantageous to supplement with additional material 
extraordinary a work of genius these are true tales from a clinical neurologist s notebook but this isn t just any neurologist oliver sacks author of the justly celebrated the man who mistook his wife for a hat and awakenings which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams and other works is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating yet studiously objective a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations historical comparisons and wisdom part of the power of these tales and of all of sacks s work is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality this makes for a compelling read if you ve never read sacks before you are in for a very special treat these tales are paradoxical because defects disorders diseases can bring out latent powers developments evolutions forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence it is this creative potential that forms the central theme of this book from sacks s preface page xvi the first tale the case of the colorblind painter is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty five and the effect this had on his life and work the second the last hippie is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties sacks tells this sad pathetic story with vivid detail and characteristically ends it with a footnote a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears dont skip the footnotes ! the third tale a surgeon s life is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette s syndrome it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination dr carl bennett riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder compulsions that cause him to throw things to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner to flail jump and jerk about nonetheless became a very successful and beloved doctor of surgery sacks scrubs up with dr bennett and goes into surgery with him during which miraculously the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be the fourth tale to see and not see is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination in the fifth tale the landscape of his dreams we meet a gifted artist franco magnani who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito italy through his paintings he has a nearly photographic three dimensional memory but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty one he cares only to re create his pontito not the people or events but the houses the masonry the stones and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail the chapter prodigies focuses on an autistic artist stephen wiltshire whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand in this tale and the concluding tale an anthropologist on mars sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it at least in my interpretation as an alternate view of reality a view with its own strengths and weaknesses a world that is just as true and valid as the normal one of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society yet perhaps that is society s loss i even got the sense in reading these concluding stories about autism that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary strategy trying to emerge that is a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness and that humankind is the better for it incidentally the last tale about temple grandin who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society yet remains autistic she is the one who says she sometimes feels because of her different perspective like an anthropologist on mars when she views normal people sacks allows us to see why bottom line this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition written with grace and a deep sense of humanity not to be missed 
a beautiful adult fairy tale i absolutely love this book its one of my favorites and i ve reread it several times deerskin is such a heartbreakingly tragic character that at times i was moved to tears by her pain mckinley handles the topic of incest and rape in an appropriate manner that isn t too graphic but nonetheless conveys the point the romance that develops between deerskin and prince ossin is poignant and heartwarming when deerskin reveals her true identity and what happened to her ossin isn t disgusted in fact he s outraged and appalled on her behalf he wants nothing but her love and to love her in turn my only problem with this book was the ending it seemed vaguely unfinished to me i wish ms mckinley had provided an epilogue or something that told us what happened to deerskin and ossin did they marry did lissla lissar manage to accept and overcome what happened to her and thereby accept ossin s love at the end of the story she does stay with ossin but she stills seems a bit flighty and i can t help but wonder if she doesn t panic and leave him again but in spite of that minor flaw this book is an incredible story that i highly recommend to anyone the plot is original as well as heartbreaking in its sadness and joy 
good foundational book i really like the way this book is presented it provides a really concise yet complete overview of the disabilities most commonly encountered i also like the pages in the back of each chapter that give teaching strategies in respect to the disability discussed this is a great book for general educators looking for some information on disabilities and for those beginning to learn about special education this book gives a great foundation for all the other special education courses that follow it great book 
great biker techniques these street riding skills will make you a better rider by explaining how to let science work for you have fun and hit the streets 
for former high school players if you have ever played high school football under the lights you will enjoy this book when i started the book i realized it was very slow in the beginning and began to expect a below average book but i kept reading and it turned out to be great ! the end is very exciting and emotional for all former football players i highly recommend this book 
unvarnished truth i am vain enough to think i have a finely tuned bs detector and frankly i think most self help psychobabble is just that bs dr blanton however is not only brilliant he is incredibly honest i particularly liked the chapter where he admitted that he would like us all to read his book and admire his intelligence we all have fantasies like that but how many people can be that frank and honest about it one of the few books i ve read twice 
making sense of the book of revelation overall this book is an attempt to put the coming events prophesied in revelation and other books of the hebrew scriptures and christian new testament into a possible scenario reading it brought those future events more into focus for me we won t know what is coming until it actually happens but i think pat did a very good job of conjecturing a possible chain of events from the bible facts and the collective perspectives that many bible students scientists etc have come up with over the years lastly it will give any thoughtful person a more sober approach to their own life encourage them to consider where they are currently at with god and challenge them to think about what they are going to spend their life s strength on the last day of life as usual is coming the beginning of eternity could start for each one of us at any moment we d all better get ready the sooner the better 
the new one i want another like it mr braver please let us know when you are gonna write one as good as this does anyone else think this would make an awesome movie i dojami 
thank you to the author ! such an important book to write when i saw the title i knew i had to check out the book for myself since i am a bicultural person of venezuelan and polish descent i could relate to his struggle a lot of people doubt you based on physical characteristics surname and mannerisms when you come from a bicultural background the situation was the same for mr johnson a lawyer of english and mexican background his last name light complexion and elementary knowledge of spanish hindered him in integrating into mexican culture while his non caucasian features separated him from his anglo contemporaries he wrote sensitively about his experiences and enlightened us about his process of self discovery finally marrying a mexicana having children with her giving them spanish names etc i reccomend this book to anyone who wants an education on the bicultural experience or has been through that process themselves i can t tell you how many times to this day people still deny me my latin roots because i don t look like the caricatures they have in their heads about how all hispanics latinos are supposed to look dark skin black hair black eyes and i don t have a spanish last name because i was raised by my mom martinez morales rodriguez etc we have to get over our assumptions about people if we want the walls to come down in our thinking it is the only way toward liberation 
great fun for the readers rather than the characters the bauldalaire children are likeable intelligent protagonists but since their parents died in a horrible fire their lives have been filled with misery and despair the first installments in the series tell about their visits with three eccentric gaurdians uncle monty aunt josephine and the wicked count olaf lemony snicket is a mysterious and engaging narrator who dedicates each book to his lost love beatrice who seems to have died in a fire this darkly humorous wickedly entertaining series will appeal to children who enjoy the works of roald dahl james and the giant peach matilda etc like the children in dahl s books the bauldalaires are surrounded by dimwitted adults who believe nothing the kids say this is an atmospheric exciting series that will stretch reader s imagination while it enriches their vocabulary 
african american history done well peter h wood did a thoroughly researched well written history of african americans in south carolina from to the stono rebellion i am african american and read this book for the first time in college it was assigned to me by a terrific professor thomas r hietala i came to that class with my own concept of what slavery was and what it meant this book totally challenged me to question my perceptions of slavery i believed the stereotypic view that africans were brought here and taught skills here and picked cotton and it was all misery and this book and others he assigned showed me how our modern vision of slavery is very shallow this book focuses on the rice growing region of south carolina and it shows how slavers concentrated on capturing africans from the rice coast because of their agricultural knowledge and skills he shed a light on who these african people were before slavery it explores how the cash crop in south carolina came to be rice how south carolina was established as a colony of barbados and the slave owners in south carolina were formerly working class overseers who worked for the royal owners of sugar plantations in barbados and later became land and slave owners in south carolina in both places barbados and south carolina the populations became black majorities it also shows how slavery system in south carolina evolved for the enslaved from something that was oppressive and informal into something brutal permanent and hopeless the evolution of slavery also changed the owners as they became a numerical minority the also became increasingly paranoid determined to establish brutal absolute authority over the slaves and blinded by their own propaganda it seems even more astonishing they began to believe that africans were better off and happy under a system that enslaved them the most powerful thing professor hietala ever said in our class was never forget that slaves always wanted ownership of their own bodies and the power to direct their own lives and destinies nothing was more important at times i think historians forget this when writing about african american slaves wood understands this and he also shows respect for how enslaved africans not only yearned for their freedom but how they planned and took risks for their freedom he explores in depth the complexity and challenges of their struggle in choosing to look at the stono rebellion and the events that lead up to this big risk the story wood tells begins with the history of these two communities barbados overseers who become south carolina planters and enslaved africans continues with the development of the system of slavery in south carolina and climaxes at the stono rebellion the most fascinating thing about this act of resistance is how close they came to success when reading it for the first time i found myself saddened that they did not succeed because their success could have rewritten african american history by altering the issues that sparked the civil war and subsequent events reconstruction jim crow and the civil rights movement in essence their success could have changed my history and had far reaching implications with respect to who i am i think it is worth reading because of the history it explores and because wood is an excellent researcher and writer he not only uncovers the history but he exposes readers to the lives of enslaved africans in a new way by portraying them as whole human beings who had a life before slavery he treats with respect their existence and culture in africa and acknowledges how it african culture influenced the economy and agriculture of south carolina and by inference the south it is a brilliant well researched and written work as a student i came to appreciate that brilliant scholars were not always brilliant writers wood excels at both i recommend it highly to any one interested in learning more about african american history 
awesome i loved this book to all of you who are bad mouthing this book stuff it it s not modern writing but if you read it to read it not because you have a book report due you ll like it i picked it up and could nt put it down except for a breif exception where i thought my bladder would explode but then i picked it back up again i would definitely rate this as a classic and although some of it is a tad unrealistic almost all of it is believable i would highly suggest that if you have a few spare hours you should immeadietly pick it up and if not wait for a weekend or a better time and then do it this book is awesome 
adventuresports institute text i utilize this book as the text for my winter adventure skills course at the adventuresports institute of garrett college very entertaining and full of wonderful winter camping tips not just for backcountry skiing useful for all aspects of winter backcountry travel 
you ll never look at vagas the same way again beating the odds in vegas is much harder than i thought leave it to a group of mit braniacs to figure it out this story is incredible so much deeper than the card counting i expected their system was incdedibly elaborate this is not a book you can read on your flight to lv and hope to gain an advantage this is about a system that was years in the making i m facinated by how successfully this system worked to the tune of millions in winnings 
surprsingly good sometimes this series seems wussy but this particular book is absolutely great you get to read about authors during their struggling years and times of doubt and it s all across the board in writer types enjoy 
we laughed and laughed a really fun read i give this book five stars for entertainment value which was our purpose in selecting this book our six year old daughter identifies junie b s misbehavior and has no desire to emulate her actions or grammar it is funny because she is so outrageous junie b jones and the stupid smelly bus is the funniest children s book i have read with my daughter in a long time we laughed uncontrollably so often my husband came upstairs to see what was going on and stayed listening until we finished the book my daughter came home the next day and showed me she had checked out the next book in the series from the school library when it came time to read her eyes lit up with excitement that s when you know a children s book is worth five stars 
shadows of the dark john zaffis is the nephew of ed warren a renown demonologist who is now retired due to poor health the book starts out explaining how his interest in the paranormal grew because of his uncle as a child and then leads into various cases the book gives us a small peak into cases but really doesn t go very deep into them the scientific and photographic evidence is also a bit lacking in this book you get the feeling reading this book that he edited out many of the darker details of the cases perhaps for the protection of his readers i like the fact that zaffis calls himself a psychic researcher he states the term demonologist is to easily used these days and this is from an older man who has dedicated his entire life to this field i agree he also covers issues that season investigators learn from the school of hard knocks one such issue is the fact that before being contacted about a darker case he also has activity in his own home such as tapping smells and what knot this was something i learnt from trial and error if you are new to this field of study this is a great book or if you simply have never had an experience with a non human entity this is a good book to read

aside from the humor if one is willing to look aside from the dry substandard humor of the author they will find one of the best written textbooks around in any subject taken as a given that some of this material is mathematically and analytically intensive i cannot say that this entire book is easy reading however you will find that the authors due an excellent job explaining and demonstrating difficult concepts they also provide a variety of real life examples to supplement their explanations that help to provide context for some of the seemingly abstract concepts moreover they extensively make use of microsoft excel is demonstrating how to perform some complicated aspects of security analysis in a way that is easily reproducible to the reader 
why no mention of gas chambers at auschwitz reading this book with my high school students led to some of the best literary discussions i ve ever had with young adults so many reviews on amazon com have extolled the virtues of this story one review caught my attention mactans review asking why there was no mention of gas chambers by wiesel night does address the crematoriums as the crazy woman on the train keeps yelling of the fires and those on the train who hated her constant yelling realize the truth as they see the smokestacks from the crematoriums also auschwitz did not have gas chambers see auschwitz a new history by laurence rees for an explanation of why this is true and why the portion of the camp system known as birkenau did have gas chambers

straightforward and well reasoned david mills has written an excellent and quick reading guide to atheism for the practical there is no lengthy exegesis a la george smith here and thomist arguments make the brief appearance they deserve in a book about clear thinking the rest of it is pure gold written with a debater s needs how intelligent design is illogical and a bit pitiful how evolution is a fact not something christians can debateatheist universe starts off with an interview starring mr mills while he is asked questions by a friendly radio host sort of person this is the essence of the book the rest of it is fleshing out of the ideas presented here a large chunk of the book s midsection is intro to evolutionary biology and cosmology some readers will welcome his non science background as he explains in lay terms how science has shown no need for a god in the evolution of the universe and life on earth i was really baffled about his tirade about pornography he devotes a chapter to this seemingly unrelated topic it really didn t seem to fit anything except a deep need of mr mills to say there s nothing wrong with pornography many readers will agree that it may not lead to violent crime but many will find his accepting attitude abrasive to appropriate feminist sensibilities i really enjoyed his quotes from famous atheists nontheists peppered throughout the book it helps the new skeptic understand that many are atheists but only few can come out of the closet due to their fame and prestige give this book a read some of it may be redundant if you re well read in atheist literature and or science but if this is one of your first books it will change your life for the better ! 
ideas on negative painting this book has lots of new ways to use negative painting skills and helps you produce a different style of work this is very exciting and encourages even the inexperienced painter with exercises to practise the only downside is the large amount of space given to very basic and boring instruction on composition and page design 
a universal faith in the global village i used this book as one of my primary sources for studying religions in the global village it was tremendously useful and is a rather fascinating introduction to what is a far more complex issue jenkins writes with a certain level of zeal for the diversification that is currently taking place within christendom particularly in the global south he also writes sympathetically and some might even say supportively of the spreading of the christian faith my understanding is that jenkins is an anglo catholic jenkins proposal now several years old is that christianity is growing fastest in the global south africa latin america and south asia in such a way that the strongholds of christian orthodoxy are likely to be found in the global south by the middle of the st century rather than in the west whether or not this means ecclesial power power being a reductive western idea is not touched upon while the united states is something of an anomaly for the secularization thesis to try and explain in europe it seems to hold true that the more educated a culture becomes the less religious it becomes of course it is tremendously eurocentric to assume that the growing religiosity in the global south is directly related to their sub western standards of educational and economic development rather what jenkins points to is the perception of demonic forces and the fact that a separation of the natural from the super natural has not taken place in those regions in light of a world that very much believes in spiritual forces of evil the spiritual forces of good embodied in jesus christ become a necessity for combatting that evil and more importantly the fact that exorcism of the demonic seems to work further demonstrates the truth of christianity hence one of the more interesting features of christianity in the global south is that both pentecostals and roman catholics the two fastest growing groups in the global south will believe in the supernatural which creates a common ground between the two groups in the area of praxis rather than theoria yet jenkins proposes that when it comes to theology as well as morality both groups will be more conservative in relation to what constitutes orthodoxy for their particular group the only major problem with this work and this is a difference that has only come to be seen in recent months i think is that jenkins paints the global south with a broad brush the global south appears almost monolithic in terms of morality and theology yet in light of the recent crisis in the anglican communion over gay bishop gene robinson it is worth noting that several of the primates in africa were for ending the ban on homosexuals in the priesthood a total affront to the seeming conservativism that is supposed to be so characteristic of the global south while such bishops do not seem to represent any type of majority opinion found there it does show that a certain level of differance does exist which should be accounted for of course christianity in the global south is a topic that people are just beginning to study in light of that it is easy to understand why that which seems to be other or at least new in some way can be painted more simplistically than it really is yet jenkins seeks to understand his subject and does not portray christianity in the global south as an utterly foreign object unlike some postcolonialists or liberals in the united states such as john shelby spong jenkins book is an excellent place to start for anyone interested in learning more about crucial developments in christianity today especially those that will likely shape the future 
mary anne is hero i thought this was a pretty good book but when they fight over who gets to baby sit lucy newton that s what i didn t like about it i thought mary ann had good judgement when jenny got sick also i thought it was pretty cool when mary ann tried to get her friends back together and made a new friend in the process

an eye opener it is hard to say whether all suzuki s facts are absolutely valid or not especially when his discussion turns to what the earth s true carrying capacity for humans is but that is slightly beside the point here the most important part of environmentalism is to wake people up and make them realize the effects that their everyday actions have on the world around them suzuki does this by explaining how everything in this world is connected pollution of one area will invariably affect another area and we really do not understand all the elements needed for the proper functioning of the environment this should make any person reflect on their own actions the world s environmental problems which in turn are deeply connected to human problems will not be solved by governments imposing regulations and all this kyoto b s not that kyoto is bad it s just a very small step and it is disgusting to see that both usa and canada are stalling change will only come when each individual makes sure their own actions do not make the situation worse buy organic when you can afford it reduce or cut out meat entirely from your diet i think of farmland is used to keep livestock alive buy local products recycle compost reduce energy consumption this isn t hippy crap hippies never had that much self restraint this is about being a responsible person so that your grandchildren will be able to go outside and play without gas masks suzuki s book was what opened my eyes when i was and it should do the same for most reasonable people

the incidence of war although soundly invested in the critiques provided in each of the contributions to the costs of war america s phyrric victories i find the refusal by mises intellectuals to entertain extending the franchise of soldiering to the ruling classes and even now to the comfortable middle classes by way of compulsory service a hollow defense mr stromberg whose analysis here as in his articles dating back many years speaks truth to power most lucidly himself has been heard dismissing the james fallows assertion to paraphrase that until the mothers of soldiers in comfortable white suburban towns are ringing the phones off thehook screaming at their congressmen you killed my boy the lives of fallows working class chelsea boys will continue to be defiled in the name of state sponsored phyrric misadventures as they are marched off to slaughter what other than placing the incidence costs of warfare squarely in the laps of the decisionmaking class will stall the state led rush to war surely not the scorn of intellectuals surely not the mature restraint shored up by our shuddering constitutional system increasingly torn to shreds by means of unitary executive assertion alas surely not the thoroughly professionalized allvolunteer armed forces marshalled by unaccountable yes man officers at the beck and call of revolving door insider intellectuals presidents congressmen and captains of industry as they engage in the lapping up of the political means to wealth the overwhelming majority without any experience there 
a feminine take on the martial arts as a karate shodan i m responsible for instructing a diverse student body i work with quite a few women and girls at the dojo so i was looking for a book with insights into what makes them tick as martial artists i ran across women in the martial arts and it was helpful of course i don t claim to have achieved a profound level of insight into the female condition but i d like to think i m less ignorant now than i was before reading it this book is a collection of essays by high ranking women from various styles some of them document their personal journey though the martial arts it was disturbing that a few had experienced physical and emotional damage from abuse and other acts of violence as a result they were looking for a path to empowerment and thus discovered tai chi aikido or another fighting style just showing up to class was an act of courage for a couple of them and even those women without a lot of baggage had to overcome a particular hang up such as body acceptance or dealing with men in a physical manner but despite some struggles they were able to heal and grow while gaining mastery in their particular art i found these autobiographical segments to be inspirational other writers focused on general aspects of the martial arts for example one instructor wrote about developing the senses in order to avoid surprise attack others expounded on the dynamics of women teaching women the meaning of the black belt and even martial arts for the disabled written by a woman who practices and teaches karate and aikido out of a wheelchair regardless of their slant i was fascinated by how they came to terms with a feminine perspective towards the martial arts some of the women had to overcome what they felt was a female predisposition towards passivity especially when dealing with male students others believed that the only way to succeed was by imitating male rigidity and aggressiveness either way once they discovered their power they often became the terrors of their dojo ! at that point they had to abandon their preconceptions and achieve a uniquely feminine balance of flexibility and ferocity both internally and externally some readers especially male ones may struggle with the feminist vibe of women in the martial arts indeed many of the authors began practicing martial arts as part of their participation in the women s movement during the s the book was published in so there s a definite female power thread throughout these essays this made me wonder if the younger women in my class had different reasons for joining along with post feminist attitudes towards their practice still there are good insights within this book for any martial artist regardless of gender

weight loss common sense and taking charge of your life there is so much to love about this little gem the author speaks to you like a curmudgeonly uncle who takes you seriously enough not to coddle you or offer you comforting excuses you want to lose weight fine it s going to be the hardest thing you ve ever done but here s how you go about it while everyone else is counting calories and grams of this and that he cuts straight to the point cut calories may be too few for some people but he gets your attention with the dramatically low figure and exercise again miles in minutes may be a bit much to ask for some of us penguins but he doesn t set the bar too low to be a challenge his voice while caring is uncompromising he is not sympathetic in the cloying manner of many self help gurus but in the manner of a teacher who is confident that you can do what you set out to do as he has and if you don t succeed it s because you don t really want to some people have medical conditions that may contribute to weight gain and his simple approach does not address those complexities i think the author would suggest that you know enough to take care of yourself which is what this is all about anyway he removes the weight loss diet genre from the gnostic realm of medical professionals and returns it to the accessible realm of common sense where it belongs the book is a metaphor for how you can take charge of your own life give meaning to your own life without waiting for someone with credentials to tell you you re doing it all wrong if you don t do it his her way if you re looking for more complexity you may be looking for a program that s so difficult to follow that it comes with its own built in excuses you won t find excuses here but encouragement and prodding americans are not fat and slovenly because we ve failed to eat nothing but protein or failed to find the zone but because we eat too much and don t get enough exercise do something about that and then with the discipline you develop in the process go change the world why don tcha lose the weight and get over it 
a great improvisation is a great treat the brilliantly insightful stacy schiff proves yet again that she is without a doubt one of america s most gifted biographers benjamin franklin springs to life here in all his complexity schiff s elegant prose renders his seven year stay in france utterly fascinating the nuanced portrait of franklin that emerges in these pages will be of great interest to anyone at all intrigued by this endlessly complicated figure and his role in american history i would venture to say that a great improvisation is as compelling as the very best novels the sort that once you ve begun you simply can t put down and this i believe is in no small part due to schiff s prose which is as lucid as it is graceful qualities much sought after but not often found by discriminating readers one would expect nothing less from this pulitzer prize winning author 
must read for those pondering parenthood this book should be read by both men and women though women are its obvious audience the author skillfully weaves together personal experience interviews and voluminous research she uses these to detail women s lives and the choices and pressure they face in relationships work and family her conclusions are too numerous to list but even when the author seems to be stating the obvious she offers examples of those who are overlooking the obvious because of internal or external pressure the book is not quite representative because it focuses mostly on women of medium to high income but the author does include a wide range of subjects what i found most useful were the insights from the different age groups it s clear that while professional mentoring between women of different ages is common there aren t similar support relationships for women of different ages and life stages to frankly discuss non work choices this book helpfully fills in this gap in the conversation

a very enlightening book i cannot agree more with the previous reviewer this truly is an edifying book for those who want to reach out the vast realm of spirituality education and human experience i have read the dalai lama s books and been wondering what kind of education would create a creature of intellect and spiritual with unfathomable wisdom this book helps me to sneak preview the mistery yet it challenges my own perceptions about rituals and religions as well as my belief systems religious disciplines and devotions are always inspiring but in this book they are taken to the next level because they are narrated through a man from the other side of the hemisphere then in his early s whose soul searching quest took him to this incredible journey moreover georges dreyfus was raised in the west french speaking region in switzerland which makes his ardent spiritual transformation through the ge luk scholastic approach to buddhism let me say it much more prevalent he has crossed the threshold of west and east in a pious way many would have thought it is impossible and yet when he returns to our mundane world he can see that there is for instance humor in debate practices in monastery scholastic tradition unquestionable not all of us can take the risk of being defeated in a harsh and thought provoking debate lightly with humor this is not a how to book yet the description of such a strenuous memorization tradition as part of the scholastic curriculum is more than didactic i am tempted to say that those monks will score very high in gre and sat tests yes this book is not a self help one but it is definitely the one that i will take out of the bookshelf every so often 
i could not put this book down this book was very down to earth very interesting i loved reading every word of it was sad and funny at the same time i remember a lot of the times that were talked about in the book and could relate to these in my own life very easy reading and never dull this was a very down to earth book i learned alot about the lewis family that i never knew definately a book worth keeping

another great installment in the in death series lt eve dallas is catching killers once again in this installment of the in death series the story is great with two identical murders of father and son body sculpters it s up to lt dallas along with her amusing cop sidekicks and of course her hot husband roark to find out whodunit the book starts off great but toward the end begins to drag with so many details about cloning illegal experiements and politics the ending is a bit over thetop not giving away any details kids and so unrealistic that it took me a while to get through it an unusual occurance for me still this is a well written read and certainly worth a turn of page 
carl sagan a life worth reading carl sagan was one of the most celebrated scientists of the twentieth century a ma of many interests from smoking marijuana ad enjoying its benefits to prophesizing exciting scientific discoveries it was not a surprise that keay davis was compelled to recount his story in my opinion there is no other scientist who was so multifaceted it is a detailed account of his life from description of his parents lives to those of the famous scientists he met his ambition to find out about the world was countered by his enjoyment of letting the public know more about space through his brilliant books such as the dragons of eden a pulitzer prize winning book and his tv showmanship appearing on late night television with johnny carson facing the jealousy of many other scientists from the attention the media gave to him he struggled to be accepted by the science community the value of his scientific work was always i question with his ph d dissertation almost being rejected his denied tenure at harvard and his denied member ship o the prestigious national academy of science this is a book worth reading because it is about a man who lived his life to the fullest he is a man who can show us what ambition to be best mean and how far your dreams can take you even if it is your belief in extra terrestrial life he was a jewish boy from brooklyn who became the most famous scientist of the twentieth century now that is ambition

another wonderful story from joanne harris blackberry wine by joanne harrisaugust amazon rating starsin this book by joanne harris author of chocolat the story revolves around writer jay mackintosh and his search for happiness the story is told via two time lines the first one dates back to the s where jay s memories take the reader back to his summers spent in a place that was known as pog hill in england out of these memories came his groundbreaking novel jackapple joe based on the man that eventually became a mentor to him joe and jay had a very unusual relationship as joe was much older but wiser and told jay of his travels around the world teaching jay all about plants and healing and the magical power of herbs the second time line takes us to the present when jay has decided on a whim to purchase a cottage in a village in france that he believes is where joe used to live leaving his long time girlfriend kerry without much of a warning his relationship with kerry is one sided and he feels claustrophobic kerry really has no idea what is going on in jay s mind but she has a need to fix him and wants him to write that sequel to that great novel he is now known for the s time line is one of nostalgia but it also has a big influence on jay s present life where he is filled with regret for losing track of joe a man that he took for granted as a boy but now realizes that joe meant the world to him however jay thinks he s losing his mind as joe begins to appear to jay once he moves into the old cottage in the french village and jay s relationship with joe begins anew throughout the story a series of wine bottles known as the specials are always in the background giving a sense of magic and surrealism to the story as is common in all joanne harris novels the specials react to jay s actions and act as harbingers to what may happen next jays life takes a turn when he moves to the cottage as he gains a new motivation to write that second novel he also becomes curious about his neighbor a woman who is known to covet his land and whose daughter is known to the village as deaf and dumb but jay knows there has to be a story here and after he s learned a lot about the other villagers who become sources of potential characters in his new novel he can t get a grasp on the mysterious marise as always i enjoyed this novel by joanne harris very much the book started out at a slow pace as the story is set up but once i got the rhythm of the time lines the book moved faster this is a good read for all fans of joanne harris and readers of good fiction 
superb guide for southerners who love herbs this book goes well beyond the typical growing tips of most gardening guides it fosters an appreciation and joy for herbs both their growth and their culinary applications while growing herbs is a rather simple endeavor there is so much involved in coaxing out their subtle flavors and properties in the garden especially when dealing with the crusty caliche in south central texas from using herbs as delightful landscape enhancements to their preparation in the kitchen this book has something for anyone with an interest and a little time

authoritative english word origins the original and revised editions of this text bring to a wider public the results of over two centuries of work in historical linguistics for many decades the typical books on indo european were dense tomes of closely argued etymological debate and learned controversy over the finer points about how the original language may have sounded of greater interest to most readers with an interest in word origins and the history of english are the reconstructed words themselves and the progress of a word or word root through centuries of use and transformation to the present day as watkins notes in his introduction this dictionary is designed and written for the general english speaking public and not for specialists in the field of indo european linguistics the author a harvard professor of classics and linguistics popularizes without diluting by restricting his focus to english and its close germanic relatives and forbears watkins can include a comprehensive catalog of word roots and their development without causing the book to run to thousands of pages some of the most interesting entries are the language and culture notes for particularly significant words especially in the slim paperback edition this is a welcome book for anyone in love with words and curious about their origins

is this review a manifestation of ultimate truth or a figment of your imagination what a fascinating journey through a bizarre and brilliant mind ! i had always wantedto learn more about philip k dick but had been turned off by other articles andbooks that had drained the life from dick s story with overly dry and pedantic prose in contrast carrere offers psychological insight and philosophical speculationthat can only be described as phildickian as one who had read all ofdick s better known works carrere seems to have reanimated dick s spirit in thiscompelling partially novelized tale what the reader sacrifices in footnotes andverifiable fact is more than made up for by the sheer human interest of the story 
great as a book on tape if you have not heard grafton s alphabet mysteries as a book on tape do yourself a favor and get hold of one and enjoy ! judith kaye is the voice of kinsey millhone she has the attitude and the wit down perfectly of course a great performance with a lousy story still makes a lousy story fortunately this is a great story the mystery is interesting and puzzling kinsey misses some obvious clues but even though i had them way before she did i still couldn t figure it out ! a pleasure

an epic journey the poem of piers the ploughman is often considered to be anonymously composed as the name william langland was less an authorial designation as it was an inscription on the back of a manuscript it would be as if i would be assigned the authorship of the o ed because in some future time the only remaining copy was missing the title pages but still had the hard cover with my ex libris impression on it be that as it may langland is considered at least as likely an author as any other and becomes a sort of stand in an everyman for his time period a few details of this langland are known he was a wanderer a constant reviser the poem goes through several revisions that scholars have designated as texts a b and c and some argue for z this is not a spiritual autobiography as j f goodridge states in an essay about langland in another edition but there are no doubt autobiographical elements in the text that the lead character is named will helps in this identification this poem stands alongside chaucer s canterbury tales as one of the great products of middle english this also has the character of being a different sort of middle english than chaucer s more courtly continental influenced variety thus it gives breadth to the history of the english language langland is often ranked as a great english poet on a par with spenser milton wordsworth and yeats as representative of his age both in topics as well as language facility this epic poem deals with themes familiar for the time like dante and milton langland deals with the grand ideas of the meaning of life and the destiny of humankind however unlike dante and milton will and piers the ploughman do not go through a mystical otherworldly adventure or journey but rather stays rooted to the earth these are dream sequences but these too need not be otherworldly they are things that can happen to every person the ideas of the seven deadly sins the virtues the church and the images of heaven and hell are very much rooted to regular society images of the same the discussion of the allegorical characters aptly named do well do better and do best does much for the moral teaching of this poem which would have been of primary concern to the author langlands text is often more old english than chaucerian in ways it is far more alliterative a strong component taken from old english also it is less metrical in rhythm than chaucer there is a pause in each line akin to older english poetry but the metre is less secure this is a translation of the b text a text that is a revision of langland s own most likely translator and editor a vc schmidt provides an introduction and chronology with lots of detail about the manuscript variations and textual issues schmidt gives examples of the original language for the student to compare the modern translation with a snapshot of the original this is one of the classics of english literature perhaps the least known among them

ah old people just when you think your your spry old neighbor is the father you never had he gets drunk and turns your cat into a zombie some people stephen king for example claim that stephen king isn t exactly deep like many stories about the living dead there s actually more going on than just moaning for brains not that i have a problem with moaning for brains which is often the makings of great entertainment the book gets on the borderline between human being and monster and just hangs out there working it over and looking at it and poking at it until it barely makes sense and you re left wondering if you could even tell the difference anymore that is scary pay attention to what he says about what zelda became and what the living and the dead might become how they feast on the living if you will my criticism is if you set out to exume a body refill the grave and bury it again after midnight during daylight savings time you won t finish before dawn let alone have time for a quick nap i don t care what the wendigo whispered in your ear i didn t see him holding a shovel 
conjures up images that stay with you his prose is excellent but his poetry the black riders war is kind is what stays with me the striking images dark humor and subversive fight against authority bring me back to the book decade after decade these aren t shakespearean sonnets if he was born a hundred years later he would be channeling his raw feelings into writing lyrics for rage against the machine his poetry seems so modern it is hard to reconcile it with the completely different feel of the red badge of courage and his splendid spanish american war reporting 
a book with a relationship i can remember the first time that i saw silver pigs it was in a school library around years ago it was not the story that truly interested me but rather the relationship between the two main characters and its supporting cast the plot is very good but the real meat of the book lies within the relationship between both the characters what is more gratifying is that it develops along with the series and their lives take a life of their own lindsey davis does a good job of mixing both the story and the characters within her books i didn t read it for its mystery but that should not deter anyone who wouldn t want to read it because the lack of it 
a need to read this is a reveling look into an almost invisible aspect of black society that has been around for ages and i for one am impressed true there is some unpleasantness in this book regarding the harsh reality of black on black prejudice but this occurs at all levels of black society and society in general what must not be overlooked is the desire and ability achieve and to escape if at all possible the scars and brutality of being black in a white racist society this is especially true when it comes to ones children namely the children of successful black americans who desperately want and need to shield them not only from the ravages of racism to which young children are especially sensitive and can be seriously marked and marred but also from the numerous pathologies that are rampant in the black community and are destroying black children by the millions the children of the black upper classes are not only taught that they can be somebody but that they must be somebody and that failure is not an option thankfully they can afford not to allow their children s lives to be sabotaged before they reach puberty and have or did construct a community in which they could develop into individuals not as adversely affected by entrenched racism and prejudice 
thoroughly convincing darwinists are scared they are very scared you can tell from all the hystrionic attacks on this erudite logical convincing treatise which eviscerates the philosophy posing as science called darwinian evolution give it years and darwinism will join the ranks of the geocentric earth theory totally discredited and very very embarrassing but just think about it all these guys with letters after their names are going to have to find new jobs no wonder they rant and rail against johnson s sword of reason 
instant classic as a serious photographer just now getting into digital this book has been a godsend clearly explaining and providing useful context to the often daunting new world of digital workflow issues the all color approach with plenty of photographic examples is an added eminently useful benefit i m a mac based guy but this book is platform agnostic bottom line when it comes to real world digital photo issues timacheff and karlins cover it all beautifully

wonderful and reflective in so many ways first i must say that i had seen this book and even picked it up several times in the store only to put it back down i don t know i think it was the cover that made me question it s appeal however i finally said what the heck i have nothing to loose i can always put it down well you can imagine my surprise when i found myself flipping page after page and transporting myself to a small part of the world natchez ms i had never heard of the author greg iles and this was my first introduction to his work i really enjoyed it the opening pages draw you into a story that promises more the story was simple and although there were startling revelations it was not hard to follow penn cage attorney novelistwidow returned to his hometown following a sensational trial and victory to raise his daugher in a small town wholesome environment penn sits on the school board of his old school with his good friend doctorgolden boy drew elliott there is even mention of drew saving penn s life when they were young and they have been friends ever since from all appearances drew and penn have it all they are wonderfully successful have great reputations wonderful children and are the movers and shakers in the town they have it all one would think until one event spins both of their lives out of control the rape murder of a pregnant kate townsend kate is the beautiful valedictorian who was scheduled to attend harvard from her death we learn that drew has done the unthinkable he has been carrying on an affair with his year old babysitter kate who he intended to leave natchez and be with until her untimely demise he he confides is trapped in a marriage with a woman who is addicted to painkillers and the only thing keeping them together is his son through a series of twists and turns the readers finds drew and penn facing armed blackmailers and fighting for their lives penns from a crazed drug dealer and drew who is tried for capital murder where the sentence could be death there are a host of complicated characters mia burke penns babysitter who he finds himself attracted to but not willing to cross the line she is also the amateur sleuth who helps him eventually unravel the case she is also kate s rival in love and school sunny a bitter racist cop whose own ambitions will eventually be his downfall shad johnson the black district attorney who has political ambitions to be mayor cyrus exmilitarydrug dealer obsessed with kate marco a drug dealer war refuge who sees life through the terrifying eyes of a child who saw and experienced too much kaitlin penns girlfriend who doesn t like small town living and several others there were some parts in the story that i would have liked to know more about but overall this novel had everything for a successful story natchez although it appears small and quiet residents and dropping is a hot bed of secrets and desires you eventually learn that there are sexual exploits among teens and adults forbidden love triangles drugs racial tension blackmail plots and death everything is not what it seems i really enjoyed this novel and know that you will too 
an important piece of literature as an educator i highly recommend this book to young and old alike the main characters casper and brendan face incredible odds in their relationship and how they deal with those odds will not cease to amaze the reader mr roeder has given us a love story that at times is difficult to handle i had to put the book down several times and catch my breath and yet so believable gay and straight youth and adults alike would benefit from this story that touches upon some very important issues this is my first read from this author i now want to read the other books in this series entitled gay youth chronicles and i will a definite five star read ! thank you mr roeder for your wonderful story your insight and your ability to create such heart warming characters i look forward to reading all of your past and future work 
a truly compelling story i read this book in my third year of undergraduate study in english this book challenges the paragdigms of the s and s and also serves as a coming of age story theresa is a very complex character whose actions are sometimes laudable but most always easily understood by the reader and sometimes by theresa herself this book impacted me greatly because i identify with the protagonist i am anxious to read it again and determine how it will affect me at yet another stage in my life i highly recommend this book but i especially encourage young women to read it it is beautifully crafted and rossner has the ability to profoundly affect every reader with her vivid imagery and insight into human instinct 
clear well organized guidance this book does exactly what the title says it does it provides clear well organized and specific guidance to building collaboration in a whole range of situations and between individuals within groups and across organizations this book is likely to be useful whether you are a professional facilitator or simply someone who needs to get agreement with one or more others much of its advice is of course widely available elsewhere but this is a good choice for a single reference 
perfect library resource as other reviewers have stated this book reads like a dissertation given all of the works cited the author has definitely done his research and is comprehensive in covering all aspects of dreaming the information presented is interesting and fascinating but the book is not for those who would rather read a novel than a textbook or term paper i alas am one of those people and donated my copy to our women s circle library this book is a valuable resource and is recommended for those who are taking on serious study 
the best book i ve ever read in my life harriet the spy iis my favorite book ever it has been since i was and i still love it its so hard to explain it in words you just might have to read it yoursel 
yes stevens and ashbery yes graham s the errancy is in the spirit of stevens and ashbery perhaps even inheriting their spirits and what s wrong with that this is my favorite book from a poet who has transformed american poetry like ashbery and stevens before him and has become in my mind the single greatest poet in the english language the book is a chore and a treat i recommend it very highly 
hard to put down this was a very easy and fun read and hard to put down the ending was a bit sappy but the book was such a page turner that the sap is forgivable i found myself so engrossed with this book that there were a few nights i stayed up a little later than usual because i got so caught up in the story i hope hollywood decides to make this one into a movie funny adventurous and compelling 
comedy of manners two editions reviewed the way of the world a classic example of comedy of manners did not immediately appeal to me my first reading was the crofts classic edition published reprinted edited by henry t e perry on the plus side the introduction illustrates how william congreve adroitly uses dialogue to reveal much about the personalities of his characters in addition there is a valuable section titled the argument of the play in which perry summarizes events that occurred prior to the beginning of the play the major drawback to the crofts edition is that the stage directions are limited sometimes making it difficult for me to recognize the intent of the dialogue more than once i lost track of the shifting relationships romantic and otherwise however my second reading this time an edition published by barron s educational series proved more enjoyable largely due to the plentiful stage directions and indications of expression pluses include a lengthy introduction by vincent hopper and gerald lahey a page note on staging by george hersey and illustrations by fritz kredel indications of expression essentially guidance to actors on the proper delivery of the dialogue are inserted in parenthesis as the dialogue switches from one character to another example stage directions include somewhat sourly recollecting the rebuff of the previous evening and using frankness as a bait to draw equal frankness from her companion and too preoccupied to pay serious attention the play the first three acts involve little action the scenes focus on introducing and contrasting characters highlighting witty dialogue and slowly revealing details of prior events through casual references polite formalized language disguises selfish motives rivalries deceit and deviousness the action certain steps to overcome obstacles to a marriage does not occur until the fourth act the resolution in act five is not wholly unexpected but may be unsettling to modern sensibilities the marriage between mirabell and millamant proceeds only after both are assured that their financial situation will not be jeopardized love is a secondary concern similarly the unpleasant situation of mrs fainall a marriage without any pretence of love remains unchanged it may not be easy to find a copy of the older barron s edition but it will be worth the effort better yet try to find both the barron s and crodfts editions as they complement each other i give the way of the world a four star ranking 
bullseye spot on ! this book sculpted out the last one and a half years of my life with laser like precision i read it in one sitting and it has thoroughly fortified my spirits with guidance that i m glad to know is the result of the authors experience with countless other cases similar to mine 
please read arif h akhunzada s review with caution i request customers and other visitors to read the article by arif h akhunzada titled bacha khan legacy is questionable with caution because in pakistan objective interpretation and description of history is mostly marred by the official stand on history enshrined in the so called pakistan ideology pakistan ideology i e the idea that sparked the struggle for pakistan is a highly communal theocratic and pan islamist view of history that considers the people of the subcontinent to be divided into two religious communities hindus and muslims with entirely different ways of life and very little in common to live in a single state or society according to this ideology the idea of pakistan was born when the first arab muslim invader i e mohammad bin qasim invaded india sindh and converted some of its inhabitants to islam this divisive and jingoistic philosophy very well serves the interests of the military bureaucracy that has been ruling pakistan since inception and the allied religious and fudal classess as abdul ghaffar khan aka bacha khan espoused a non communal approach to life in which the highest spiritual act and worship was the service of humanity irrespective of religious affiliation and practically upheld what he thought as the true purpose of life evident from his personal life and joint struggle with hindus sikhs etc for freedom he therefore is an anathema to pakistani national elite this elite through a systematic campaign has tried its best to malign abdul ghaffar khan mispresent him to the world and his own people i e pashtuns make him controversial and permanently erase him from history and the memories of the successive generation of pashtuns these elite want pashtun society to evolve the taleban way there is also another dimension to all this the political bureaucratic economic and intellectual elite of pakistan predominently comes from two communities punjabis and muhajirs the other three communities of pakistan i e sindhis baluchis and pashtuns have only peripheral rule in pakistan the punjabi muhajir elite wants to build a pakistani nation based on islam and hindustani muslim culture therefore any thing that gives these marginalized communities ie baluchis pashtuns and sindhis a sense of identity pride self esteem and confidence is virtually unbearable for the punjabi muhajir elite that dominate pakistan i will request the world not to forget bacha khan the values and the view of life he upheld are eternal and humanistic his legacy belongs to the entire humanity rather than a specific community as a pashtun i believe that my people i e pashtuns can achieve spiritual and material success only if they follow bacha khan s philosophy of non voilence and peaceful struggle for personal and collective development unfortunately initially british and later pakistani state ruthlessly suppressed his movement and philosophy the politics of the cold war in which radical islam and jehad were used as counter to communism also have its share in weakening bacha khan s khudayi khidmatgar movement i will further request that readers should read anthropological studies on pashtuns than relying on superficial views about them here and there 
confused get this book there are varying differences between men and women and mr gray takes his time in this book to explain what they are what i got from it was a new perspective a new way to understanding what needs to be understood how to interact with the opposite sex what s most important is to take the time to actually listen without formualing what you re going to say next i can see why this book is so popular now along with this one i also recommend man magnet 
truly inspirational warning don t get carried away by the title of this book it is purely metaphoric when you are handed a page autobiography of an entrepreneur at first you may wonder whether such a piece is worth even leafing through who has the time to read stuff like this losing my virginity is an extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man richard branson one may actually have some reservations about reading about a not exactly well known business magnate i am talking about india of course but rest assured once you read through the author s bio and the very impressive blurbs you will realize that it is far from a conventional boring if you like memoir branson is one of a rare breed a paragon of british entrepreneurship and a genius who has revolutionized british culture and lifestyles throughout this book one can find a real humility in branson s narrative of himself and his experiences like most contemporary memoirists branson uses the confessional mode of writing which has allowed him to do things that a conventional novel will not branson s style of writing is so good humored and his perceptions so remarkable that this book is worth a read even if you don t have the slightest interest in business as one critic wrote about this book heavy but impossible to put down the book is written in a chronological fashion and the chapters have rather stimulating titles the chapters are actual chunks taken from branson s life and provide a rich visual and verbal experience to the reader some photographs both color and black white are there and they complement the narrative beautifully it is fast paced and has an honesty which is a little trivial at times branson reveals much about himself towards the middle he gives a passionate account of his devotion towards music his other great passion adventure some of which have been near death experiences is also dealt with in detail branson s love for ballooning which he calls the most exhilarating of all sports got him an entry into the guinness book of world records a real tribute to his daredevilry bransons tale is novel and is filled with instances of courage the courage to break away from tradition at age branson started a student s magazine and then ventured into music which was a big hit richard branson recounts this as a sad moment in his life when he had to sell virgin records to thorn emi in order to keep a floundering virgin atlantic airways afloat today apart from virgin atlantic the virgin group owns virgin cola virgin vie virgin brides virgin mega stores and many more such ventures which cater to everything any person would want in his daily life now after conquering the world he wants to fly you to space i would hate to spoil the read for you so suffice it to say that losing my virginity is a real inspirational story that can only be told by the man himself such is the popularity of this book that it has become a byword for what they don t teach you at business schools from another perspective it is a comic recollection of life s ups and downs juxtaposed with anecdotes about rock stars politicians friends and foes one finds no moral story in the end no grandfatherly advice to the young blood instead one is left with a deep feeling of admiration and a constant mulling over his adventures if you ever want to know how much a single guy can achieve with talent initiative and good ideas read this book it comes as close to providing the real experience as any book can and for this reason alone it should be coveted 
mark twain at his best i ve been reading a lot of classic literature recently and i also recently saw the mississippi river for the first time so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now this is a nonfictional book by mark twain i guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways in it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the mississippi river then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man as an older man he decides to go back and travel on the mississippi river again he finds the river much changed the course of time the civil war has come and gone the expansion of the railroad and the forces of nature have greatly changed life on the river the once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared besides his personal recollections he also includes other interesting stories historyfolklore talltales and such it is written in typical mark twain style his dry sense of humor will bring a smile to your face i really enjoyed this book 
covers everything this book covers everything and it covers it thoroughly and well ! i d definitely recommend this book to any new mother 
a pleasant surprise when i first received the book i thought i d made a mistake purchasing it but soon realized i had not ! it has proven to be informative and concise and contains background and technique information i haven t seen in other larger more expensive books really a worthwhile addition 
joe black like me review black like me was a great book and taught me how the black person who lived in the south had such a hard life especially in the deep south of mississippi or in new orleans which is the setting of the book in new orleans the white person is nice to the black man but the white man does not respect the black man just tolerates him in mississippi the white person is very degrading to the black man you cannot even look at a white woman in mississippi without getting lynched john griffin who was on a bus ride in mississippi was not allowed to get off at his stop because the bus driver was a white man and a horrible racist and he just wanted to mess with john griffin john howard griffin was a courageous journalist because he was a white man who wanted to turn himself black to see how the black man lived in the south he wanted to see what the real hardships were for the everyday black man for example how hard it is to find a job or a place to live everyday things that we take for granted in today s society the book showed me that racism is a real thing that blacks even in today s society have to deal with the book was great and i would recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn about the south and how black people really have to live their everyday lives 
a must have the book i have is slightly different that what is offered here i have the rd edition of this book which was printed in at that time this was all one volume though quite a handful at over pages the new two volume edition has added the chapters covering the years since the kennedy years including watergate the burger court and what must surely be a fascinating chapter on judicial review and constitutionalism if there is a book available anywhere that present the history and development of the constitution in a unbiased manner this book is it the authors simply present the facts and leave the reader to come to thier own conclusions if you are a student or just want to learn about the constitution or need to research the history of the development of the constitution and what the courts have done to subvert it this is a must have for your personal library my old volumes probably has more notes in the margins than any other book i own you will use it often and learn imensely from it i anxiously await the opportunity to read the updated chapters in volume two monty raineywww juntosocietyco 
may be the best book i ve ever read i know that sounds like hyperbole but seriously he s just so very good at capturing a very wide variety of characters it starts out like things fall apart or palace walk as a portrait of an unlikable man but it very quickly morphs into something much more complex and amazing as he widens the scope again and again to incorporate every one of the people in the cancer ward truly it s hard to speak about exactly what he s doing but as a friend of mine said even with that nobel prize he s still underrated 
good foundation rule one is a nice introduction to the warren buffet benjamin graham philosophy of investing and is written in a way that is much more easily understood than security analysis and more to the point than any of the numerous buffettology type of books town talks a great deal about a company having a moat and gives the reader five metrics to examine when deciding whether a company s stock is worth purchasing the moat analogy didn t really work for me but the principles behind it seem very sound if you re thinking about investing in a mature company by all means do your homework and follow town s rules in addition to the moat town runs through his price calculations several times so that the reader can get a handle on how to do it town exaggerates when he claims that the work can be done in just a few minutes a week but once you ve done a few calculations and bookmark the websites where some of the numbers are available the calculations are simple there is some judgement to be used when deciding what numbers to use but it s pretty straightforward and incorporates a margin of safety element if you are an individual investor who plays the stock market or even one who sticks to mutual funds give the book a read at the very least the cautious approach will probably prevent you from losing money

solid academic research reveals a real woman how many books written for what could easily be a phd disertation can be enjoyed and discussed by several generations of women from teenagers to grandmothers not many but this is one it was wonderful to sit and discuss this this well researched and documented work eleanor roosevelt by blanche wiesen cook the footnotes took up a significant part of the volumn but were at the back of the book so one did not need to interupt the flow of the storey unless it was desired how amazing it was for me to learn about a woman who i vaguely remember only as a president s wife and someone who wrote a column in one of my mother s favorite magzines ladies home journal growing up in the s why was not more written about this remarkable woman who could have taught a generation of women how to make it in a man s world while we stumbled around she had already walked the path we vainly thought we were pioneering yet we were all kept in the dark about her her storey was not taught to us in school although we certainly all knew avout franlkin roosevelt s struggle to overcome his physical problems to become president why only now are we learning about eleanor s role in that fight eleanor had learned to balance the needs of children a philandering husband and the call she heard to make the world a better place one might wonder why women were not told her storey could it be to keep us in our places the kitchen ad the bedroom and out of the boardroom who knows with information like this a generation of women might not have thought their only choices in careers were teaching nursing or airline stewardist how wonderful to read about all the leading women of her time who faught for women s right to vote rights for minorities fair and equal pay for both men and women along with safe working conditions the role eleanor roosevelt played in world politics and human rights issues should have assured her a few chapters in the history books along with her peers elizabeth cady staton and jane adams it is so exciting to learn more about all of these women who could have served as role models for young women had we been better informed about them this is not a mistake that will go uncorrected in my circle of friends this book will be read and discussed with our daughters neices and the daughters of our friends thank you ms cook i can hardly wait to get started on the sequel

good introduction to some of the celtic deities i was pleasantly surprised by this one geared slightly towards a wiccan audience carl mccolman and kathryn hinds s magic of the celtic gods and goddesses nevertheless has something of value for anyone interested in pagan celtic religion many books about the celtic deities are poorly researched present unsubstantiated personal gnosis upg as fact or are just plain wrong i seem to recall one horrifying book that presented the hunter god flidais king stag uh magic does none of these things its scholarship is solid and well researched the authors are careful to make it clear what s in the lore and what are derivative possibilities from it and i didn t find a single factual error in the whole thing go authors go ! they struck a good balance between practical inclusion of the deities in your daily life and adherence to the lore between reviving and upholding ancient traditions and finding your way in the modern world they addressed several basic common sense pagan points that i thought were important making the book very accessible to beginners those sections were slightly tedious for the more advanced reader but i m still glad they were there the suggested correspondences of deities to times of the year it might be particularly appropriate to honor them is very focused around the wiccan wheel of the year so if you just celebrate the four celtic festivals that might be annoying however in fairness the authors do present an appendix talking about the four celtic festivals the linguistic derivation of their names and what they center around there is a really excellent thought provoking bit comparing and contrasting the roles of lugh and brighid in dealing with hostile forces and a related discussion of brighid s role as a peacemaker in addition to her more usually focused on affinities i don t always agree with the authors upg takes on the various deities but they are careful to say things like some see foo as a modern day deity of bar or one might associate foo with bar rather than the incorrect foo is bar and sometimes i did agree their presentation of brighid as goddess of high technology based on her role as a smith is something i and other folks i know have been working with for years so i d definitely recommend this book to any wiccans that are looking to get a better understanding of the celtic deities the authors did a better job than i would have thought possible of writing about the deities in a way that s not strongly cleaved to any particular pagan religion they leave the precise ritual framework and underlying assumptions up to the audience and their religious tastes the book is thought provoking it took me three weeks to get through it even though it s relatively short and worth the read 
honest and clear reporting strongly recommended gerald posner is a fine reporter who takes on issues from which others flee because he reports without an agenda those who have a vested interest in a certain point of view whether emotional or monetary attack him in all kinds of ways when you examine the criticisms you will see that they all fail for example a new york times review of this book tries the old canard that most of what is here has been reported before right so the average reader is supposed to look up thousands of news articles and hundreds of books to get a handle on what mr posner provides for us here so concisely and clearly in about pages including end notes that review also admitted that posner was breaking new ground in his reporting of the saudi ruling powers plan for destroying their oil wells if their power is ever challenged when you read this book i am sure the chapter on the petro se scorched earth report will be fascinating and disturbing while no one knows if the intelligence intercepted is real or false information the saudi s wanted believed it has crucial implications for the world economy if such a loss of oil production capacity were to occur the bottom line is that unless you are an expert on saudi politics you do not know what is in this book and it is in your interest to know this stuff so i believe you will want to get a hold of this book and read it the title refers not to tabloid sensationalism but to the fact that the rulers of saudi arabia are extremely closed and operate in secrecy as opaque as their money power and influence can provide their public statements and the actions they take are for managing their image and have little to do with what they say and do behind the scenes the author carefully explains the very recent and somewhat strange origins of the house of saud with its ties to wahhabi fundamentalist islam from its very beginnings with the rise of importance of oil in the twentieth century saudi arabia has also had a deep internal conflict how to be involved with the western world viewed by them as crusaders no less and still remain true to their extreme vision of a pure islam on one hand they want the power and wealth from the oil but they want to keep the world out they need the western world to help them extract the oil but they want to spread a primitive vision of islam around the globe using the power and wealth the oil gives them they insist on a program of education for their population that has a deeply racist view of the entire non muslim world but many in the royal family live their lives outside the kingdom in deep hypocrisy booze women gambling and wasteful spending they also depend on the wealth and power of their ties with the west to keep the family of saud in power yet their fostering of islamist fundamentalism also brings unrest and challenge to the royal family you can see the princes of saud are a portrait self opposition posner does a fine job of showing us the subtleties of all these internal contradictions americans should also be concerned about what their government keeps from them to protect the house of saud their investments in the united states are not only not reported by our government by an agreement reached with our government to be treated as an exception the saudi s also invest through complicated and secretive chains of corporate offshore entities posner says that one reasonable estimate of their holdings is around billion of course what else are they going to do with all the dollars we and others ship them for their oil they have to put them somewhere are we better off having them here or elsewhere still it is disquieting that our government helps keep this information from us we have learned by sad experience that secrecy and opaqueness seldom lead to good ends transparency and openness are healthy and in the interests of our citizenry we should insist that the saudi s acquisitions and spending in our economy be accounted for openly so the american citizens can make proper assessments for themselves on whether they are good for us or if some other course of action should be taken the extent of the saudi s support for the other side in our war on terror is also complex many saudi s do not recognize their own role in fostering in fact many still believe and promote the idea that america attacked itself that awful day to support the zionists sure it is a crazy notion however it is a notion that is believed by powerful people we simply dismiss this to our own hurt in his previous book also strongly recommended why america slept posner reported on the capture and interrogation of abu zubaydah he opens this book with a recap of this incident and reports on the amazing coincidental deaths of all those named by zubaydah as contacts they died on the operating table in plane crashes and car accidents make of it what you will however it is clear that islamic charities are not charities in the western sense and that money flows from saudi arabia into channels that are used by those who oppose us not because the saudi s are hoodwinked but because ideologically the saudi s are indeed in opposition to us we have to face the fact that while we need their oil and they want our money and much else we are not aligned in all interests views or purposes nevertheless they have also at times taken heat in the arab world doing things to help the united states as well while they may not be our direct enemy they are certainly not our unqualified friends posner does a superb job in presenting these complex realities he does not pull punches and he demonstrates how all american administrations and both political parties have participated in accommodating the saudis most disturbing are the names posner provides of prominent americans who have profited and continue to profit from supporting saudi interests in the us it is disturbing because the work these paid agents are doing would not be perceived by the average american as being in america s interests maybe they could be persuaded if someone trusted them with the facts however it is treated as a public relations problem with massive lobbyist support and complicit efforts to keep the true scope of the saudi impact on our economy secret i also urge you to read the footnotes there are lists of names of prominent saudi s donating to terrorist groups and a lot of other great information in these notes posner also provides a very useful bibliography for further reading 
great writing thin on research easy to read well written a page turner it also contains a few profound thoughts namely the four disciplines build and maintain a cohesive leadership team create organizational clarity over communicate organization clarity reinforce organizational clarity through human systems the fable does a great job illustrating the meaning and application of these four disciplines unfortunately it stops at that there is no appendix referencing facts studies or collaborative evidence proving that these four obsessions really work as illustrated other research based material i ve read does back it up not including a hardcore chapter in this volume definitely lowers the quality of the book but overall i still found it an excellent book well worth my time 
one of the modern books i ever read when i read this book i knew very little of pakistan s history and that doesn t matter one bit even without knowledge of the allegories that can be made shame is a beatiful book describing human emotions conflicts well basically everything you expect from a gripping story and more than that if anything you have to admire the masterful way in which the plot s slowly but inevitably unravel s slow doesn t mean that the story has no pace on the contrary seldom have i read a story that was so well structured as this one i do not like to call books masterpieces but i ll make an exception for this one 
superbly spooky i read the first book the last apprentice revenge of the witch at my son s recommendation and ended up reading it in less than hours the last apprentice curse of the bane was just as hard to put down ! in this sequel you learn a lot more about the spook s past as well as some ward family secrets my yearold and i read the book at the same time and he found it just as riveting as i did although he said i was the bigger chicken i will admit that at times even i had to put the book down for a little while because i was so nervous for tom ward the main character if your tween is the type that wants to climb in bed with mom dad after a ghost story this is not the book for him her but curse of the bane is a delicious edge ofyourseat thriller for anyone who loves to be spooked ! i cannot wait for joseph delaney s next book 
a wonderful novel charles frazier s cold mountain changed me as a writer he really showed me how much i need to learn mr frazier s bold use of period music throughout the novel has inspired me to reach deeper into research for my own books beyond that his careful precise use of language kept me hooked throughout the pages of this wonderful story i enjoyed the cadence and the way new words from that era captured my thinking i say new but they re really old words that have evolved or dropped from modern usage deep in the heart of this rich colorful narrative you ll find a tender love story you ll also find the land lovingly described in a rich tapestry woven together as only mr frazier seems capable of these days the war and it s brutality is described in some detail but it only serves as the backdrop to inman s struggle to return home to his true love and the country he knows and loves being a person that loves the mountains and desires a simpler life i found myself identifying with inman from the very beginning while the film was okay forget it and buy the book there is no way to translate to film what mr frazier has accomplished with the language and the music simply put i love the way he describes the sound of the music try and describe the sound of music sometime it s not easy especially the type of music described here there are many surprises in this novel but from my perspective there is no way a thinking person can read this novel and not walk away a little bit richer a little bit more fulfilled and having their view of the world altered just a tiny bit obviously i recommend this novel in my first novel only one novelist made the acknowledgements portion of my book that person is charles frazier thanks for the lessons mr frazier

an inspiration for shaping organizational change sara lightfoot is an incredible author that writes with style candor and vividness that allows one to experience the context as though he she is actually involved rather than examining the process vicariously the author recognizes that it is important for readers to be able to place these high schools in context visualize the terrain the community and the people lightfoot has done this by working through the inside out much like an artist painting a portrait capturing the essence of truth with a myriad of dimensions lightfoot offers a penetrable look inside high schools whhile exploring the inherent goodness of schools she provides a description of quotgoodnessquot as not being static nor an absolute quality that can be measured as a single indicator of success of effectiveness but a mixture of parts that produce the whole this mixture encompasses less tangible more elusive qualities that can only be discerned through close vivid description through subtle nuances and thhrough detailed narratives that reveal the sustaining values of an institution a quality that is evident of lightfoot throughout the text is that she looks for the quotgoodquot in all six schools even though they are not equal all too often rersearchers get caught up in identifying a cause or over emphasining the negeative aspects while allowing the quotgoodquot qualities to go unnoticed lightfoot goes the extra mile is this respect by bringing forth the good in each school it is through work such as this that researchers can learn many transferable lessons that can be utilized in a wide array of research studies with this in mind i give sara lightfoot s book the good high school a five star rating 
one would think one would think that after writing five completely charming novels about the despair of three orphans lemony snicket would have trouble writing another novel that lives up to the creativeness randomness and humor of it s predecessors one would be wrong snickets writing is strong and hilarious as always it s the plot that makes this one sometimes drag while the story is mostly interesting hearing about the baudelaires climbing an endless flight of steps gets old after a while this is a small flaw in the story and the rest of the novel is very strong it can be said that a writer who creates a character then readers hate and want to physically shake is a good writer and this is what snicket does when he creates the character of esme a new guardian of our favorite orphans who only cares about things that are in this story has many literally strong points that the previous novels in this series do not such as a red herring a literal and a figurative a huge element of surprise heightened suspense this book gives you a lot of information on certain things but also leaves you with more questions this technique is often done by j k rowling author of the harry potter series and is a big reason for the series success readers will surely want to come back to have their questions answered and with the ersatz elevator mr snicket had undoubtedly secured a returning audience if all of the above doesn t convince you to read this sixth volume in a series of unfortunate events know this reading snicket s fun and informative narration will improve your vocabulary

swell introduction although i note some of the other reviews of this book are not too favorable for me it s a very cool introduction to an artist of whom i had never heard i received it for a gift from a good friend who knows that as an artist color is my thing to learn of this woman who worked color to its absolute max during the years i was growing up is thrilling if nothing else it has inspired me to seek out more of her work what can be bad about that if a book doesn t serve the reader observer by piquing one s further interest then and only then has it failed

interesting preview an interesting preview of his later classics on the life of hitler hubris and nemesi 
but i digress mr slezkine has prepared an interesting but albeit lengthy and sometimes convoluted but usually engrossing premise based on the idea that anyone who is to be prepared for the understanding today s economy and one s place in it must also comprehend the loss of the familiarity of common cause and that in the end all people in this new technological age are interrelated in the way that they never were before having only arrived here meaning the united states in prior to the fall of communism yuri is it ok if i call you yuri or would you prefer professor or the nomencultura of academician being in fact of russian decent and therefore perhaps looking at the use of his first name without a patronimic as being too familiar except that me being an american he would know that there is a tendancy of us americans that is to consider everyone who you have met or in this case read to be on a first name basis brings a novel but not in the sense of a fiction book idea to fruition in a slightly long exposition not in the style of tolstoy or solzhenitsyn and in some cases convoluted but not like a nautilus on a subject that has hithertofor been ignored in both judaic or jewish studies and economics to a point where it loses some of it s brillance in the dust of a run on sentance or paragraph this is not to say that the book or is it polemic is not worth reading it s just that it would have been a much more effective opus had his editors and i suspect that there must have been times that they also were overwhelmed done a better job not that i have anyway to judge how they do their jobs which i suspect they are very good at or they would be looking for other work unless of course they came to editing by way of a failed at reigning in his tendancy to overstate a fact to the point of beating a dead horse so thoroughly uh hopefully by now you get my point succinctly good book interesting idea waaaay tooo loquacious garrulous and talkative

fairy tales for adults i m a huge fan of italo calvino but it is hard to describe exactly what quality makes his books so wonderful in one sense this book is two fables that read like adult fairy tales a knight who inhabits or doesn t a suit of armor and a nobleman who is split into two distinct personalities he also has a style of writing that is almost liquid and translucent it absolutely glitters i would add that the translation is superb i highly recommend this book to anyone 
the title says it all the numerous apoplectic comments posted for this book have successfully proven the author s point george w bush has indeed driven the liberals insane 
the seven story mountain it was quite refreshing to read such clear prose describing a journey of faith from over half a century ago merton is writing from his time period aware of prejudices and doubts from the ww ii era but there is timeless message about the beauty and power of faith interesting that a monk who took a vow of silence is one of the th century s most eloquent writers able to convey what he thought and felt as a young man growing up in france england and the united states in the shadows of war

a literary masterpiece perhpas i m a bit behind the curve here i mean shogun has been published for quite some time but given that i was a young lad during its height of popularity maybe i can be forgiven somewhat this is the book that launched me on my literary quest to read through clavell s asian saga and arguably the best of that saga tai pan king rat noble house gai jin i bought a used version of the book on a whim at a yard sale and it sat on my bookshelf for nearly a year before i finally decided to see what it was about once i picked it up i literally had trouble putting it down i took the book with me on vacation and it was here that i found that the version i had purchased was only the first volume of a two volume set i immediately went out and purchased the whole book needless to say i read the saga in chronological history as opposed to published history and found the whole series extremely entertaining additionally as a student of east asian history i found clavell s historical fiction to be educational as well much akin to shaara s the killer angels i recognize that it was not meant to be a historical document but it certainly allows the layman to get a sense of japanese history and culture in short despite being a doorstopping tome and thank goodness it is i think i would have gone through withdrawals if it were any shorter i cannot give enough praise to this book 
a classic well let us think about this a little bit you want to learn category theory whether for some course or just for the fun of it and now where do you turn in order to learn the necessary concepts if you are a mathematician and have some experience then you turn to the masters the originators of the given subject and read their work sure being the founder of a given subject does not imply that you are a good expositor and hence are capable of revealing the necessary concepts for the beginner allow me to inform that mac lane is indeed as good as an expositor as he was a mathematician for any doubters i point you to the only other text you should read on category theory namely quotcategory theory quot by horst herrlich and compare this text with mac lane s aside from that and with respect to the text for most beginners or interested readers i would suggest the following outline read amp possibly all of as for skip section all of then dependent upon your desires and or focus as well as your mathematical ability it should become obvious which of the remaining topics should be read finally the only other source i would recommend for learning category theory can be found on line using the keyword awodey anyways enjoy and good luck 
review on catwings a great but short book by ursula le guin hi ! you can call me storymaker i just read catwings a wonderful book by ursula le guin i checked it out from the library just the other day ago it is a wonderful book that starts out about a cat named mrs jane tabby a tabby cat that lives in the alley she is very surprised when her kittens are born because guess what the kittens have wings ! however one day jane thinks she knows why her kittens have wings she can t afford to live in the noisy dangerous alley any longer and the least she can do is give her kittens a chance to escape one day jane tells her kittens to fly far far away after some weeping the four wonderfully winged cats fly away as their mother instructed if i continue this i will litter my little review with plot spoilers so i better stop anyways the story of catwings is extremely great however it is probably the shortest chapter book i ever read only pages total ! this book s reading level is pretty low and if you re a mother who wants to get your kids to read longer books you probably don t want to depend on catwings to sasify your teaching needs unless you want to get a child to read thier very first chapter book another complaint is that there s a tiny bit of bloody talk on one page however the plot and pictures are so good that this book still is a full star book signed storymaker gotta trust the kid s review ! 
one of the best writers of all time one of the best i have ever read also red his other book snow but this one is i think is one of the best reads i had highly recomended 
great book this was a great book which really helped me get a good foundation on clean web page design easy to read and great examples 
my son loves this book he will dig through his basket of say books just to find this one he is too young to read and has trouble even waiting for me to page through it with him but if i leave him alone this is the book he picks i suppose it is the primary colors and the simple shapes i suspect i will have to pick up some more of barton s books to see if they work too 
a must have reference keelan parham shows beginners and experienced artists an excellent approach to the art of drawing caricatures you ll find this book to be a comprehensive entertaining exciting and easy to follow tutorial filled with start tofinish examples keelan explains the value of line quality simplicity accessorizing and much much more this book is written for anyone who draws or is interested in drawing caricatures and best of all it s fun i highly recommend it 
worked for me as a relatively new archer i found the simple explanations defining the fundamentals to be extremely helpful my son and i shoot d targets which simulates hunting as well as target shooting for fun indoors my scoring improved tremedously and when i do falter i simply return to the fundamentals i recommend this for any instinctive shooter and would like to find a distributor in canada for shooting friends as i don t want to lend my copy out 
totally not racist nicely brave about race relations i think people mean to say some of the reviews i have just read are rather misleading if you are a white male who is secretly racist this book will validate your feelings uh uhi discovered this book when the times put it on the top list it is a story of a gen xer white male working class growing up during detroit s decline the main theme is the white flight and resignation whites feel about a mayor coleman young who is clearly paranoid and unprofessional at the very least clemens refuses to join in the race prejudice that is relatively easy and done on a low level but when a legitimate anger towards a criminal who raped his wife comes up and he learns the attacker is black he briefly feels tempted down that path but he never does basically forever pondering race relations and how to connect to black people beyond the coleman young white flight civil rights cliches everyone falls back on incidentally there are a lot of funny scenes here of clemens growing up typically male and goofing off with his friends women are treated with respect although face it this is not a book about clemens and women ! duh obviously women are not centra characters much of the time detroit itself is also there are lots of positive blacks his coworkers at the parks deptartment his coworkers at the city office his roommate dont let someone s predictable need to race bash keep you from reading yet another memoir trying to jump into the charged atmosphere of race and try to be evenhanded about things ! 
a model of life in love with food and cooking buy it jamie oliver s first book the naked chef was published shortly after his success with the short run bbc series of the same name when jamie looks to be not much more than while it was easy to understand the quality of his fourth american publication jamies kitchen it is a little surprising to encounter the quality in his very first book until you read of his culinary apprenticeship under both antonio carluccio and gennaro contaldo of the neal street restaurant and rose gray and ruth rodgers of the river caf in london plus a journeyman s stint with a major restaurant in paris young chefs do not get stints with these venues without some serious abilities above and beyond their three years at the westminster catering college his working to carluccio certainly explains his love of fresh ingredients his visits to the local greengrocer and other markets are not a tv gimmick a gourmet magazine writer was visiting the london open air markets collecting information for a story when they ran into our boy jamie off camera doing exactly the kind of ingredients collecting he does at the beginning of each of his tv shows i also understand the background of his simple approach to food after having reviewed three cookbooks from the river caf duo gray and rodgers this first book was done not long after he left their service and in many ways it reads like another gray rodgers effort except that our jamie has added a few good touches of his own to enhance the material as the flyleaf clearly explains the naked moniker refers to the style of food preparation practiced and promulgated by monsieur oliver and not a comment on his attire while cooking be very clear about the fact that this is not the same as fast or even easy however most of jamie s recipes are relatively easy for a moderately talented home cook naked primarily means dishes which are prepared from ingredients which are as close as possible to the soil the sea and the pasture and it means that the food is prepared with a minimum of fuss and measuring jamie firmly believes in the maxim that good cooking is acquiring the very best ingredients and doing as little as possible to muck them up the first indication that this book is not about fast is when jamie gives us two recipes for homemade pasta and goes on to give many many recipes which use this homemade fare with the full expectation that you will take the time to make these yourself true to his river caf roots there are many good pasta dishes in this book the homemade ravioli and tortellini recipes alone may be worth the price of admission the seafood recipes are a close second in their simplicity and appeal to the mind s taste buds the chapter on meat poultry and game broadens jamie s horizon to include pork and lamb dishes inspired by american british and north african cuisines there are four variations on roast leg of lamb a real boon to lamb lovers like myself roasted chicken and duck get a turn in jamie s oven as well jamie returns to his italian inspiration at the end of meats with a rather elaborate meatball recipe that includes just about every spice in the italian pantry plus the usual bread egg cheese and mustard for mortar this recipe is a perfect example of where jamie may be overlooking some finer details for the sake of simplicity the meat is simply meat for grinding or bought ground meat there is no suggestion of beef and pork and veal mixtures the simplification goes further in suggesting that unground meat can be made ready by giving it a whizz in the food processor my favorite foodie nerd alton brown gives detailed instructions for grinding meat in a food processor as a heavy finger on the on button can easily turn your choice chuck into choice mush the chapter on vegetables covers a lot of familiar mediterranean territory but it also branches out to the orient for a stir fry recipe and a vegetable tempura jamie really dips into his love of the mediterranean cuisine by devoting an entire chapter to legumes i would expect a true brit to talk up potatoes but not our jamie and he will have nothing to do with canned beans all recipes in this and other chapters call for beans soaked overnight this fits the cheap and easy but not necessarily quick theme of the book the stars in this chapter include cranberry beans chickpeas yellow split peas green lentils black eyed peas lima beans and cannellini beans another paean to the mediterranean is the next chapter on risotto and couscous i m really surprised to find that jamie s favorite risotto recipe includes both rice and beans however a little reflection reminds me that this is simply another marriage of foods which have been complementing one another for centuries the couscous recipes touch the high points with two hot dishes and a salad jamies chapter on bread is another sign that his style is all about simplicity and not speed his basic recipe is pure italian using classic italian techniques and durum semolina flour i have done oliver bread recipes with great success so i heartily recommend his contributions to everyday bread baking for a relatively small book the variety of bread recipes is really impressive compared to the bread chapter the dessert chapter is rather short and sweet focusing on conventional english and italian standards jamie oliver is not giving us quick cooking he is not even aping river caf works and giving us good simple italian cooking jamie oliver is promoting a lifestyle based on good cooking from basic ingredients jamies recipes may be a bit too simply stated for a complete novice but i am ready to sign up for his view of home cooking with naked ingredients how about you 
quite simply a fun book to read whether you are a fan of the bond movies or you enjoy a good spy novel ian fleming s casino royale is an excellent place to start the novel served as the worlds very first introduction to iconoclastic superspy james bond who is easily one of the most recognized fictional characters in recent memory this one book spawned a movie franchise currently films strong spanning over four decades as well as a number of independent films and a massive collection of non fleming novels if that is not enough reason to give casino royale a try i will give you a few more although a bit outdated at this point the cold war setting provides a great introduction to james bond the story finds the veteran agent on his way to the casino in hopes of foiling the smersh basically the soviet version of the cia agent le chiffre s plan to regain smersh money he mistakenly invested the goal is to force le chiffre to seek sanctuary with the british or american secret services in exchange for information bond the best gambler in the secret service is sent to break le chiffre s bank the story starts off a little slow filling the reader in on background information about some of the important characters and institutions but quickly picks up pace and does not slow down for a page fleming does not waste words his descriptions are only as detailed as they need to be instead of devoting pages and pages to detailing a characters appearance or whatever fleming provides some broad brush strokes and lets the reader fill in the details this allows the reader to develop a personal connection with the characters letting us create a bond with bond that pun really was not intended and the other prominent characters that makes us truly care about the outcome the action scenes are minimal but efficient the lengthy gun fights in the movies are much more restrained and in truth much more realistic a secret agent would try to remain secret not just walk in with guns blazing casino royale is a gritty novel it is no way a glorification of secret agency but instead a mere description of it showing the reader what life is like for an agent flemings characters are quite intriguing le chiffre is a truly hateable villain whose cruelty will make most any reader cringe vesper the lead female is a delightful character whose wit makes you laugh and whose melancholy is at times palpable and of course bond is a truly admirable character that will appeal to any reader he s tough intelligent courageous persistent and above all very human bond s humanity is often lost in the films yet in casino royale he can be wrong and he can lose in conclusion there is a whole lot to like in casino royale a fast paced intense plot likeable heroes and detestable villains strong but brief writing brevity is after all the soul of wit if you are looking for the novelization of the recent film adaptation however you may be disappointed there is no tremendous chase scene to start off the movie or a brutal fight in a stairwell against a man with a machette but there truly is a whole lot to like quite simply its a fun book to read

yea ! good book i really liked this book it was funny and well written and all those things that you like in a book however all of the reviews i read of this book said that mary anne was to blame but i think dawn was a little too what i mean is she wasn t very sympathetic to mary anne poor mary anne was moving into a brand new house with a new family a whole new lifestyle and even though she had wanted to live with dawn and wanted their parents to marry any big change is hard i wish dawn had seen that oh well great book ! perfect for a funny read 
john densmore s experience with the doors john densmore is a musician involved in multiple projects he has also been involved in the theater but the like it or not he will be forever remembered by millions of people as the drummer for the doors a rock band that had a month run from to in this book he recounts those days riders on the storm is a combination of his first person recollection of the events and a letter to jim morrison the charismatic artistic leader of the doors who died in paris in from drug alcohol abuse in this letter the author pours out his feelings about those days questioning morrison s motivation and expressing the things he never did while the lead singer was alive john densmore ray manzarek and robby krieger although competent musicians and talented songwriters have always stood in the shadow of jim morrison in fact on the cover of this book we find densmore behind morrison peering over his shoulder the author tries to move of the background asserting that he had a more important role in the band and several times that he is a superior drummer densmore give us little to indicate that he thinks very much of manzarek we also see a bit about his maturation as a person remember that these were four young men in their twenties trying to figure things out with the extra distraction of fame fortune and all that comes with it he shares a lot about his relationship with his girlfriend his philosophical growth and the conflicts of his lifestyle with his catholic upbringing we see the conflicting thoughts as he recalls the good old days of the door s sometimes dark music and riotous concerts but bemoans its use in dark riotous and violent movies a la apocalypse now the young densmore put down materialism yet owned a home and a jag we see how he and the remaining members of the band did not want to sell out yet continue to produce books collections and videos hey everyone s got to make a living morrison was spared from selling out by drinking himself to death hence the mystique this is not supposed to be a work of literature but one man s thoughts and feelings as such there will be conflicts contradictions and emotion this is what make us human this is not written as an official history but as a personal one as such there will be discrepancies from other accounts if you add this to other accounts of those days you will probably get a fairly accurate picture of how it really was doors fans should pick this one up

a review of sign of the beaver sign of the beaver reviewelizabeth george speare writes in a fashion that always gives you something new to be excited about and lets you exist in her writing this heart stopping book will delight those who love a creative mix of drama adventure friendship and well paced wording i m sure those people will agree with me that describing this as a good book is an understatement it tells of a settler boy and an indian boy who meet and have many adventures in the woods of maine the characters are wonderful because their personalities are almost everyone in the world i do not know a single person that cannot relate to these characters in general it s a two thumbs up read

a chapter apiece for the ladies of brewster place gloria naylor s book reads fast just like life is lived on the little dead end street known as brewster place really a series of inter connected short stories it can easily be read a chapter at a time cuz each character gets her own chapter while not all the characters are thoroughly likeable they all have plenty of redeeming qualities focusing not only on the women s trials and tribulations naylor also delves into the history and background that came before contributing to each woman s present situation these women mostly abandoned or cast off by the men in their lives struggle to make a sense of community from a handful of hopes and dreams

naked sedaris bears all nothing s sacred to david sedaris as fans of his have come to discover and appreciate his entire family is a sacrificial lamb to his sometimes scathing sense of humor and anyone who crosses his path the wrong way is thrown onto the pyre just as quickly sedaris dissects people to the point of making them caricatures and yet they always ring true no matter how ridiculous my favorite example is from the essay planet of the apes in which a young david hitchhikes home from the movie theatre and accepts a ride from a crass old woman who asks him to just tell me where you live pinocchio and save the baloney for lunch regardless of whether people actually speak this way all of us can say we ve met some form of this woman and david nails her in this description sedaris is good for leading his readers through his own form of literary slapstick and then hitting them with some sad truth in the end he does this quite well in the drama bug in an odd moment of admiration instead of lampoon of his mother and get your ya yas out with an equally tender look at his often satirized father underneath the jokes and the bearing of dirty little secrets is a genuine love in the sedaris family which keeps these essays from sinking into either too dark humor or a general mommie dearest like look back in anger sedaris s family may drive him crazy but the feeling is mutual and that levels the playing field a bit 
profound observations the art of virginia woolf gathers in this small yet profoundly moving observation of the cycle of life a garden in july becomes a canvas upon which woolf paints a new and haunting picture of her intricate perspective flowers seem more like immense stained glass windows from the vantage point of the snail making its way through a flower bed minute clips of towering passersby illustrate the human experience where so much is anything but what it appears to be on the surface the flower bed magically transforms through the hypnotic prose becoming an endless landscape of challenge yet more importantly a sacred cathedral wherein the vulnerable snail a methaphor for the individual carefully negotiates life inside the surrounding looming beauty this story crys to be read out loud and when it is it shines and verifies the genius of its conception 
perfect summer fun for fans of jbj this book is a wonderful companion your kids can follow along with jbj as she writes her journal and they can fill in their own versions on the next pages my year old devours the jbj books in about minutes but she has spent hours and hours on this it was especially great for the summer because it gave her a chance to practice her writing skills 
finally a book with some science after shelves upon shelves of books magazines and essays have been written about the brain science behind our childrens developement we finally have a book that actually discusses the evidence rather than shaping it for a particular goal mr bruer is not an advocacy group he s not a political action committee he has researched his book thoroughly sourced it and even interviewed the original scientists whose studies were horribly misinterpereted misconstrued or just plain misused if you listen to the media there are mountains of data regarding the connections between your baby s environment and his her brain developement mr bruer lets us hear from the scientists themselves that this is not true they tell us that what little scientific evidence we have regarding such connections is incomplete and should not be extrapolated to any practical parenting curriculum in sum we should raise our kids with common sense love and care what a comfort that such a time honored notion should still prove true 
great expectations as a future teacher of yoga i found idea of such book absolutely incredible i even had in mind of writing something like that myself models are great in this book but i wish it is organized more differently in a way that each asana shows muscle involvement regarding to its intensity and role agonist antagonist isometric support and so on that way i would find the book extremely useful as it would help me target my exercises with greater efficiency

another fun read from nevada barr i ve been tearing through nevada barr s anna pigeon mysteries ever since i discovered them the tighest and best story in my opinion is firestorm this one was a little harder to follow and i m not sure i ever totally understood the denouement of the mystery but like with all the pigeon novels the characters and physical setting were interesting and well drawn and the story arcs that continue from book to book are intriguing such as the relationship between anna and her sister and the relationship between anna and frederick the fbi agent be prepared to be surprised i don t think i m going to read anything else until i ve finished all the anna pigeon books out there on to blind descent ! 
hilarious and sad warning about the pitfalls of self pity as many critics and nay sayers have said about this book about a sports fans who lives vicariously through sports heroes while drinking and watching life pass him by this autobiographical novel is indeed an indulgent exercise but that is the point self indulgence self pity self absorption are killers they leave us inert exley s self deprecation and humor elevate this from naval gazer narcissism to a theme about men and their meaning of life crises many american men obsess over sports because sports provide a venue for their fantasies of masculinity heroism and self worth that exley was able to take this subject which affected him very deeply and make the pathology universal is a great achievement in this book a novelization of his life told with brutal honesty self introspection and wisdom for an updated novel about today s adults still trapped in adolescence check out tom perotta s comic novel little children 
an excellent reference with a clarity of presentation and personal anecdotes bernhard suess masterfully presents techniques and information quite useful to both amateur and skilled photographers there was a wealth of information presented in this book which significantly improved both my compositional and printing skills amidst a plethora of books available on the subject i feel that suess makes an exceptional effort to make the topic as accessible as possible there is a minimum of technical jargon that is not explained which should appeal to the neophyte and there are several tricks and techniques that would appeal to the more experienced photographer i highly recommend this book 
brutally honest americana sam shepard is an american original i first encountered his work at the public theater in nyc in the early to mid s then having seen buried child i knew i had to read his work his language is spare tough and elagaic like cormac mccarthy s novels of the southwest the best work hee oare the first three plays true west buried child and curse of the starving class shepard is a poet of the interior his convaluted families express despair over hideous personal tagiedies buried child or their own inability to love true west shepeard use of language is interesting it is its strongest when it reflects the rhythm of a place or time curse of the starving class and for me at least is most evocative of a place either real or imagined very much shepard country i saw a young john malkovich in a shepard play now far better known for his acting the right stuff et al when buried child first premiered he was still a poet playwrite living out west who refused to fly and who was commisioned by bob dylan to write a screenplay for his abortive rolling thunder review movie renaldo and clara brilliantblistering theatre that has held up well these years a true american master highest possible recommendation 
know thy self in my humble opinion ramana maharshi was is one of the greatest saints of the modern era in this precious little book he speaks to us from the viewpoint of eternal brahman the ground of all being this wonderful little book is a collection of questions his many visitors would ask his answers are as close to true knowledge of the divine as anything i ve ever heard or seen this book is an excellent introduction to the sublime words and methods of this modern saint this could be a very important guide for the sincere spiritual aspirant who wants to finally know his or her true identity these truths can take us where knowledge is known by direct perception and words alone utterly fail us 
unbiased book on the subject the author covers a long period of this one century old conflict he makes alot of efforst in maintaining an unbiased view of the events and covers the the important events and incidents of this conflict this book can be used as a good starting point to learn about the enormous web of people events plots plans wars that shaped and still shaping this conflict without a forseeable end 
an all class act many of us who appreciate the work of truly great non fiction writers were deeply saddened by the recent passing of alistair cooke although best remembered for his long running radio commentary a letter from america and his various television shows of early years it makes for a pleasant change to go back and rediscover some of mr cooke s more substantial literary efforts a graduate in english literature from cambridge university and a print journalist of considerable experience alistair managed to perfect a difficult balancing act throughout his long and prestigious career he steadfastly adhered to the highest professional and intellectual standards while still managing to enjoy enviable success within the mass media in many ways he raised the bar in regard to industry standards by proving that there was indeed a sizeable market for quality work if it was cleverly presented in an entertaining and accessible style in this book the veteran newspaper man draws upon his impressive array of observational and descriptive skills to create a striking collection of penetrating celebrity profiles alistair wrote with the deft light hand of a popular scribe but also with the probing incisiveness of a psychology professor at all times he examined the inner workings of his subjects with an almost clinical thoroughness and a commendable sense of fairness when it came to creating word pictures the man was an old master alistair cooke was a consummate journalist an all class act and a credit to his chosen calling 
excellent political thriller set in another solar system traviss s background as a journalist and familiarity with the military adds authority to this depiction of royal marines and other humans interacting with four different sapient races however this doesn t mean this is typical military sf there is tension but little violence at least by the humans also as a previous reviewer noted environmental issues are central to this series third in the series this book maintains the first two books uniformly high quality and continues the high drama of flawed individuals trying to do what s right while the series reportedly will continue in other books in this book it reaches a satisfying conclusion and while reading the first two would make it easier to follow the action traviss gives enough backstory so that a newcomer can pick up the thread 
simplified irrigation design this resource is excellent extreme detail great illustrations and information that is not provided by other typical irrigation books you ll find at home depot i m a landscape designer and highly recommend this resource

brilliant beginning but better stuff to follow at the time of its first appearance in between men was viewed as an important intervention into feminist as well as gay and lesbian studies it was an important book because it argued that sexuality and desire were not ahistorical phenomenon but carefully managed social constructs this insight that actually originated with michael foucault is often viewed as anti humanist or post humanist because it argues that men and women are simply the products of patriarchal power relations over which they have no control by mobilizing foucault s theories of the history of sexuality sedgwick re fashions feminism and gay and lesbian studies to make it seem as though feminism and gay and lesbian studies are ideally situated to continue those interventions into the history of sexuality begun by foucault sedgwick s own concern in this book is homosocality and this book s contribution to that topic is invaluable and still provides an excellent starting point for any foray into that topic her views on homosociality were groundbreaking however sedgwick s book is famous mainly for its introduction which critiques current research agendas including radical feminist agendas as well as spells out the research agendas that she feels gay and lesbian studies should pursue its a twenty page introduction that to this day remains the best synopsis of academic feminisms especially radical feminism as well as the best articulation to date of the need for a new kind of discipline that can make use of the best part of existing feminisms and continue to evolve gay and lesbian studies in productive directions in that twenty page introduction sedgwick lays out an academic template that has retroactively been labeled queer studies for that introduction this book deserves five stars the rest of the book is dedicated to new readings of classic eng lit texts and will only be of interest and of use to students of english literature overall the book is appealing because sedgwick draws a map that is in fact usable the pitfall of this book is that she uses this map to explain everything this is of course a charge that can be made against any theorist that believes that their new theory holds the secret to history to desire to sexuality to subjectivity to relationships of all kinds to every social situation and to every literary work its only later that we begin to see that any theory also has blind spots like foucault sedgwick treats masculinity and femininity and lesbian and homosexual not as natural and stable categories but as historically contingent and shifting categories this is fine so far as it goes but it also means that in order to challenge these categories and effect structural changes to the way we view gender and sexuality the academic must argue from some privileged position that allows them access to the ways society shapes its subjects and also allows some privileged insight into how historical change occurs again this is true of all theory an academic that suggests that we are all shaped by history must also realize that their own views are shaped by their own historical academicpersonal situatedness and to her credit sedgwick does just that in her later and much more interesting because much more self critical touching feeling in that book sedgwick evolves what amounts to a relational ethics as well as an ethics of academic life that recognizes that various forms of relationality and knowledges are practices that produce affects if between men is a book that makes big claims touching feeling is abook that analyzes the affects of such claims touching feeling is thus a book that concerns itself less with cracking the sex and gender codes of the past although she does some of that in this book as well than in thoughtfully analyzing how practices habits and beliefs affect the quality of our lives in many ways touching feeling marks a departure from some of her previous work and a return to a much more traditionally humanist approach a return that was foreshadowed by foucault s own return to ethics and humanism in his late work it would seem that sedgwick is saying that being fully human means not living in others codes and ideologies nor dedicating ones life to cracking those codes and or evolving new ones which is to perpetually postpone the living of one s own life in the present but living in critical relation to those codes and ideologies and evolving knowledge practices that are nourishing to one s self ones students friends and communities in between men it is obvious that sedgwick is not any ordinary academic that book was a brilliant beginning and in it we can see the habits and tendencies of mind that make all of her books unique and appealing touching feeling is the fully evolved realization of those habits and tendencies of mind and the book that i think she will be remembered for between men helped initiate one trend in academic life queer studies touching feeling is already shaping another trend in academic thought and one that i think will remain current for some time to come the ethics of relationality

wing to wing oar to oar gt this anthology on courting and marrying was very interesting and bolstering of many things i knew to be right and good the authors say that all the selections are not what they deem a single coherent traditional teaching on the subject but that they are offered quotin wisdom seeking rather than wisdom deliveringspirit as writings that make us think that challenge our unexamined opinions expand our symnpathies elevate our gaze and introduce us to possibilities open to human beings in everyday life that may be undreamt of in our philosophizing quot pg it was eye opening to trace the decline of courtship at the beginning of the th century and what the emergence of dating methods did to male and female relationships the authors see an increased failure of marriages not because courting isn t done the old fashioned way but because certain elements of what makes marriages work are no longer even considered largely elements that have become secondary in importance to the current all encompassing reason for marriage romantic love not to say that romantic love shouldn t be a factor but that it is not necessarily the greatest or only factor also included are reflections on the virtue of modesty the merit of waiting and the fulfillment of partnership and parenting a good resource and thought provoking book

reflecting on carville this book deserves a more intensive review than this but it also deserves to be read so i will at least share some random reflections on it carville is the name of a small community in south louisiana it is also a euphemism for the location of the hospital that for more than years treated patients with leprosy preferably called hansen s disease as such carville was a place of mystery and curiosity marcia gaudet s new book of recollections takes the mystery out of the place and shows it to be the home of an intensely courageous group of people stigmatized for their condition but never defeated the book which has much to offer to the scholar and the lay reader alike records the memories of trauma and grief that hansen s disease patients endured but the book does not stop with trauma it relates the formation and growth of a community with its own traditions escaping through the hole in the fence celebrations mardi gras and tall tales for anyone with even a casual interest in the lives of people in intensely painful situations the book is an inspiration and a must read

you too are called to communion called to communion understanding the church today starts off with three theology lectures for a course on universal vs particular churches for bishops in brazil followed by an address to the synod of bishops on the priesthood a talk on ecclesial reform to conclude an annual meeting in rimini and finally a homily preached at a seminary in philadelphia which is added to clarify once more the spiritual orientation of the whole book from the foreword all of these events took place in but the material is as relevant if not more so today the stated goal in the foreword of offering a sort of primer of catholic ecclesiology to bring clarity and help in the crisis of ecclesial consciousness is fulfilled in spades the nature of the book and the audiences it was directed toward originally does not allow cardinal ratzinger to go into the level of detail i would have like to have seen but nevertheless he is quite successful at giving the reader a good overview of catholic ecclesiology particularly as it relates to the roles of bishops priests and the nature of true reform in the church in the first chapter he establishes the origin of the church in jesus of course by using not only gospel testimony but also paul s doctrine of the church as the body of christ and the beginnings of church functioning in the acts of the apostles chapter two deals with petrine primacy and the unity of the church the author acknowledges the ecumenical difficulty of this question but goes on to solidly show the status of peter as rock as head of the twelve and as keeper of the keys which he deals with at the greatest length of the three points succession is one of the areas that would have been worth exploring more but his appeal to early christian writers irenaeus and eusebius is effective and he hits a home run with this observation it is impossible to avoid the idea of succession once the word is transmitted in scripture is considered to be a sphere open to the future p the next chapter gets to the heart of the theology lectures the universal and particular churches and the role of the bishop unsurprisingly the eucharist is seen as the heart of ecclesiology it is the unifying factor orthodox and protestant views are contrasted with each other and the catholic approach and the conclusion is reached that communio is catholic or it simply doesn t exist at all p the bishopric is traced back to peter james and paul and then as now the bishop is called to be a missionary of the whole church not just his local church and he must be ready to suffer as his lord did the essence of the priesthood is the topic of the fourth chapter this is a very full chapter he bemoans the fact that a new look back tried to justify the priesthood by looking at its biblical roots and deeming it a functional role only he provocatively states that this view was reached by reformation era arguments and exegesis largely nourished by reformation presuppositions but while cardinal ratzinger recognized that the ministries seemed ill defined in the early church he sees the foundation of ministerial office in apostleship jesus sent the apostles and gave them everything they had he conferred the mission and himself as mission apostolic succession is not treated in depth but he uses solid passages from acts peter and corinthians to stress the sacramental nature of bishops and priests he closes the chapter with some deeply moving reflections of a more spiritual nature a must read for all priests the last chapter deals with renewal of the church contrasting futile and authentic reform it is the best chapter in the book and one i d like to get in the hands of every catholic or anyone who wants to understand the pope s authentic view of reform and renewal a democratic church that so many long for will never work a church based on human resolutions becomes a merely human church it is reduced to the level of the makeable of the obvious of opinion opinions replace faith and in fact in the self made formulas of faith with which i am acquainted the meaning of the words i believe never signifies anything beyond we opine pp true reform is based on a full faith itself in the freedom that the lord offers which is our true freedom reform begins with each person through personal morality liberation from sin not guilt forgiveness imaging jesus and expiation purification through pain and suffering in communion with christ the epilogue continues the theme of the last chapter emphasizing the dangers of factional strife within the church instead calling us to be coworkers of god it is clear where he came up with his episcopal motto fellow worker in the truth this book is relatively short at pages but very rich it is worth getting for everyone who wants to understand the authentic mind of the church as enunciated by the current pontiff 
an invitation to mention god more often professor thomas long is well known as a major representative of christian faith he has served on the faculty of princeton theological seminary and is currently the bandy professor of preaching at candler school of theology emery university ever since the first time i heard him speak in his witness has blessed me so too in this book in which dr long addresses the importance of talking about what we believe about god jesus the holy spirit and the church he starts the book with a wry observation made by a new yorker at fashionable dinner parties in this town you can talk about anything but if you mention god more than once you probably won t be invited back page i have been to parties like that and perhaps you have as well where when people find out that you are a follower of jesus they glaze over say something like how nice for you and then drift away now aside from the fact that we might want to avoid such fashionable dinner parties in madcap manhattan what dr long is also saying to us christians of the world speak up and be heard and then he goes on to say how and why and what we might want to be talking about in matters of faith in everyday conversation i like that saying what we believe is a gift even an art the well chosen word can attract peek the interest engage encourage and convince the listener you have that ability as you go about your day to day routine your faith can lead others to christ and help them along life s narrow way but only if you will speak up dr long s book one of the top ten best selling religious books of is not a book about personal witness or evangelism so much as it is on telling the truth about who god is for us he says that how god has engaged our life is a story that just has to be told to our children in the midst of meetings when a friend has a bad medical diagnosis when people are disagreeing about school policies our the fence i the yard and yes even at a dinner party he also address the difference between a time to speak and a time to keep silence as we honor both god and the person god has put us with in the situation in which god has placed us my personal favorite portion of this book is on page when he says this it has been said that if we really knew how to see with the eyes of our souls we would see angels going before every person we meet saying make way for the image of god ! make way for the image of god we know from john that god loves us that much would that we would love one another as god loves us all so we could equally look at each person we meet and reminder ourselves jesus died for him jesus died for her dr long ends the book with a story that is the point of the entire book contained in it is the vital question if someone were to hear you speaking could they tell who you are could they tell that you are a child of god and a follower of jesus if you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture as well as religion and fiction 
great stories good points decent layout becoming a better negotiator is in everyone s best interest so when one of my students recommended power of nice i was pretty excited about ordering it from amazon and put it in the queue to read i really enjoyed the stories in this book shapiro has been there done that in some of the biggest and toughest negotiations in the sports world if you are a baseball fan it will bring back memories and i learned more from the stories than anything else i have read this book twice the first time it didn t quite click and i have a theory why the book s content is pretty good but the layout is terrible i just finished reading a book by addison wesley press that had at least times the number of facts per page and power of nice and as always the information was laid out professionally it helps me to absorb the material there is another thing that is off putting is how the author keeps saying if you follow the principles in this book you ll get better results and more of what you want and similar hey i already bought the book quite selling it reminded me of richard with his refuse to lose s principles in little miss sunshine another small problem and then i will start praising the book again they use a lot of initials for instance the three ps everyone who has ever read a business book knows the three ps are product price and positioning but not here the three ps in power of nice are prepare probe and propose however i just came out of a fairly intense negotiation i had read the entire book once and spent the days before the negotiation preparing i let the other side propose first i probed and i proposed it all worked so the book was certainly worth the i paid for it and much much more and i did get better results and more of what i wanted so shapiro has every write to claim that i have not read a better book on negotiation pick it up and deal with the layout already

a delightfully pessimistic survey randy clarke s book is a must have work for understanding libertarian accounts of free will at the very least it is quite helpful in giving an overview of many of the issues involved in developing a cogent indeterministic account many philosophers have thought that indeterminism is a hindrance for securing freedom and so clarke wants to find a view that secures such freedom any adequate account he thinks will be i comprehensible ii broadly logical iii will have a characterization of requirements such that fulfilling them entails that we are free and iv the location of indeterminism is not superfluous the structure of the book is as follows first he sets out some issues pertaining to incompatibilism and what an account of freedom must secure for example a satisfactory account of freedom will secure our making a difference in the world among other things this first chapter is in part about the different ways of construing the incompatibilist thesis and there are interesting implications for the rest of the book next he moves on to consider noncausal accounts ginet mccann concluding these are unsatisfactory clarke considers event causal views mele ekstrom dennett kane after concluding these views don t provide enough control he moves on to agent causal accounts while he contends that the most plausible account an integrated view which includes agent causation event causation can answer many of the typical objections he ultimately finds the libertarian project doubtful not obviously defeated because of problems pertaining to substance causation where an agent would be a substance and not an event ive skimmed over quite a bit of information and many of the interesting things he has to say much less what i think about the arguments let me just finish by noting that he largely assumes incompatibilism to be true if you buy the book looking for such arguments you will find very few second this is a difficult book regardless of your philosophical pedigree but having said that working carefully through this book has a nice return 
not just for the legal trade while i can easily see this book as assigned reading in every law school class for intellectual property it really deserves the greater readership of those who found joy in reading eats shoots and leaves its erudition is apparent but never pedantic the message of concern for our becoming a society that knows the price for everything but is not willing to share anything of value is woven skillfully into the fabric of its clever teachings and for those folks who like a nicely designed hardback book people who know things about fonts and book cover color this is a great book to own new the university of chicago has given ms bielstein the star treatment she is due

it will change you if you want to read a book about the arab israeli conflict in order reinforce your position this is not the one this book offers no solutions nor presents any new arguments in fact its poignant depiction of suffering on both sides will make you question any prior views you ve held and that s a very difficult choice for some people to make the prose is almost hypnotic transcending the dryness of most non fiction books there hasn t been a book like shipler s arab and jew in the last fifteen years this book was written before the first intifadah so some of the statistics are out of date and rhetoric has intensified i only wish shipler could update this great work

don t read it unless you want to ponder its meaning for quite some time this was an attempt to find meaning in life which so many authors and others have struggled with since we started walking on two feet is there any change from one generation to another or from one time to another or from one place to another camus believes not he doesn t see a moral advancement of humanity but a stagnant slog through what chance puts in front of us reading this book i had the feeling that i was going through the feelings of those poor souls in oran i was sharing with them first denial then anger then acceptance then resignation and finally joy if not joy then at least relief but the plague can come again on a whim i imagine that the novel is a statement of the uncertainties that we find ourselves in all the time and how little we can do about it there is no divine force guiding us or anyone else we have to find our own way whether it is through helping people or not helping people through what is considered legitimate or what is illegitimate actions there are no moral statements in the book just acceptance of the various forces acting upon us through us and by us this book through the various and opposing characters it paints trying to come to grips with this calamity accomplishes its aim be prepared to think about its meaning well after reading the last page think about its relevance whenever external forces overpower us as they do all the time whether natural or through the actions of mankind

this soldier s favorite book if you read one murder novel in the rest of your life read crime and punishment by fyodor dostoyevsky it s only pages but it speaks volumes i discovered dostoyevsky a few months ago while i was deployed to iraq and my literary world will never been the same i found a copy of the brothers karamazov in a pile of miscellenious books that had been dedicated to troops to boost morale and took it to a literary savvy lt col i knew when i showed him my find he insisted i read crime and punishment first i m certainly glad i decided to take his advice crime and punishment tells the story of a brutal murder in pre revolutionary russa and the emotional torment of the eccentric murderer raskolnikov the book is as dark and suspenseful as anything i ve ever read but it also manages to convey things on the opposite end of the emotional spectrum like redemption and love my favorite passage of the book a hard pick for sure is when porfiry a jovial but formitable detective interrogates raskolnikov the deployment is over but my infatuation with dostoyevsky s books has just begun i m now reading the idiot and enjoying it though it s too early to see if it matches crime and punishment whether you are deployed to the farthest reaches of the world or sitting comfortably at home crime and punishment promises to be an exhilerating read 
on the right frequency in the john grisham catalogue the street lawyer is viewed as one of his lesser works i am surprised as it impacts me the most and recently discovered why while watching frequency with dennis quaid i took note of the many possible plot holes that existed yet when reading a review of the movie by film critic roger ebert i was struck that he left these important issues to the side and focused on the heart of the film a father and son who almost supernaturally communicate across time to save the father s life and bring the two back together the film worked by keeping the father and son relationship in the forefront thus allowing ebert to remember his father the street lawyer works not only as a light reading page turner but also as a novel that focuses on the homeless and successfully keeps them in the forefront of all action that goes on lawyer michael brock owed to crisis leaves his salary and future at a prestigious law firm to dedicate his talents to fighting for the rights of the homeless in washington d c along the way we meet claire brock who will go the way of failed first marriages ruby a possible replacement mordecai the larger than life lawyer for the homeless who leads michael s new thread bare law firm and we get to know the homeless plight through visits to d c shelters conversations of poor municipal care and a well conceived plot involving an illegal ouster of rent paying squatters that causes well i won t spoil it for the new reader what is revealed almost between the lines is grisham s friendliness towards religion the homeless are often fed by sympathetic churches ruby is the daughter of a minister and the vice of greed is shown for what it is a selfishness that hurts others and is often confused as a virtue werent we just chasing money why did we work so hard to buy a richer rug and older desk most telling is brock s crisis experience when visiting the bodies of a homeless family in the morgue we read i closed my eyes and said a short prayer of mercy and forgiveness don t let it happen again the lord said to me pages of the paperback edition this line that his new work is a calling from god lifts the book to a new realm i recently talked to a lawyer friend of mine who teaches human rights has participated in human rights conferences around the world and has even counted votes with jimmy carter she said the non religious approach to human rights holds that human rights and respect are essential to maintain world and regional harmony yet this essential item is a construct rather than an absolute and falls away if one does not agree that harmony is essential that is one might place a personal political or religious viewpoint above harmony making it his or her absolute even if this involves killing michael s calling is an absolute if god did indeed say it then working to better the condition of the homeless results since people are made in his image an absolute that would even cause michael to leave it all and work for little to make their lives better that is not to say that the novel becomes christian far from it but the biblical worldview is there and this gives the book substance the street lawyer does have weaknesses its short chapters are designed to build sympathy for the homeless while painting less than flattering pictures of those who should be doing more ie anyone not homeless michael s last chapter romance with ruby almost seems tacked on a sort of end with something upbeat here chapter and certainly not all anti homeless legislation is republican as well my father was a gruff year police veteran who detested and i mean detested lawyers i don t think that sgt gasko when armed with a warrant to search michael s apartment would respond so previously to michael s threats but would have delighted in legally taking apart his apartment and enjoying a lawyer s ranting and raving at the same time i know my father would have loved that opportunity but the novel works by building on a biblical worldview where people do have merit keeping the homeless the main thing and giving me a hero whose exploits no matter how fictional awaken in me a desire to do something more for those whose voices society chooses not to hear 
sweet little gift book if you are looking for an arthistorical study on milagros go for the excellent little book by martha egan also available at amazon com the short pages introduction on the history of milagros in this book is based on the book by martha egan this colourful nicely presented book focuses on the role that making milagros could play in your own life i find it a bit new agey but not too much there are five chapters in this book each divided into three parts body mind spirit every chapter covers a part of our body the head knowing is wisdom the heart how we love the hand your hands connect you to others the foot your feet support your journey through life the mouth our words are as good as our deeds about half of its pages are filled with full page mexican style artwork small photographs of traditional milagros are scattered throughout the text in each chapter the author gives her view on the symbolical meaning a milagro depicting this specific body part could have its meaning for our body for our mind and for our spirit she illustrates this with anecdotes from mexican daily life the mouth chapter tells how a mother s offering mouth milagros to the virgin mary led to a cure of her son s deformed jaw yes it is after all a book on miracles the book ends with a chapter on how to make your own milagros another reviewer already expressed his or was it her anger at the simplicity of the author s suggestions cutting out a picture from a magazine and laminating it if you really would like to make your own milagros you will get enough ideas from the rest of the book i believe this chapter was added just for those of us who are convinced rightly so or not that they have no creative talents whatsoever so that even those among us who can barely hold a pair of scissors can make their own little miracle workers to sum it all up there is not very much substance here but it is a cheerful well meaning little book on how to find hope and comfort in small things and how to introduce some home made miracles into your life i liked it it will make a lovely gift for someone who could use some cheering up whether this will be a friend or yourself

a masterly work this is the first novel i have read of kazuo ishiguro and i could not resist sighing reading the beautiful prose the portrayal of the butler his detached restraint and attempts to be the epitome of dignity throughout his career while extraneous circumstances sway his ideals and the gradual overwhelming realization of the barrenness of his tenuous beliefs marked by the ultimate realization of a life wasted transform the novel into a mesmerizing psychoanalysis of man s feeble relationship between his self and what he projects amidst the ruins of a fading empire and ways of living hope still persists of a beautiful evening of life marvellous

a damning portrait of hillary unlike hell to pay and the truth about hillary two books about the former first lady and current senator tom kuiper s ive always been a yankees fan is not a book but merely a collection of quotes of course it is a very amusing entertaining and sometimes downright scary collection hillary clinton has always had a sort of icequeen aura about her and some fine i ll be honest all of what has been recorded in this book only enforces that same image what she s said in anger over her husband s affairs what she s said about anyone who disagrees with her on anything even what she has said that would classify as anti semitism has been collected by kuiper what really stated the case for this collection of quotes was the cover emblazoned with the title ive always been a yankees fan but just under those words was a photograph of clinton wearing a chicago cubs cap ! flip flop don t think too hard it is obvious that she said she was a yankees fan when she thought it would help her public image and said she was a cubs fan when she thought that would help her public image this is clearly the result of political motivation at times however ive always been a yankees fan can be long winded and repetitive especially with its use of pictures over and over i saw pictures of president clinton embracing monica lewinsky pictures of hillary s calculating glare even pictures of bill with a fat cigar protruding from his mouth also for someone to truly appreciate this collection of quotes he or she would be advised to read up on some of the events that took place during the clinton years not just the years of the clinton presidency mind you such as the whitewater scandal ive always been a yankees fan could possibly become the holy grail of anti clinton rhetoric a tool used to damage her prospects during the campaign for her admirers on the other hand circling the wagons in response to those who criticize her political talk would not be surprising in the least when bernard goldberg released his scathing people who are screwing up america and al franken is jack huberman wrote a response titled people who are really screwing america and bernard goldberg is only hardly original but i m sure someone out there will compile a response to this possibly a collection of quotes from a leading republican who may have high hopes for kuipers collection presents to the reader a cold image of the new york senator that is all the more damning frankly because it is entirely in hillary s own words 
funny moving a great memoir of jesse lee s life the book is both funny and moving but in the end it seems rushed and like she just wants to end the book all in all i would highly recomend this book

a must read now more than ever this book provides a scholarly view of the relationship between islam and the west devoid of the biases that would prevent a critical analysis of the situation fuller and lesser bring years of phenemonal experience at the cia and the state department i would account the previous reviewer s low rating of this book due to his own inability to reach the top level of these guys if you want to learn about the middle east then esposito fuller and glenn e robinson are the way to go 
very cute rhyming book my yearold son loves this book it has catchy rhymes that are silly and a lot of animal pictures it is one of his favorite books and one i love to read as i can put a lot of feeling into it this is one of karma wilson s funniest books and the illustrations are great 
fun and interesting but i got mixed results if the poor condition of the library copy is any indication even more top secret recipes is a very popular book todd wilbur has a number of books and it can be a little confusing sorting them out there are three top secret recipes books top secret recipes more top secret recipes this book and even more top secret recipes these books focus on what wilbur calls convenience foods that is most packaged sweets and fast food he also has a book top secret restaurant recipes in which he attempts to duplicate the foods of mostly casual dining restaurants like chili s and applebee s he also has a book solely on drinks wilbur explains in the introduction of more top secret recipes that these are not the actual recipes used by restaurants and he did not obtain them through bribery theft other illegal or illicit means he starts with the ingredient list on packages of food and modifies the relative amounts or with fast food tries to identify the ingredients by taste he admits that the real producers of these foods often use custom ingredients unavailable to the consumer and that the goal was to match the texture and flavor of the food and appearance is secondary so why try to clone commercially available food in both more top secret recipes and even more top secret recipes the author mentions availability some of the foods are regional and you may not get them where you live in the introduction to more top secret recipes he gives a list of reasons including low cost and curiosity i m not so sure about the cost argument since i have to sacrifice two boxes of macaroni and cheese to make half a box of cheese nips but the curiosity is what applied to me i just wanted to know can i really duplicate these commercial foods at home this book contains recipes a big increase over the of the previous book the recipes clone the likes of mcdonald s nabisco carl s jr and taco bell every recipe includes a history of the food item something alone which makes this book valuable and a dimensioned engineering graphic of the product even more top secret recipes includes an interesting introduction discussing the fast food industry and gives some tips on creating the clones the recipes make as much use as possible of premade food and mixes for example most candy bars are coated with melted chocolate chips so you will not find that you have to crush cocoa beans or perform any such low level task from this book so far i attempted to make girl scout thin mint cookies i am a girl scout after all really my wife signed me up it was a surprise to me too and nabisco cheese nips the thin mints turned out pretty good the flavor and texture were pretty close the only problem is that the chocolate was a little thick applying it to a desired thickness is difficult also the chocolate remained quite soft a little more experimentation with cookie thickness and baking time and temperature might make the centers a little more consistent too the cheese nips are made using the cheese packets from kraft macaroni and cheese cheese and macaroni they turned out crispy and although bright orange like the real thing before baking turned out grayish tan when done although crispy they weren t light and bubbly like the real thing but were more like crispy cookies they needed to be cheesier they tasted like the flour and shortening they weren t bad though and my wife liked them but they weren t much like cheese nips a lot of recipes would benefit from the use of rolling pin rings to establish uniform dough thickness i also had mixed results with the recipes from more top secret recipes you can read my amazingly similar review on that book for more details using this book was fun and informative i ve had mixed results using these books in short have fun but don t expect miracles with every recipe 
very good beginning for starters let me say that i very rarely write reviews for amazon however i feel like i needed to say something to offset some of the negative reviews everyone has a different opinion of what constitutes a good book but some reviewers seem to imply that the enjoyment of this book will be raised or lowered dependent upon your intelligence and or age i read fantasy for one reason to escape the realities of life i don t read fantasy in order to develop a new way of thinking it s a book ! the content has been written by an author with different experiences than mine she has made up a story so that i could wile away an afternoon and frequently most of a night lost in another world several reviewers have commented on a lack of morality stilted dialogue and or cardboard characters whether or not you agree with those statements will always be a personal matter i notice that most of the reviewers recommend that i try george r r martin because he apparently writes intelligent fantasy well i have tried to read grrm and couldn t bring myself to finish the violence was incredible horrificeven nightmarish and that was just the first part of the book ugh ! i know i know i am among the small minority that fervently wishes for less sex less violence and less language this book is surprisingly free of foul language has a minimal amount of violence that fits within the flow of the story and just enough romance to make your heart beat faster i hope that i have given you a reason to give this series a chance i will not compare this series to tolkien what can but i do not feel it is the drivel that others have implied i was a little apprehensive after reading some of the other reviews and i was pleasantly surprised to discover i enjoyed it now on to the rest of the series 
funny insightful story of growing older and wiser at age moonbeam dawson does not like the hippie name his mother gave him it says more about her than who he thinks he is at age and he decides he must change it and declare some independence he chooses reid hoping that will bring a little less unwanted drama into his life reid takes a step away from his warm single parent mother and begins to discover work girls heartache and loyalty we are enchanted with his journey whether we are or even more as reid makes peace with his mother the fact of his native american father and the quirkiness of his childhood he reminds us that our roots are as important as our wings and that growing up requires both with love 
totam tibi subdo me it is not there simply for appearing part here but rather to appear part there they do not jump the categories and they get where we go the dislocated paradigm appeared as if nobody had not taken a reading thus it is difficult to get our rolamentos so who thinks about the foundation of parents unless it is not excellent to its situation illumination beckons but it is not definitive and the infinitive certainly is not duplicated they try to adapt pieces in new matrices the not old ones to the arrest of the woman demonstrates they had had matrices at least once in their lives my matrices are grumosos grumoso was the friend of wally wally was an astronaut it s so easy to rhyme the name of extremity with hourra hourra for captain spaulding elephant pyjamas etc the i is moved away correcto she said as she put old pieces in new matrices dont mention the arrest of the woman or her sibling she cried she sees them in the spaces for new features but that is old wisdom they do not put the new wine in old old wine peels nor do they put the new wine in ivrognes whatever those are they get it perhaps do you do you think that the last lives are less complex or just that the matrix has more dimensions and the known pieces are identical hmmm do not imply more complexity in the experience until you have learned not to remember new pieces he is like a devil s food cake without the devil but pull rank in a fundente tunnel and you quickly see the defect of sonorous reproductions if you can read this you are too close to godhead 
a highly intriguing book first of all let me declare myself to be a jim lehrer fan his novel white widow forever carves a place for him in american literature lehrer adds to an impressive list of books with this latest mystery as usual his premise is very intriguing and he manages to deliver an enormous amount of franklin scholarship in a clear and breezy style not only does lehrer furnish us with a first rate mystery regarding the secret life of ben franklin he also addresses the more profound question what is historical truth and how can we ever really know it in an entertaining and deceptively sly book 
sim project review the good the sim project is a good tool for people who dont have any project experience whatsoever it moves the player through the process of resourcing a project what the cost or value of the various resources do to the outcome of the project and it allows the user see the outcome in the tool that is perhaps most widely used to track projects ms project the bad to use the book and the game there must be an instructor involved you can not purchase this book and expect to use it outside of a class setting the code that is used to access the site is good for only one simulation and once the simulation has begun you can not change the initial parameters to see how it would turn out using different decisions cost is another factor at for one round of play seems a bit much but remember that this is an academic text however the real item you are paying for is the code to access the site the book can be downloaded from the site and should be to get the most recent version overall good simulation good view of the project process brings people together to work the process gives students an understanding of real life scenarios without a professor having to manufacture the materials 
excellent star wars ok so the book starts out a little slow but i must say that is because the book is written from the first person stand point the only starwars book i know of to be written from that perspective this story follows corran horn from stockpole s xwing series on his journey to become a jedi knight corran s wife mirax is missing and in order to find her he must come to terms with his heritage so he changes his name to keiran halycon and joins luke skywalker s jedi academy as one of his first students the story goes right along with the jedi academy trilogy and then precedes after exar kun s defeat to corran leaving the academy for his own reasons he doesnt like how luke runs the academy it doesnt work for him to continue his search for his wife but in order to save her he must make a choice join the dark side or lose her forever you will have to read the book to find out what happens there but if you know anything at all about star wars you know everything usually works out in the end 
awesome story that tugs at your heart this is the best book that i have read in years ! though an emotional book to read it takes you through the love story of the author and her husband at the same time as it takes you through the terror and grief of losing him on it brings home the heart of the losses of all from that day that should never be forgotten i laughed at the same time i cried my eyes out having to stop reading many times as i could no longer see the words through my tears it makes you want to just hold her while she grieves makes you want to do anything to make it better for her also the unsung hero of this story the story of the love between her and her sister who is a rock for her through this whole trying time she is an unbelievably gifted writer that touches every corner of your heart i would recommend this book to anyone i will re read this book again just because it was so beautiful you feel like a part of her life when you are done reading it you want to be part of her life it is the best book i have read in a very very long time probably ever 
awesome book i purchased this book recently i have been following the recipes almost on the daily basis kwality s quality ke cholay and nani s kulfi are exceptionally good they both take me back in a very nostalgic mood the taste was heavenly i feel it was very generous of mr saran to share his nani s grandmas kulfi recipe which not only tastes delicious but also can be made in a jiffy ! we also loved green beans prawns balchow lemon rice daal tandoori prawns manglore shrimp lahori chicken to name a few i encourage you to try the recipes just as they have been written they will come out great next time you can add or decrease the spices based on your individual taste i assure you each recipe will come out very flavorful i also liked the trick for making paneer indian cheese at home using ricotta cheese the book is full of taste delicacies memories and emotions it s an awesome book and i am very glad that i have it 
a nice light de lint yarrow is one of his less complex stories but that doesn t make it any less enjoyable the idea of an author being able to tap into an quototherworldquot to gain story material is a notion i really wish were true 
hi tech schmi tech i m in investment banking and i use it there is nothing more difficult or sensitive in my business than decision making the chapter on the quotdecision tree quot alone has made me a few million dollars i would say that s a pretty good deal and it had nothing to do with high technology 
solid study material this book is broken down nicely and tailored very well to the exam i have used numerous textbooks and study material in my quest to obtain my various certifications but this one was definitely the best it is well organized and easy to read the chapter end questions are decent and resemble those on the actual exam

a beautiful and brave novel michael ignatieff s novel is written from the perspective of a son who has a mother with a family with a history of dementia the title reflects the fact that scan of the brain shows scar tissue and this is how her condition is first diagnoised the son the protagonist is a philosophy professor who has successfully started a life of his own complete with a very satisfying career and a family of his own the novel captures the story of his mother father and his brother and their experiences in dealing with the mother s diagnosis of premature senile dementia and the progression of her condition this book won the mind book of the year allen lane award an annual uk award given to a fiction nonfiction book about mental health and was short listed for the booker prize the writing is astounding and as a result i was unprepared for the author s ability to describe the emotional journey of the protagonist i found myself haunted by the themes and subject matter in the same way that someone passing by a car wreck can t help but stop to stare ignatieff examines what dementia does to the identity of the sufferer and he references the de kooning the famous american painter who developed alzheimer s disease and yet continued to paint he also examines what dementia does to his own identity as he find himself trying to figure out who he is when his own mother no longer recognizes him as her son this book is a great achievement and will especially appeal to those readers who are seeking a book about illness and the philosophies related to illness and identity 
but if we do want to invade poland i gave this book one star before what it said appalled me and it still does but after reading it i scanned it once more as much as i hate to say it if you want to invade poland accomplish something great make your thumbprint on the world you will need this book it s the best for this purpose but this leaves out about of the population and probably you and me this is really a quotcommanders guide to organization quot so for of the population i still give it one star for that of the population who want to climb mount everest or help cure world hunger i give it five stars good luck 
walkenbach is the best just an echo of previous reviewers this is my third or fourth walkenback excel book and they are all excellent he provides more not obvious tips and tricks than any other author that truly impact the efficiency and usability of your spreadsheets great reference 
a good book for beginners but mediocre for more advanced readers most of the things that cassandra eason describes are in fact a lot easier than they seem from the book psychic development is a personal discovery of one s own natural abilities thus it is unfortunate that certain things and the techniques that the author talks about are simply not true or incomplete in her defence however it has to be said that a lot of these abilities such as clairvoyance or astral travel etc are techniques that are very difficult to describe i would say that about of the techniques outlined in this book could work whereas the remaining are nonsense for someone who already has certain psychic abilities that he or she is aware of this book will probably be a disappointment you d be better off looking for something more specific however for most people who are yet unaware of their abilities or who are just interested in what is possible this book will be very good as the general outline is excellent further this book provides some very good examples of what is possible within us this book should be awarded stars out of five since it is generally very good but fails to deliver some consistent information it is a very good book for beginners thoug 
john rhodes a time of civility in congress full disclure i ve met j brian smith author of john rhodes man of the house a number of times both professionally and personally he is not aware i m writing this review nor alas has money changed hands to influence my opinion why read a book about former congressman john j rhodes r arizona why write such a book for political junkies this book is an insider s look at the workings of the government at critical moments in the late th century from vietnam to watergate to the opening of relations with china and through the changes in congress that senator orrin hatch r ut once described as this has gotten so vicious that i have to admit it s the worst i ve seen in twenty seven years in the senate rhodes served in the house of representatives from to on december when gerald ford was named vp to replace spiro agnew rhodes was unanimously elected house minority leader smith was rhodes s press secretary and a good friend from until the congressman s death in and kept a daily record of what went on during those years what emerges is from careful notes not memories dimmed by time what makes this book important for all americans is realize that the bitter partisan vituperative nastiness described by hatch above isn t the way it has to be what a difference a generation makes when rhodes was minority leader he often butted heads with house speaker thomas tip o neill jr d ma o neill remembers john and i have had our squabbles along the line but i don t think thre are any two people closer even though we re miles apart in our philsophy hes just a beautiful fella smith is a natural story teller he didn t try to write the definitive page biography but rather provides a rare insider s look at defining moments in late th century political history as seen from one of the lesser known but more powerful influencials involved the section on the challenges rhodes faced with the nixon watergate scandal is particularly fascinating revealing again how different were republican and democratic members of congress just years ago two themes dominate the book john j rhodes was a rare breed of american politician he wasn t flashy he was not charismatic he didn t draw attention to himself through his words actions attire or mannerisms he kept his ego in check and yet at the same time he was a man of the house understanding and using the arcane rules of procedure with skill and fairness smith isn t trying to nominate rhodes for sainthood the congressman s temper his poor oratorical style his political maneuverings and his keen political ability to count votes and manipulate the system to his advantage are given equal time but on balance rhodes comes across as a man of honor and integrity smith quotes sam donaldson we in the press liked him because he understood our job he didn t always agree with what we wrote or said but he never held a grudge and the welcome mat was always out for reporters he would have made a great president today there are too few in public life like him which introduces the second theme rhodes was in office when members of congress treated one another with a level of comity rarely seen today there were differences of course some were based on issues others on personalities in general however the atmosphere was civil such courtesies were sincere and personal grudge matches rare today they are the norm interestingly smith is surprising blunt putting much of the reason for the change onto newt gingrich r ga although he doesn t go into great detail while he gives gingrich credit for much of the republican party s congressional resurrgence he also writes that his didactic combative take no prisoners approach hurt people along the way gingrich s takes the lion s share of the blame for the bitterness partisanship and personal antagonism that still characterizes much of washington smith has the knack of making interesting some of the more complex and mind numbing ways in which the house works he has a message to promote and a story to tell and he s found the right balance and tone to convey both a very readable well written book john rhodes man of the house is worth the time for those frustrated with the character of so many politicians today and who wonder if it ever was any different

a little rough around the edges but it s a great start i caught the tail end of one of ron s interviews on tv and just had to buy the book those donuts on the cover look so good yum p actually i ve dealt a little bit with this disorder myself but only late at night i have read before that there is something like a nighttime or evening eating disorder but i m not sure how scientific that is anyway i thought the book was better when he was writing about his childhood as it seemed to feel increasingly rushed and excessive with the bad language as it neared the end my absolute favorite part was about what happened with the ocs and i laughed my ss off at that and then later the metaphor hit me and i wondered how ron could have overlooked that irony in fact i m still wondering maybe it s in the book and it was i who overlooked it i sure got a shock of nostalgia running into the mention of the worldwide church of god i haven t heard of them since the s and i would love to know how they survived their silly doomsday prophecies i would definitely buy ron s second book i think he s a riot and has real potential next time just don t try to finish the end of the book in one huge gulp ok

americans at the court of the dalai lama lost in tibet is a rare kind of book that gives more than it promises it deals with an apparently remote and forgotten or better not renowned episode of wwii during a flight on the hump the airway help provided by the usa to china an aircraft carrying five not well acquainted militaries gets lost in a storm and crashes in a remote tibetan valley with great difficulties and much suffering the five survive and are conducted to lhasa in lhasa was exactly how we see it in harrer s seven years in tibet a forbidden and xenophobic city where only englishmen and chinese were accepted and tolerated making exception only for harrer and aufschneider which were austrians the arrival of the americans is widely misinterpreted by the touchy tibetans fearfull of chinese invasion and they are object of a diplomatic upheaval they are guests first of the chinese and finally of the british delegation after a long permanence the finally receive the permission to leave lhasa and undertake a terrible journey back to india in the tibetan winter on snowridden passes the interest of the book lies naturally in the story which for me was completely unknown but expecially in how the authors make all the possibile connections with history and crossreference the whole episode to contemporary documents and successive interviews with the protagonists and their acquaintaces we learn of the quality and entity of airway traffic on the hump together with political problems of tibet in those years before chinese occupation we meet interesting people such as the chinese kung and the englishman george sheriff and his wife betty with their love for himalayan flora we understand the geography of the tibetan plateau rivers the book is deeply researched and a great amount of work lies behind its fast snappy prose the journalistic cut is evident and the most information is passed in the least number of words at moments i had the impression of a tv special excellent and instructive read 
another pilot s thoughts running into the sky was both very informative about the technical and practical aspects of learning to fly powered paragliders as well as being a very entertaining saga the author has a great sense of humor which is mixed in good proportion with valuable information anyone who flys or dreams of flying a ram air wing powered or non should give this a read

i chose this book as a required reading for my seminar i like this book because it is very interesting and informative i began reading it for pleasure but by the time i was half way finished i was sure of its serious nature and had decided to adopt it as a required reading in the seminar that i teach on the economic impact of globalization the author succeeds in presenting the right mix of theory and history with sufficient analysis it is well researched and very well organized it should prove as interesting to the general reader as it is informative for the academics however its treatment of classical economists is far superior to the section dealing with contemporary writeres on free trade hopefully in the second edition the author will remedy this shortcomeing 
great book this is a great book if one is interested in learning more about the world of lbo s and the dealings of wall street if you read den of thieves and liked that one you ll definitely love this one 
gazing into the mind s i four centuries ago rene descartes opined i think therefore i am in this one five word sentence he reduced all provable human phenomenon to the contours of one s imagination in this book dan dennett of tufts university suggests that human awareness does not even extend to the limited contours proposed by descartes instead of what he calls cartesian theatre dennett suggests that human cognition is nothing less than the accumulated evolutionary behavioral detritus of the millenia in other words we are not conscious sentient beings but rather the resultant zombies of evolution sometimes fleeing sometimes fighting sometimes feeding sometimes mating but always in response to evolutionary imperative and never the result of anything more than the illusion of consciousness in its own way this book throws down the gauntlet to contemporary arrogance in much the same way darwin did and einstein did and godel did challenging easily held preconceptions and pointing us toward new inquiries and a new synthesis of reality those holding that dennett is facile haven t actually read him those considering him repetitious or irrelevant haven t understood him but interestingly enough those disagreeing with him may nonetheless still be right 
great source to teach kids to crochet i used this book to teach my class to crochet last year it does only cover single crocet stiches and increasing and decreasing but that is enough to introuce kids to this craft and give them a few projects to work on my class loved making the striped mufflers we got a lot of partial skiens of yarn donated and this worked perfect to make the mufflers with everyone s was unique and the kids boys and girls alike enjoyed wearing something they had made 
superb mordant brilliant one of the best books written not only is tacitus one of the sharpest narrative historians who has ever lived not only are we incredibly fortunate to have this poignant account of his view of history but we have michael grant s accurate and superb translation i can t imagine anyone not thinking this is a superb edition the bloke who compared it negatively with gibbon although i of course respect his opinion might try comparing it instead to herodotus sallust xenophon polybius livy suetonius josephus and philo as they are a little closer to tacitus era this is a major intellectual work by a marvelous writer of the first century ad who lived through some interesting times and had an opinion of course he is quotbiasedquot in other words he has an opinion who isn t everyone should know by that the historian s bias is one of the first things to look at tacitus was a conservative who pined for the golden days of a senatorial republic that he never knew of course he hated tiberius and reserved much of his best invective against him this may be the first non hagiographic biographical portrait of such fulness that was ever written or at least that survived and is incredibly valuable just for that i don t think i need to defend tacitus much more from anyone who gave him or who gave this edition less than a five star rating you don t like m grant s translation then learn to read latin fellows if you work hard you ll be able to read tacitus in one year but i shall say this tacitus is like homer and aeschylus in the sense that if you think they are boring it is because you have the problem not them 
best reference on seed starting this is a great reference book for gardeners who are interested in starting plants from seed rather than buying the same old stuff from their local garden centers each year this best thing about this book is that it rates each plant on its degree of difficulty when it comes to growing that plant from seed unlike the seed catalogs which imply that all plants are easy to grow from seed this book breaks it down into detailed instructions as to how to get the seeds to germinate and what conditions they require once germination takes place it is a great reference when browsing through the seed catalogs as to which plants are worth trying to start from seed and those whose needs may be way too much time money or environmentally demanding to even bother with 
not just the content whats great about this book is not just the content about which all other reviews have been raving anyway but its paper spiral binding and hard cover the glossy paper makes it readable even if you shine a low energy red light on it the spiral binding allows you to flip thru the pages easily while you hold the book folded in degrees and the hard bound cover enables you to hold the book with one hand over your head while you shine the torch on the book with other hand and gaze at the stars above

important social perspective told with a classic beat style ellison addresses an important topic with a free flowing beat style that puts the harsh realities of segregated america into poignant prose from its starting point where the reader may think this is the real stuff this is the uglier side of american history as told by a man who lived it the narrative has one early surreal interlude runs into a realist storyline for a good clip then hits the reader again with extended riffs of vivid metaphor later on invisible man is an important read as much for appreciation of ellis s style as for the socially relevant subject matter id recommend this book to readers interested in the u s social history and the civil rights movement and to those who enjoy the beat style prose that took shape in the early s id imagine jack kerouac fans would also enjoy ellison 
challenges of maturity perfect world is a riveting fiction novel that tells about the challenges of adjusting to high school and becoming moremature author brian james speaks from a fourteen or fifteen year old girls point of view the book is set in a town that has perfectly planned out houses and evenly spaced trees everyone in town thinks they are perfect and they do not talk about problems the main character lacie johnson has many family issues though her father committed suicide two years earlier in their bathroom her mother works two jobs and lacie is forced to stay home to babysit her younger brother malky lacie s best friend has always been a girl named jenna things have changed and jenna is more interested in boys and being socially accepted lacie is not as concerned about those things jenna meets a boy named avery and he introduces her to a boy named benji but as lacie and benji become closer lacie and jenna start to grow apart lacie struggles to see the good in the world and feels like she is loosing everyone close to her she starts to feel like she is going crazy just like her father the book is written differently than most books the sentence structure differs instead of using periods the author connects similar thoughts with varying amounts of periods they are similar to ellipses for example a paragraph with about fourteen lines of text has only a single period this book is also for an audience either about to enter high school or just recently started high school the issues are better suited for them some parts of the book contain sexual acts butnothing sexually explicit the most interesting part of book is how the author is a man and yet he tells the story from a teenage girl s point of view brian james treats the subject of fitting into high school and finding out who you are as a serious issue as i read the book i also found it hard to put down it keeps the reader interested in what will happen next it shows how the world we live in may not be so perfect at all you have to look inside yourself to find out what a perfect world is to you and strive to get there given the circumstances that are handed to you reviewed by kathleen o reilly for flamingnet book reviews for more preteen teen and young adult book recommendations and reviews please visit www flamingnetcom

more than a translation oedipus the king is one of the classic works of western literature it was originally written as a play in around bc by sophocles bc a greek philosopher and playwright it took the greek world by storm and has been handed down to future generations who have also been greatly influenced by it most notably in modern times sigmund freud took this work as pointing toward a deep rooted psychosis the oedipus complex oedipus the king also known as oedipus rex or oedipus tyrannus is the story of oedipus the king of thebes which is suffering under a horrific plague finding out that the god apollo has laid the plague on the city until it should punish the murderer of its previous king oedipus pronounces a curse on the murderer and sets out to discover who the murderer was sadly for oedipus there is fate upon fate wrapped up in this mystery and doom upon doom this book is not merely a translation of oedipus the king instead it is an acting version created by the stratford shakespearian festival company of canada for high school level students the book begins with an introduction to sophocles and greek theatre and after the play are copious notes critical excerpts and questions for discussion the play itself was written so that a young reader with no background understanding of greek theatre or culture will understand it overall i found this to be a great book i enjoyed the information about the play a lot and believe that it will be very helpful to any reader but foremost i enjoyed the play itself the story is powerful and quite enthralling i have never seen this play acted out but do think that this translation would make it excellent i loved this book and highly recommend it 
nobody knows it all this book is a great manual for learning how extend the use of your brain it s really comical when someone like magellan tries to serve up their theories on the rest of us as if they are some genius like darwin magellen doesn t know what he s talking about any rational scientist in this day and age will tell you that they are still studying and finding things about the brain that was not known on a daily basis and everyone s brain is unique to them so it s impossible for scientists to lump everybody in one category as magellan did the real answer is that they simply do not know what our brain s potential is and magellan is also wrong about our brains not generating electrical energy that was proven years ago that why our brains give electrical impulses that can be read on machines i know far too many people from all over the planet who have learned to do some amazing things with their brains the only thing that magellan shows to me is that he has no experience is this area and has no idea that these things are an every day reality for some people in every walk of life it s totally ridiculous for someone like magellan to try and dictate what reality is for everyone else magellan if you have yet to experience any of these things in the book that s your problem but you don t get to invalidate my experiences because you didn t have them for everyone else check the book out and get the validation from your own experience 
complete herbal this is the best book i could find and read concerning the herbal concoctions on the market today but make sure you get this book not one of the many so named green books there are many books out on this subject and some are very very similarily named this book has almost all of the herbs listed and uses for them i highly recommend it to herbal health persons 
a great follow up to undaunted courage his theme is that lewis amp clark accomplished what all the other explorers could not determining whether there was an easy water based passage across north america like stephen ambrose de voto was a huge fan of l ampc the whole course of empire leads up to the l ampc expedition it really helps to put the expedition in historical perspective more than that it puts the early history of north america in persective no small task because de voto cares about the explorers he describes it s full of great stories writing in the early s he did not have to worry about being politically correct but the facts speak for themselves a big book and worth the effort no problem for readers of undaunted courage i was sorry to reach the last page

a monument to my genius words cannot describe the impact this weighty volume has had on me from the moment i held it in my trembling hands i was hooked the rich carefully crafted prose is a delight to the eye and the imagination its author is undoubtedly a man of breath taking vision who has reconstructed the th century past with unique skills of research and analysis his character shines through in every page and the reader cannot help but conjure up in his or her mind a dazzling image of a dark tall handsome curator with beautifully slick and greased black hair a whiff of moustache and sparkling gold rimmed glasses every inch a man of learning i could go on and i will 
excellent book on ajax design strategies this is an excellent theory and strategy book for ajax for the uninitiated ajax stands for asynchronous javascript and xml in short it s the technology behind web new data is fetched from the server and or presented dynamically through client side javascript that calls server side sources commonly xml instead of refreshing the entire page individual elements are changed based on user input and new data pulled from the server the level of interaction and sophistication involved in using ajax makes it a force to be reckoned with because of that it s essential to have a book that covers the underpinnings of this technology true to the title of this book it is packed with good theoretical discussions of how ajax works and good strategies for how to use ajax knowing all of the tricks isn t worth much unless you can apply your knowledge in a meaningful way an example of what i considered impressive was the material on caching strategies ajax has always struck me as being a high transfer way to presenting information and instead this section makes ajax into a means of saving traffic unlike other books on ajax this book covers design patterns for the technology how do you divide data for distribution answer use the content chunking patterns how do you effectively maintain state or at least the impression of maintenance answer the persistent communications pattern how do you make all of the potential data available at the user s fingertips answer the infinite data pattern in the nine patterns presented the author explores much of theory and that helps you strategize when it comes time to code your own applications each pattern has a dedicated chapter that first presents the intent of the pattern then the motivation for using it in the context of ajax a list of possible applications of the design pattern and associated design patterns next the design pattern s architecture is explained in the context of solving an actual problem finally the implementation is shown via code and the user s interaction with various webpages at the end of each pattern s chapter there are highlights of what has just been presented up to now concrete examples of using ajax were copious and usable theory has been hard to come by making this book a welcome volume i know how to write javascript i know what xml is what i needed to know was how to bring it all together using design patterns that make sense for ajax this book accomplished that my one criticism is that the introductory material in chapters one and two seems a bit rushed so absolute beginners might benefit by reading head rush ajax first which is an excellent yet more introductory text i notice that amazon does not show the table of contents so i do that here chapter introduction to ajax chapter the nuts and bolts of ajax chapter content chunking pattern chapter cache controller pattern chapter permutations pattern chapter decoupled navigation pattern chapter representation morphing pattern chapter persistent communications pattern chapter state navigation pattern chapter infinite data pattern chapter rest based model view controller pattern 
short and sweet review this is a great book i was given it in a pile and recently picked it up and then could not put it down great characters detail and story my wife stayed up until in the morning to finish it read this book if you get a chance 
the hidden history of christianity norman cohn s history of the zoroastrian idea is one of the most informative and useful studies of a complex subject available the influence of zorastrianism on the emergence of monotheism should be common knowledge yet seems to escape public attention in its exclusive focus on the judaeo christian tradition highly recommended for students of religion and or of world history 
foot first heart in the end one person can make a difference that s the big lesson jenna boller learns outside of the classroom and it changes her forever as she returns to school in the fall she immediately realizes how much she has matured over the summer it s as if the other students were frozen in time jenna grew up at gladstone shoes at first she is consumed in her own problems most notably fixing the strained relationship with a dysfunctional alcoholic parent she helped put in jail a sister obsessed with her own appearance is also scarred by family problems but refuses to deal with them at work jenna s boss an elderly women mrs gladstone seems out of touch and too gullible giving the wrong people like the troubled tanner a second chance as jenna learns it was all a matter of having the right person redirect tanner s high energy in a more positive direction and mrs gladstone make jenna his boss partly responsible for the transformation mrs gladstone knows that in her heart jenna does not understand her methods jenna believes mrs gladstone is soft an easy mark as the story unfolds jenna observes as mrs gladstone takes on her own son exposing the corruption that has infested gladstone s new corporate offices as her mentor mrs gladstone explains i want you to learn from this i want you to write it in your heart in the end jenna intuitively creates her own mentoring role helping someone else put the best foot forward joan bauer has written a most enjoyable uplifting book that will not only resonate with young reasons but with all who read it it kept me smiling 
fascinating provocative evocative i knew nothing of freemasonry before reading this book i can t even remember what prompted me to read it in the first place but no matter because it is a fascinating piece of archaeological mystery writing the authors seek to discover the origin of masonic ritual and along the way the reader learns about the birth of middle eastern civilization with the sumerians the nature of king making in ancient egypt the origin of the jewish people a very alternative and provocative description of the nature of jesus s ministry and the construction of what has become christianity by the earliest roman christians this book does not seem to be meant to promote freemasonry so you won t be pummeled with masonic text the function of the masonic text and ritual in this book is to tie together aspects of mid eastern history and archaeology and relevant portions of celtic british isles history in a unique way 
good read gingrich and fortschen have written an excellent conclusion to their alternative history of the civil war as i stated in my review of the first book those of us who grew up in the south have lived with the what if questions our whole life the first volume of this series posits a confederate victory in the gettysburg campaign but even with that victory could the confederacy have pushed the campaign to victory and what would have been required to acheive that victory the authors have done an excellent job of taking into account the difficulty of capturing washington and the overwhelming superiority of men and material the federal forces had to win this war it would have required a quick knockout after july this book shows why this would have been difficult the difficulties in controlling a captive population sabotage internal weakness of the confederate government all are taken into account in this book i think the embrace of colored troops and the army of workers is probably a stretch the book involves a short period around on final conclusive battle in maryland not far from the site of the battle of sharpsburg the carnage is overwhelming but in comparison to cold harbor it seems feasible the authors show an excellent knowledge of the area the battle is fought on i enjoyed the trilogy it was fun fiction but it also helps the reader to address the what if s recommend

a true master of realism balzac s wit and and talent is simply unsurpassable ! as lucien is manipulated by the rich aristocrats to the point of self distraction in order to pursue his talents in poetry we learn the price of fame and status and condemn the aristocratic society where can be a fine line between pleasure and pain balzac s theme like mythology on the confilcs of high and low society is never aging

the best work of wells the martians have arrived let the war begin a catchphrase that could easily be employed for herbert george wells s most acclaimed science fiction the war of the worlds this is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on mars composed in a first person narrative the war of the worlds is a gripping saga of the millions of people s agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good the story begins directly with the theme in the last years of the th centuryin the most unassuming and delicate of all propositions england witnesses the most surreal threat ten bizzare cylinders all containing martians fall near london a wave of bitter agony nameless fear and hopeless apprehension rocks the peole and as the martians gradually come to terms with the earth s gravitational strength the police and the military of surrounding regions stolidly enarm themselves for an imminent war the greatest of all human fallacies is perhaps the absurd universal acknowledgement that humans are the most accomplished creatures anywhere this myth is firmly exploited in the book a the narrator an ardent follower of astronomy and scholar of philosophy perceives a plethora of harrowing incidents that compel him to shudder to his boots the narrator s town of maybury is completely demolished and so are the nearby towns of woking weybridgeshepperton and others the narrator manages to traffic his wife to his cousin s place in leatherhead in asumed safety but himself gets entangled hopelessly and helplessly in the boughs of life and death in his maddening and desperate escape from the clutches of the more intelligent and powerful martians the narrator pairs up first with an artillerman and then with a curate the latter is a lost soul whose faith in god and religion has broken in the wake of humanity s greatest ever calamity and the former is confident and visonery whose preferred modes of survival in a martian dominated earth is not that improbable if at all naive h gwellss artistry lies in speedily building up to a great climax and in a plot so utterly novel and unique and symmetrical this is a marvellous diusplay of wit intelligence and clearness of structure the war of the worlds on one level may appear to be a mere science fiction with vivid illustration of beings from outer space and the havoc they cause on our planet but the essence of the book transcends much beyond this demarcation the weahness of mankind in the face of unknown unheard and unthought catatrophes is firmly delineated in this landmark novel and wells applies a very very subtle satire on humans grotesque complacency on teir own abilities when the artilleryman admits were down were beat with absolute conviction the reader fathoms the author s surrender of the greatest power in the world to fate on a much higher level the war of the worlds is a massive comment on man s petty as well as magnanimous follies garbed in a dress of science fiction composed in a sense of retrospection the book does lose some of its charm from the very beginning that the narrator is alive and kicking and the confinement of the sequence of events within a relatively small england territory narrows the scope of the novel and also trims down its volume but even so the war of the worlds is a brilliant science fictin that leads the rteader on a journey on the back of an unfaithful wave that conpires to lead the world to the ultimate diasaster h gwells was a great visonery in the late th century and it s no less remarkable achievement that this englishman s great book is still being studied today and would be read for several decades to come the war of the worlds is a captivating and telling tale that would dazzle the reader by the shine of the writer s craftmanship

halleluiah thank god for dennis lehane if you haven t read lehane s illuminated manuscripts then stop what you re doing afer you finish this put your mouse down and click on buy because you will not be sorry lehane is all i ever wanted in a writer and boy do i want a lot ! so if you want everything and more in a mystery then lehane is the one just be ready because he will blow your mind isnt that what his name means in french a massive explosion high in the air how appropriate this guy is no faker dennis is a gift from the gods er wait he is a god he certainly is tuned into frequencies we mortals cannot see thank god for dennis lehane one caveat with this book dl writes tough provocative fiction that makes me dizzy with questions sometimes because the stories are so thought provoking especially the short stories even thought this specific book is a series detective novel it is definitely not for the timid if you re an average romance reader you should look elsewhere because gone baby gone deals realistically with some seriously offensive subject matter the abduction of children the way lehane breathes life into his stories lifts the characters up off the page for the reader and creates a complete atmosphere in a book it s easy to believe this stuff as real and it is pretty awful so be forewarned about the bad stuff my husband says this book still haunts him but he also says lehane is probably the best crime fiction writer working today on this dh and i wholeheartedly agree

how is it possible how is it possible that after decades of writing vintage mysteries like dark assassin a novel the great anne perry manages to make each more recent addition to her series in this case william monk novels fresh alive and impossible to put down one would think that by now we ve got william and hester along with all the rest of her characters so down that these books would be excellent venues to substitute for sleeping aides to the chronic insomniac ! but no ms perry will simply not allow it thank god buy this book and all the rest she is a keeper 
entertaining but beware this advice this book was like madonna s famous photographic book of when it hit the shelves in the s this is brown s manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era reader beware choices and actions have consequence and ponder very carefully before being cosmopolitan long after the expiration date living it up does not mean reckless behavior values are personal but when one woman s values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another ie affairs with married men it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others heads people are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them although now dated and updated with sex and the city ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right helen gurley brown has done alot of good for women pursuing careers enjouing the single life and having an identity but too much too long has a cost do you really want to be like brown and her counterpart hefner years old and taking hormones in some attempt at youth

a classic of worship and devotion as an evangelical who has recently come home to the historical liturgical church this book has truly been a gift from god it has opened up my personal devotions and bible study in deeper and more meaningful ways then i ever imagined we use this for worship at the church i attend and it is awe inspiring to realize my worship and prayers are risen to god using the same words and liturgy as those believers decades and centuries before i would recommend any evangelical who struggles with the shifting modern trends of the american church and having the center of prayer and worship being their personal feelings to explore the church of history one holy catholic and apostolic explore the catholic orthodox or traditional anglican churches and discover that the history of christianity did not begin at your conversion the founding of america or even the reformation this jewel of the anglican communion is with the king james bible the english speaking peoples greatest gift to the church and is a great place to start a journey away from church as defined by contemperary culture to one defined by history the church fathers the apostles and christ himself 
a favorite for pre schoolers in the jamberry tradition engaging art work rhythmic sounds and a strong beat make this a winner in the pre schooler crowd the style is comparable to jamberry or perhaps even chicka chicka boom boom a chance for your child to delve into interesting sounds and rhythms as they become aware of the richness of their language yes it s kind of silly 
better than the left behind series this series is great the first book and the second europa conspiracy is awesome it is a religous indiana jones and is action packed i would highly recommend this book and series 
mcelligot s pool i think this book is very good because it shows all the posibilaties that you can find in mcelligot s pool from a short fish to a fish that is many times as big as a whale that it makes a whale look like a tiny sardine ! i also think that this is an amazing book because it makes you think that a lake pond or pool may be connected to the sea and that you can get any type of fish from the gulf coast or anywhere i would recomend this book to anyone because it is really creative imaginative and entertaining 
encouraging i ve always been a fan of saul williams eversince slam this book continues in his quest to paint pictures with his words but on a love level i loved it also recommended im bored with christianity by derrick engo 
the platonic ideal of a historical novel perfection this is a book that dumps you squarely in the agora the symposium the trireme and the battlefield there is not a single wasted syllable not one sentence that rings false like a mozart symphony it is exactly right the platonic ideal of what a historical novel should be being set in the era of imperial athens it naturally incorporates its own tragedy more than one in fact almost effortlessly it leaves you understanding just why the athenians behaved the way they did and how their arrogance led to disaster great historical figures spring from the pages with all their faults and weaknesses as well as their magnificent virtues plato socrates alcibiades xenophon critias and many others yet alongside the lucid rationality of socrates which rings true down the millennia alexias and his contemporaries inhabit a world of gods and demons zeus poseidon apollo athene and the furies are just as real to them as the mountains and the sea 
every parent should read it an excellent book every parent should read it 
the best i have read on this subject by far this work is comprehensive well researched and just as importantly well written not only is the music addressed but the problems this music encountered in the early years something that is now often forgotten is throughly examined the social impact of this music one of the most important aspects in my way of feeling is examined in great detail of less personal interest to me was the business end but that is just me but i feel that many would find this fascinating as well as the rest this work goes along way in helping understand r r our society in general and our culture in particular i found this to be a well organized easy read and one that i do recommend for your library 
a different wodehouse book someday i d like to read a real biography of wodehouse as opposed to the dreadful quotfanquot bios out there and find out what was happening to him around when he wrote the scathing angry quotlaughing gas quot and this one quotsummer moonshine quot uses wodehouse plot a boy chasesgirlatcountryhouse yet strange feelings of hopelessness and despair creep into it and when boy loses girl there s a bitterness like in no other wodehouse novel it s not bad but you definitely get the sense that as the author himself might put it something s up 
great book recommend to any value investor a real hidden gem well written and a must read for anyone following the buffett graham style of investing this is not a how to invest like buffett book but it does give a look at his life and character and offers hope that anyone can invest like buffett checkedout from the library more money from investing 
a great book for women training for a triathlon i bought my daughter this book at christmas and she thought i was crazy she had suffered an injury in high school soccer that would prevent her from playing the sport competitively again so i just looked at this book and liked the contents and gave it to her well you can guess what happened nothing ! then my wife her mother started reading it and training and my daughter joined her and now they both are participating in triathlons and even winning their age divisions is it because of the book no it is because they are committed to succeeding and the book gave them the information they needed to do just that no matter what book you read it will do you no good unless you act 
mobius rocks i am a new knitter after taking a class on the mobius method and getting into cat bordhi s fun and quirky head it will be very boring for me to pick up any of my other started projects i have this and the first book and was able to create many quick christmas presents that were a hit cat has found many ways that have simplified so many of the knitting methods i am now able to transfer her methods to other knitting book patterns that i was afraid to try i highly recommend trying these books you won t believe how how fun and strange it is and knitting will never be the same for you 
great time travel novel i stumbled across this title from another readers list and tracked down a copy at our library it was well worth the search ! not a romance but just a great read i couldn t put it down 
enjoyed this third of the series as much as the first the story of anne continues with this work and the author stays true to her style story line and character developement this like the other books in this series have a rather timeless nature about them and a comforting charm the reader of course must remember the time they were written and the style and syntax used at that time from my own point of view this is great i enjoy this type of writing and certainly enjoy ms montgomery s story telling abilities in this work anne goes off to redman college and her adventure continues recommend these books for readers of all ages wish there were more works out there like it 
the song of the flowers while the black tulip lacks the swashbuckling derring do adventures of the other dumas novels i have read it is every bit as enjoyable to read beginning with the arrest of two brothers deemed traitors to the throne dumas holland based story at least begins with as strong a conflict as his other more action laced novels but the story while shifting focus to the godson of one of the men arrested concerns his passion and pursuit of the highly coveted black tulip a strain of holland s most popular horticultural export cornelius van baerle a man of comfortable means is little concerned with his wealth or with position or at all suspicious of the papers left in his care by his godfather prior to his arrest m van baerle has but one pursuit one goal and one dream to produce a flawless rare black tulip thus his downfall as an avaricious neighbor isaac boxtel shares this dream but for entirely different reasons while cornelius van baerle cares not for the riches and fame associated with growing such a flower boxtel covets both and plots to eliminate his competition and abscond with the delicate blossom which will net him one hundred thousand florins more than enough to live like the king himself m van baerle is therefore convicted of treason when boxtel reveals the existence of the papers of va baerle s godfather to the authorities and m van baerle finds himself on the wrong side of prison bars however the appearance of an unexpected love awakens passions in cornelius to rival those he feels for the black tulip and ignites a desire in him to share the possible wealth associated with the flower simply to assure it s development and care thus the race is on to plant grow and deliver the black tulip to the horticultural society dumas writing skills are in fine form with this shorter novel sparing none of the humor grace and elegance of other works of his i have indulged in and while foils are left in scabbards no plots to overthrow a corrupt cardinal materialize and revenge is not sought against the bad guysthis novel is every bit as exciting a fine way to experience one of france s most prolific historical authors for the first time or to further explore his catalogue of works

the answer while devouring this book i really felt that i was getting close to quote unquote the answer that s how powerful it was on both me and as i see some of my fellow reviewers so much of it has to do with making decisions and making decisions is an integral part of soren k s definition of truth but you have to get at it subjectively not objectively there s one part where let s say you the reader are in prison and you will get your head chopped off by the guillotine tomorrow you are afraid naturally i as your friend can talk to you and say objectively oh you re worried about the guillotine tomorrow you see it s very simple you just walk out to the scaffold put your head down on the slab of wood making sure to put your neck in the appropriate neck hole they will cut a rope the blade of the guillotine will come down your head will be chopped off and it will all be over in a minute you the subjective decision maker do not see it in the same way 
fast read wherever jack reacher goes trouble seems to follow he can t even have a quiet cup of coffee without a crime taking place in front of him this is the th book in the reacher series and they seem to be getting better and better can t wait for the next one to come out 
too many mistaken reviews i find it surprising that so many reviewers find this unrealistic and too intellectual for discussion of desire this is not a nonfiction research text on prostitution a sexuality manual or a work of realistic fiction in fact it is just the opposite of all of those things it is a simple parable wrought with symbolism which makes a complex universal point the story is engaging philosophical light and familiar despite making an important and essentially human observation about the timelessness of love and sex it is this wisdom and timelessness that captures the hearts of coelho readers time and time again 
attractive concept but some missed opportunities the american auto factory is a historical and sociological look at the development and changes in technology which directly impacted both workers and management told through vivid pictures and concise text or so i believed what was actually there was only partial to my perception beyond the vivid and captivating pictures was a very dull and unexciting narrative of the history of the american auto industry not that the history itself is uninteresting rather it has been told countless times before in numerous books in more detail then provided here the american auto factory should have focused its narrative on the changing conditions and relationship of the men and eventually women working in the factories portrayed both through pictures and text decade by decade i expected a discussion on the changes in technology and how it effected workers perceptions and relationships with management their jobs and each other unfortunately the authors decided to provide a simple historical narrative on the auto industries main players gm ford and chrysler with minor discussion on the independents in the corresponding chapters having said all of that it still doesn t take away from the beautiful pictures included if the authors did one thing perfectly right it was to dig up all those archived photos and include them in this book including diego rivera s famous or infamous to some mural detroit industry the pictures are wonderful and convey an entrancing story of the auto factory from the way it was to the way it is buy this book if you want to be visually captivated at the workers and their machines in the process of creating the automobile don t buy it if you want a better understanding at how workers were and still are affected by these same machines 
great prep for a meeting with lawyer and acct some reviewers have mentioned the fact that this doesn t delve into specifics enough and that all it does do is give you a list of questions to take with you to ask a real estate lawyer or an accountant while this is true i feel that is not necessarily a negative no book should have pretend to have all the answers especially when talking about real estate where there are many variables that make each situation unique so yes it does not give you definite answers but it is valuable as a preparation tool and as examples of possibilities 
my year old son absolutely loves this book the book talks about actual pirates and their adventures my year old son absolutely loves it 
satisfying read a very romantic story somewhat graphic with quite of bit of swearing but in a low key way i read it and then read it again a few days later too long to read in one sitting it made me cry 
taking sides i ll take the whole book this series of books is a must for anyone interested in modern political thought it is as interesting as quotcrossfirequot with more substance and depth the editors political experience shows in the selection of authors and pieces chosen though i m sure the editors have their own opinions both sides of each issue are well represented they have carefully culled differing points of view from intelligent people who make their arguments persuasively highly recommended 
sister sister by a manette ansay was a good book it told about a young catholic girl and he brother growing up on a farm in wisconsin they go through many changes as the mother takes a part time job while the son s battles with the father grow with time until the son disappears without a trace in the years to come after her brother s disappearance the girls becomes a distant spectator unable to fill the hole left by her younger brother and unable to rebuild the bond between her parents while loosing herself in the process 
excellent i absolutely loved this sequel to something borrowed just as good as the first in my opinion 
excellent a mind opener after reading this book and listening to the audio tape as well i must say i was transformed i used her tape to guide my meditations during which i had a vision of my sister in the hospital i called home and found out my sister was in emergency surgery and had almost died if we just open our mind it s amazing what we can see 
quotzeldaquot by nancy milford i absolutely adored this book it is extremely depressing at times to read considering the life of the woman the book is based upon but other than that it was fascinating milford writing style is unique as well as informative and quite objective the details about zelda s life could only come from an author who has done her research i would definetly recommend this book 
you have got to buy it this is a great book and i highly recomend it to any one over the age of or that loves horses 
words of biblical wisdom the marvels of the monastic garden monastic origins nothing is more likely than alexandrian christianity gained adherents among the therapeutae and that their institutions were adapted to the new religion eusebius was so much struck by the likeness of the therapeutae to the christian monks of his own day as to claim that they were christians converted by the preaching of st mark which is most likely the semi anchoritic character of the therapeutae community the renunciation of property the solitude during the six days of the week and the gathering together on saturday for the common prayer and the common meal the severe fasting the keeping alive of the memory of god the continuous prayer the meditation and study of holy scripture were also practices of the christian anchorites of the alexandrian desert prof c scouteris the desert a city in the fourth century the deserts of egypt became the center of a resurgent therapeutae movement we now call monasticism groups of christians illiterate peasants as well as learned intellectuals moved out to the deserts beyond the nile valley and in the famous words of saint athanasius made the desert a city they perfected the techniques of discipleship and spiritual direction of prayer and asceticism that have remained central to monasticism ever since seeking to guide the soul s long journey into god plotting out the subtle ills of the human heart they practiced wisdom sayings and maintained oral tradition of the fathers teachings these desert monks were also brilliant storytellers some of christianity s finest inspiring the eastern monastic communities and translated to became classics of western spirituality the word in the desert the growing scholarly attention in recent years to the religious world of late antiquity has focused new attention on the quest for holiness by the strange compelling often obscure early christian monks known as the desert fathers yet until now little attention has been given to one of the most vital dimensions of their spirituality their astute penetrating interpretation of scripture rooted in solitude cultivated in an atmosphere of silence oriented toward the practical appropriation of the sacred texts the desert fathers hermeneutic profoundly shaped every aspect of their lives and became a significant part of their legacy this unique book explores the setting of which the early monastic movement emerged the elders interpretive methods as a catalyst of the desert fathers quest for holiness and the spiritual meaning lived through their words words only as response the word of biblical wisdom centered on sayings and teachings of jesus christ were taken seriously by the desert fathers as a personal guide for their lives later on through careful analysis of their sayings the apophthegmata partum called by coptic monks and laity the monastic garden were recorded and used as early as the pachomian later koinonia and read to this moment in the refractory during meals to the congregating coptic monks starting with their hermeneutic and how scripture was their fountain for holiness d burton christie offers a fascinating tour in their ever living thought that reveals secrets of the continuity of coptic monastic traditions from its origin and through its growth within the setting in sketes the monastic tradition of silence limits advise to a question as st macarius instructing us in response to evagrius ponticus request do not speak unless when asked to i e in response to a question wisdom words in response to a question was the basic way of teaching in alexandria catechetical school in q a an effective neoplatonic tradition epilogued b c came to few conclusions of his in depth analytical study of the desert fathers stressing the vital role at which scripture permeated their experience and shaped their capacity to make sense and live the word and inspired their quest for holiness and shaped their spirituality he rightly concluded that scripture may have played a central role in this process and that certain key biblical texts may have influenced the development of early monasticism he claims that it is utterly clear that the texts were proclaimed recited memorized especially the psalms ruminated upon and discussed most cited scripture the author gave an index of biblical citations and their frequency in the sayings the most complete count is from mortari s translation biblical citations from the ot psalms is the most frequent then genesis isaiah and quotations of matthew are the most frequent from the nt followed by luke and john hebrews and james reflect the alexandrine tradition from revelation only this confirms that in spite of the differences in the sources of the sayings the greek translation albeit some obvious glosses is generally representative for a coptologist it is clear that a story as the identity of melchizedek p is a byzantine addition since this monks bragging is contrary to the tradition 
a good introduction to concepts of modern image generation i recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand modern concepts of how to generate images through computacional mathematical methods it is realy a new approach to join fractals cellular growth and computer concepts and limitations the code does not work well in window 
good crichton not his best intriguing as always exciting from the first page strong for the first rds and less editorializing than usual but it s just not as good as his higher concept novels but it s still very enjoyable all the way through and as always makes you think it feels a little dated now but i re read it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time sphere should definitely be a part of any crichton fan s library skip the movie though here the science is less convincing than in jurrassic park which is mostly convincing but stretched and prey which is better writing and fun but not convincing but that doesn t matter because crichton can write an adventure like few others as long as character isn t important characters here take backseat to concept and science pace as always is good more a rollicking adventure than something to think about typical of later novels and quite enjoyable on that level it s the kind of novel you ll tear through in a weekend at most and that s a good thing 
truly a timeless classic this book is a must read for people of all ages i don t know about the dover thrift editions i got mine at barnes and noble so i suggest you check that version out old ben franklin was an amazing man he truly was this book is one of the best i have ever read this is a must read for everyone ! i can t believe we never read this in school ! it should be a mandatory read anyway please read this book and i assure you you will enjoy this insightful unprecedented man i promise you will how there are so few men of that class today ! 
worth reading for newlyweds or those married for a number of years this book has many gems of wisdom to offer my husband and i have been married for years and read the book together and found it refreshing and helpful in some areas where we recognized chronic tension in our relationship the authors overall assessments of a variety of relationships and wisdom for handling various issues that arise between committed couples is on target it is worth reading and would make a good gift for weddings or anniversaries ! 
painting the impressionist landscape lois griffel s painting the impressionist landscape is very simply a must have for the library of anyone interested in using color to capture their surroundings in paint anyone interested in bringing their work to a new level of the many books on my shelf this is the one that i would not do without lois griffel has demystified a painting process made it easy to understand and given us a way to practice it the oft dreaded block studies she has successfully fulfilled her stewardship of the cape cod school started by charles hawthorne and developed by henry hensche she is a great teacher who should be read and studied by anyone interested in color especially painters both experienced and beginner alike many of today s greatest painters studied with hensche the rest of us can get a touch of the training here great book ! thank you lois griffel 
good addition to the series but not my favorite elizabeth s wolf fits in between lora leigh s first two feline breed stories tempting the beast and the man within and the third kiss of heat time wise ew is better developed than some of her others but for some reason it didn t please me like tempting the beast for instance the story starts off with our military hero dash wounded and in a foreign hospital nobody knows that he is a man made creation with genes spliced from wolf dna and it is his animal instincts which he has kept hidden thus far that is telling him to get out and to find the little girl who has written to him while convalescing after he recovers and is released he sets out to find the little girl and her mom elizabeth once he finally connects with them they concoct a plan along with the feline breeds and a couple new friends to finish off the man who has been ruthlessly hunting down elizabeth and her daughter i think what bothered me most about the book was the name of the hero dash sinclair i guess that s a puny excuse for something pulling down a story for me but it did just too cliched for me the little girl in the story is precocious per usual but her story is intriguing enough i hope someday leigh will write her tale of love im gonna give this one a out of a good enough addition to the breed series but not my favorite 
comprehesive reference on nw gardening of the books i own on nw native plant gardening this book is my most often referenced it is full of detailed information about a vast array of nw native plants dr kruckeberg s enthusiasm for the propogation and stewardship of nw natives shines throughout the book however this is not a book about landscaping or effective planting combinations it is a scholarly work that may be useful to a homeowner interested in native plants and their care or to the professional landscaper in need of detailed reference information i am impressed by the breadth of the author s knowledge 
touch a dark wolf i loved it i can not wait until the next book i have read every book written by her and they are awesome thank you jenni please write more

gentle as a lamb sheep are appealing creatures known for being gentle indeed our very lexicon includes the expression gentle as a lamb so it comes as no suprise that many delightful books for pre schoolers involve sheep in some form the ovine theme works like a charm in this book it takes its place among other good ovine literature such as sherman the sheep and sheep in a jeep this book does a nice job of blending fact and fantasy sheep are drawn in pastoral settings happily eating daisies grass and clovers as well as being anthropormorphized and engaged in human activites such as fixing a car sleeping in a bed taking baths and dancing young children will find that this book will keep their attention the language is clear and direct without overdoing the point is made right off the bat cognitive concepts such as color up down in and out are included one can also interpret the sheep of many colors blue red etc as being a metaphor for diversity and acceptance the quest for the green sheep makes for very humorous reading indeed the writing together with the excellent illustrations make for a very nice package indeed regardless of level of degree in matters ovine readers and listeners alike will enjoy the pure fun of this book people of all ages will laugh at the ovine antics and get a charge out of finding out the whereabouts of that green sheep ! 
best series my eyes ever read the first two books of the series ghost king amp last sword of power are not necessarily needed in the jon shannow adventure but if you want a little bit of a base on the history of the stones of power then i would recommend you read the whole series but if you want to get to the really good stuff then start with number three i garuntee when you finish number five you will wish there were lots more to follow i 
among the top spiritual books of all time this is one of the best spiritual exercises in history especially for teachers students theologians missionaries and anyone involved in teaching of any sort thomas words provoke deep thoughtfulnes and concern in ones sprituality and remind us to be vigilant in our service to the truth 
as close as it gets if you ever have wondered what life is like in a federal penitentiary this book pretty much covers it forget all the text books and hard core prison movies this is as close as it gets to the real thing i just wish earley would have used the real names of the inmates the staff mentioned in this book are truly real and legendary in the federal penal system most have since retired you won t put the book down good read for real cheap 
perfect for me this is the best layout with lots of color pictures to illustrate step by step the recipes i have a handful of well rated japanese cookbooks but this one has the best layout so it is my favorite and the one i want to recommend it makes me want to get cooking this book s style is of the kind found in books that are sold in asian bookstores as with all the japanese cookbooks i own the writers mention chinese cooking to compare and declare that something is similar but uniquely japanese however that is not true but the authors are not authorities on chinese cooking and culture so they can t be expected to know everything or anything true about chinese authenticity i bear this in mind and forgive the errors because i buy the book out of interest in japanese not chinese cooking this book contains much fewer references and assumptions to chinese than the other cookbooks such as the false claim that the cheap bamboo steamer baskets are the archetypal chinese steamer equipment and that the square steamers or metal steamers are not chinese one can say that this is more procedure and less editorializing than other cookbooks this book could be sold in a chinese bookstore without being offensive and would delight the chinese with its recipes i recommend this book and wish the author had written more than two books 
i love a combination of jorge s books i ve read of jorge cruise s books and found something i was looking for in each of them minutes in the morning book pros love the exercises cons hate the eating card system minutes for real shapes real sizes book pros love his enthusiasm journaling ideas goal setting and how he addresses emotional eating system for controlling portions is very easy to follow cons exercises are too easy overall the hour diet pros love the science behind eating every hours cons in reality it s hard to stick to a hour schedule exercise plan is nearly non existent in this book while each book has it s strong and weak points overall jorge s ideas do work in the course of months i lost pounds real shapes sizes provided the motivation and portion control minutes provided the exercise routine and the hour plan kept me for eating too often 
the secret life of bees the era and the setting of the novel was something i could relate to growing up in the s and s and knew it was a tumultuous time the book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the south during the civil rights era it was wonderfully told and beautifully written 
great book my girlfriend gave me this book and told me i needed to use it to have a long life after reading it i think it will help me do just that this book has great advice on health and nutrition and i hope i can have the discipline to put its instructions into practice 
best cookbook nutrition reference ever a comprehensive listing of super foods their selection storage and preparation methods that include the best ways to preserve nutrients i m now hooked on crimini mushrooms didn t know they could be so yummy ! plus it s easy to learn about and try new foods that some of us weren t necessarily raised on a must have for people interested in good nutrition 
so glad it found me i probably wouldn t have bought this had i known it was a short story collection but i m so glad i did as with any short story collection there are highlights and lowlights but in this one there are very few lowlights and the vast majority of the stories are and star reads highly recommended 
all night runner as an ultra runner myself i know dean personally anmd have met him a few times having run myself for eyears on every continent myself i certainly can nrelate to his stories i am not interested in finishinmg times but rather enjoy the experience being in nature dean i think is opver doing iot a little andn maybe not too many people can relate to what he does on teh same level however i think the book was well wtritten also the appeal and audience may have been somewaht limited it espouses several good human qualities such as detemination disciplene and endurance all attribute sthat will benefit anybody throughout life all in all i think this is an excellent book well written and certainly entertaining to read even if you are not a runner 
a solid book for beginners especially loose players card stud by roy west is a solid book for beginning players not complete beginners but beginners nonetheless the first lessons are on card stud in medium and lower limits the next are on general poker issues and the last are written by tom mcevoy on stud tournaments i found the book to be good for players that need to be told how to play although not necessary why to play in a certain way west advice is to play tight and aggressive when you have the best of it but sometimes his advice seems too much on the tight and conservative side maybe this is good for the beginning player to play too conservatively since most players in the medium and lower limits have the exact opposite problem they play too loose for most beginners who are too loose they are going to benefit from this book if they follow the west s advice to be tight they will likely improve their results 
my commentary on the commentary i needed this book fast for class i m a seminary student i got it quick and didn t miss a quiz if you know what i mean ! i am a loyal customer steve 
solid not spectacular entry from douglas preston while not as much of a page turner as the codex tyrannosaur canyon is a good read that will appeal to the fans of preston and child reuniting tom and sally broadbent from the codex was a welcome decision for this reviewer both characters are well drawn and interesting the plot takes off when tom stumbles upon a dying prospector who hands him a small notebook filled with coded figures the prospector asked tom to give the notebook to robbie the next pages are filled with tom s attempt to return the notebook while at the same time tying to solve the mystery left behind by the prospector spectacular scenery and interesting gadgets abound in this book preston even manages to mix in a little government conspiracy and a black ops group in the quick moving plot through not necessarily a memorable novel fans of the genre and of preston and child will no doubt want to add tyrannosaur canyon to their must read list 
europes first republic this is the best history ever written about the dutch revolt a series of upheavals from to which led to the independent united provinces this was europes first republic which survived until the french revolution 
this book tells it like it is this was a great read and the authors are to be commended for their research and honesty the women s organizations have become dishonest political organizations bent on their own survival and which skew facts and figures in order to propagate the myth that women are still victims in our society in need of special protection their organizations survival is dependent upon the success or failure of this myth and the book does a great job of exposing how these organizations twist and bend the truth to suit their own purposes the playing field has not only been leveled it is tilting the other way ! i highly recommend this book for people who want to know the true facts regarding gender equality in this country 
a great read this book is informative amusing and easy to read i enjoyed it very much 
true north confirms harrison s reputation first let me say jim harrison is the best quotliteraryquot writer working today i formed that opinion based on some of his earlier work farmer a good day to die and so had high expectations for true north i wasn t disappointed the novel follows the quest of the protagonist david burkett as he tries to come to terms with the evil done by his father to others and to the land he loves david finds more ambiguities than answers though and the clear sense of right and wrong that drives him begins to erode davids complex relationships with his family and to the natural world as shaded by the past are expertly explored this is harrison in top form 
concise but comprehensive concise but comprehensive might sound like a contradiction but i couldn t think of any other way to describe it john piper really introduced me to jonathan edwards and between the two of them i would say that no other author has had as much of an impact upon me in the last few years as these two now piper introduces us to augustine luther and calvin also this is the first book in a series of three and well worth the investment i read it in my spare time in just week have the second book ready to go but regret not purchasing the third at the same time piper s strength is not only in presenting one very compelling argument about the triumph of god s grace or sovereign joy but to do it by presenting numerous facets of the work of augustine luther and calvin which are easy to follow and understand gives an excellent overview of their lives and ministries and which leaves you wanting to and feeling confident of being able to read from the original sources every page was a gem be warned though i got about pages into the book then realised my mistake i should have read this book with a pencil and note pad in hand ! there are so many great quotes from augustine luther and calvin not to mention piper himself that you ll want to write some of them down to chew over later or file away for sermon illustrations this is an easy read and a great introduction the some major figures in church history not to mention excellent food for the soul in a day when people are so biblically illiterate as well as ignorant or contemptible of church history this book demonstrates that our impoverishment is foolish and unnecessary we need more books like this ! i would have given it stars if i could simply on price readability and content alone

just what this knitter needed i taught myself to knit from books when i was a teenager now that i m in my s i ve knitted for many years but still didn t know some of the common tricks of the trade i might have learned if i had been taught by an old pro or if i had taken classes this book fills in the gaps and gives me lots of ideas about how to work around problems it also increased my understanding of some technical details of knitting that i would never have figured out on my own easy to read well organized and a useful reference book to keep on hand 
periodizing the s camera politica is a must for all who are interested in studying the development of film studies in this book michael ryan and douglas kellner offer a plethora of studies of films from the late s to the s in order to make a larger argument about that period of history their basic premise is that these films are in a dialectical relationship to the rise of conservative politics in the s meaning the growing sentiment of conservativism informs films like dirty harry and rambo but at the same time the development of a full fledged conservative popular culture in which these films are involved creates a social milieu in which conservative politics appears attractive and the remedy to growing economic and social disturbances they also criticize liberals for feeding into conservative filmic representations often identifying the same ills as conservatives in their own attempts at cultural production but more significantly liberal critics did not offer counter representations that would do the same culture work that the conservative films of the late s and s did thus they call for a new radical cinema they are marxist in orientation though they are clearly aligned with feminisms radical race theorists and student radicals and so they are suggesting that a marxian culture and a marxist cinema must come into being this cinematic culture must diagnose problems but it also must offer remedies that speak to the large majority of people perhaps most provocatively especially for the time this book was written ryan and kellner claim that this new marxian cinema can take the form of the popular hollywood film and in fact it must if it wants to reach mainstream society though this book is a periodization of films it also offers new theoretical devices the first is the notion of transcoding a film transcodes social attitudes the second is ideology the ideological work of hollywood cinema is to try and offer remedies for social ills but in so doing it must admit ills do in fact exist thus ideology is double edged the third is diagnostic critique the method of reading films that excavate both the ideological containment and the problem being identified at this point in history camera politica might appear a bit dated but if anyone is interested in doing a historical periodization of american culture this book is simply a must if anyone is new to the area of visual and film culture and wants a book that might offer some theoretical methods as well as demonstrations of readings then they might want to pick this book up this book is a bit of an overlooked classic and it should be considered a staple in film studies 
should be recommended reading for everyone interested in this subject patrick heron has done an excellent job explaining the nephilim this book has answered all my questions 
very good book i loved reading this book i am only interested in reading stories like this one and this one was great ! i recommend you get this book asap ! 
caution ! dekker may contain adictive qualities i first found ted dekker in goodwill while i was hunting for games for my old school super nintendo snes his book blink caught my eye and i did my is it a good book test on it i opened to the middle pages and read both and was entrapped from that moment in goodwill i havent been able to put dekkers worlds out of my mind and this series is no different after i found and bought this book i couldn t put it down until i finished the whole series which i did in days blackthis story starts off in an incredible way hopefully without giving too much of the plot away i can tell you about it we find a man named thomas hunter running for his life in the alleys of a city the next chapter we stumble on a man who s lost all memories of self in a evil forest outrunning giant black bats while initally confusing black sets the score for two of the most epic and historic events ever in two different realities and hunter is caught in both in one world a leathal airborne virus is about to wipe out the entire population of the planet and in the other the threat of the shakati black bats rises and boils over boundaires follow thomas as he tries to figure out why him and fight with him as he learns and struggles to be heard and to surive 
vivre le lonely planet en paris after many a trip to paris lonely planet still stands out as the guidebook of guidebooks this edition has great restaurant reviews as is common with lp guides we have never been steered wrong unless it was to a place that had gone out of business and therefore was no longer open to avoid this you can always call ahead of time if you are really concerned what i always like about lp is the background info they give on the city plus they recommend books music and movies to get you in the mood for your travels the hotel info is good though their prices are not always totally accurate understandable hotels change their rates yearly and therefore may not always be updated in real time what is accurate is the ranges they give budget mid range high endthey also have top restaurants top sites depending on the arrondissement you are in this is great because if you are on the go it saves you the trouble of reading each restaurant review or each museum site description you will probably want to buy a map to accompany you as the ones in the back of the book are adequate but could be better we have traveled with rough guide maps very convenient and weather safe with relatively large print lp makes maps too but i prefer the rg sif you are lucky enough to go to paris this is a great guide to have in your bag it is also a great pre trip guide and reading the background or getting some of they books they recommend before you step on the plane can only enhance your experience i would recommend a moveable feast by ernest hemingway a fantastic book about his days in paris in the s 
the very best of sunset i truly love these annuals and it shows every one of my sunset annuals is spattered and bookmarked because i use them so often these are well bound highly colorful editions filled with the years collection of sunset recipes they are catalogued by ingredients vegetables fruits beef etc as well as by category so looking up a recipe is easy the biga bread recipe is worth the price alone everything is well laid out with lots of helpful hints to ensure success whether you re baking a cake or creating an exotic asian dish what i appreciate most about sunset is all their recipes are tested in their own kitchens to make sure the average home user can recreate them easily it gives you that extra bit of confidence when trying something new if you want a durable practical and highly usable cookbook i recommend giving the sunset annuals a try 
i would start with another willis if you have not yet read her lincolns dreams was interesting i have come to a conclusion about connie willis that might not make sense to you if you have not yet come to appreciate books on tape i have now read pretty much every work that willis has published every book that i have read has been a little dry a little slow and the plot just sludge s forwards at a creeping pace i have found it very difficult to actually enjoy the nuance willis employs through her characters the main thing is that i am constantly attempting to hurry through to push the plot along which is not really what a willis book is about more than any other author i have noticed willis is the perfect author to read slowly and succinctly in a spoken out loud manner by treating her this way you will be rewarded with some of the best subtle character interactions around so if you find yourself frustrated by willis when your holding one of her books in your hands before you give up on her you might want to find her on tape first sadly i don t think that lincoln s dreams is on tape its not her best work anyways i would totally start with to say nothing of the dog this is an amazing experience even if you have read the book before you will get a lot of new insight into a complicated tale by taking this advice her other works on tape are a short story collection and doomsday book try these and you wont be disappointed to get to say nothing on tape try your library i bet they wont have a copy but they can still get it for you at most likely no or a minimal charge through an interlibrary loan program ask them at the desk about this and someone will help you out if you haven t done this before its easy and if you enjoy the experience of to say nothing half as much as i did you will be hooked on the medium dang i haven t even really talked about lincolns dreams yet it s sort of confusing the story line gets a little muddled at the end i re read the last couple of chapters to see if i missed something but i don t think that i did it kind of reminded me of murakami swind up bird chronicle s ending a book that was equally confusing in its conclusion you will totally see signs of willis future genius in this book 
enjoyable hilarious and hold up over time never read a book by this guy but he s touted as being against big government so i thought i d take a swing it s a pretty scathing book and i loved every minute of it o rourke tackles all the politics of the day the day being just after bush i took office what s great about going back and reading a book like this is seeing whether or not his predictions came true not that there are a lot of predictions but the ones that are there are pretty dead on the great thing is that o rourke actually does some journalistic work he spends a day or two in congress tags along with congressmen checks out government offices interviews foreign dignitaries etc and comes away with some great conclusions because of that o rourke is able to do something that seems almost impossible humanizing politicians these guys work hard i guess you would have to in order to waste the money and time the government does but they work hard and they believe in what they re doing no matter how ridiculous it actually is so essentially we have not necessarily elected crooks and thieves to congress rather we ve elected good people way out of touch oh and some of them are crooks and thieves but o rourke puts the blame squarely where it belongs in a democracy he does that is if you believe voting makes a difference i guess that s what makes him a republican and what makes me not don t worry though if you re a democrat o rourke seems to be an equal opportunity scather and the situations he presents will make even the staunchest advocates of babysitting government try to figure out how we allowed this to happen being neither a republican or democrat allowed me to squeal with glee at just about everything he wrote we did though and thank goodness otherwise we d never get a fine book like this 
problem solving toolkit book book info i read the nd edition that was published in pre required knowledge or literature nonegeneral the book is easy to read although quite often there are examples used to make the same point because the examples are quite good or examples would have done as well book content the book starts with an introduction part what is very easy to understand which handles some real life problem examples chapter handles some simulated problem experiments and statistical feedback of the participants of those experiments results of these experiments among others are used in chapter in chapters aspects of problem solving are explained with reasons of why we as human beings have problems with those aspects chapter the demands chapter setting goals chapter information and models chapter time sequences chapter planning the final chapter tries to give some help how to approach problems basically it comes down to the point that there is not method to use in problem solving but the book gives you a set of tools which can be used in problem solving situations the selection of specific tools is what we have to do as human beings based on the kind of problem that we are dealing with

quothow to write and think clearly about any subject at all quot i think we all have a quotfearquot of certain subjects for me that fear manifests itself in the field of math i was terrified of it in school and even now would rather discuss almost any other subject zinsser helps us face our fear of subjects we think we don t understand by writing how will that help you probably know a lot about the work you do you could probably also write very competently about your profession in quotwriting to learn quot zinsser shows us that writing across the curriculum which is very prominent in education right now can help anyone learn how to organize and present their thoughts in a logical manner so that they can be understood by those who might otherwise be intimidated by them zinsser gives many examples from writers that support his statement that writing is helpful in all subjects in the curriculum science history music math math how can you write about math it s all in zinsser s book which is as entertaining as it is informative 
the best of its type csapo s book is a must read for anyone interested in myth theory especially as it pertains to greco roman myth not only does he give detailed explanations of the theories he covers but he also does a good job of explaining the cultural milieu from which each theory arose this cultural approach makes it easy for him to draw attention to some of the weaknesses of each theory though he treats all of them with the appropriate respect my one warning would be that while his style is pretty easy to follow the book can be a bit dense at times and might alienate those who don t already have a working knowledge of most of these theories so while i wouldn t recommend this book for high school students looking to cut their teeth on myth theory alan dundes sacred narratives or fritz graf s greek mythology would be better for that this book is a real treasure for more advanced students and will even help those already acquainted with the ideas gain fresh perspectives on them

autism to the nth degree although i was never a fan of the science fiction fantasy genres i loved this book the young wizards were appealing characters who reside in very real nassau county new york communities each wizard is introduced to readers so people who have not read the previous works in this series won t feel like they have to play catch up to understand the flow of the story kit the wizard who is featured most prominently in this book discovers his beloved dog ponch has some wizardlike properties boy and dog are able to communicate in ways they had never previously been able to do nita another young wizard in their midst is still grieving over the death of her mother whose life was prolonged thanks to nita s magical prowess enter darryl a boy with severe autism darryl faces severe communication challenges and is enrolled in a self contained program in a local nassau county school kit finds himself in the mind of this child whose speech is limited at best sporadic at worst he discovers darryl mulls things over from different perspectives changes his mind frequently is highly imaginative as his mental imagery will attest to along with this information kit learns of the dark powers of the challenging forces of the lone power who threatens their very safety darryl has prescient dreams this is a characteristic many of stephen king s characters have darryl s autism is presented in a plausible and sympathetic fashion although this book does not purport to be any kind of a diagnostic tool it is delightful to see a wizard with autism and to see autism portrayed in a very different genre kudos to duane for presenting autism in a logical and accurate fashion this book is beautifully and brilliantly written to include autism in a very different context i really like the way kit s mother provided him with reading materials about autism and described it as best she could i thought it was a lovely act of grace on her part to allow kit to take a day off from school so he could study autism with the idea of helping darryl

had the chance to be excellent but is only a relatively good one i have read the whole ender series but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way i view the different books in the series the first book i have read was the shadow of the hegemon thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in skiathos island this book got me hooked but it confused me also as i didn t know if i should start reading the next books or the previous ones the general pattern in the whole series is the beginning book is ender s game then we have two subcategories one the shadow series which with the exception of the first book take place on earth and are more within military strategy and one the ender series which take place in space and are more into new sci fi ideas shadow series probably can be read from everyone while i guess that the ender series especially from speaker for the dead onwards would be read mainly from sci fi fans below are my comments for the books of the series in the order i have read them and a marking is the highest mark shadow of the hegemon the first book i have read and which i could not leave from my hands i finished it in days it was fast paced action very smart plot and after reading it i believed that orson scot card osc has invented reinvented a new genre of literature that of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance mind games and hidden portions of romance such books always existed but this seemed to be the book it was like the way dan brown re invented books with trivials and puzzles together with fast paced adventure i strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books mark shadow puppets the sequel to the above i found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling strategy brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here i would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book i really believe that osc made a mistake here deliberately or not as this book should have been told in pages and be included in the previous or the next book mark but you will read it because you will want to read shadow of the giant shadow of the giant see below enders game a really great book to read probably the best of the series however as i had read its sequels first when i reached the of this book i had predicted the end however it s at the highest standards of sci fi military strategy adventure brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters in comparison to the shadow series it is more space sci fi while shadow series have much lesser sci fi elements and are more down to earth mark speaker for the dead another great book but different style less adventure more human aspect more maturity brilliance yes but not military sci fi yes some great ideas but not spaceship style mark xenocide a good sequel of the previous novel in certain points more brilliant in other sections more boring however is again a very good sci fi book the only flaw in these series speker for the dead xenocide children of the mind is the idea behind one of the alien species described which i found outrageously extreme however if you ignore it becomes first class reading mark children of the mind i think that osc has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one it s a fair book except the fact that i felt that osc mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it in other critiques i have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas however moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated i felt like i was watching a movie worth oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie and again many open ends at the end for possible sequels mark but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones enders shadow having read enders game and shadow of the hegemon i found this book probably the best of the series which of course is my subjective preference i could characterize it as probably the best book i have read ever ! not to repeat myself it has all that shadow of the hegemon and ender s game have and even more mark the absolute shadow of the giant when i read shadow puppets i said thats it osc has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing so i was pretty unwilling to read it fortunately i decided to as it proved to be a good one were i believe that osc has nicely wrapped up his story with two small flaws the one is described below its end needed to be slightly more complete and the other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up it had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book mark in general both series have three categories of good stuff some great sci fi ideas battle room battle games fantasy game ansible aia jane in out travel raman varelse etc great military strategy mind games etc combined with adventure in certain books depth of characters moral dilemmas etcand two main bad stuff mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary either osc wanted just to produce and sell another title see shadow puppets or he could not decide how the story will continue see last book of ender series one of the alien species described in the ender series was so too outrageous even for sci fi that made it look ridiculous the idea behind it was brilliant in sci fi terms but he could try a different living organism finally osc has left open ends in both series probably for next sequels however i believe that there are two things missing a the story of the hive queen and the hegemon told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity b in ancient theatre a story should end in a way that brings katharsis to the story and the souls of the readers i believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full katharsis 
excellent read this is a must read for anyone considering home ownership i was able to learn many important things as well as pull together what i already knew in fact i nearly read the whole book the night i received it the book is also well written as the author is able to keep things flowing 
best description of a marine i ve read page has one of the best descriptions of the type of person who becomes a marine kopeland made me proud to be a marine 
an american classic this work is vastly different from one flew over but only in positive ways it is complex and intricate powerful and emotive kesey s simultaneous usage of multiple voices is awkward initially but smoothes over time the best way to approach sometimes is to read it once and then immediately begin anew and read it again on the second time through all the voice interruptions will make sense and your comphrehension of the novel will be therefore more complete i highly recommend this work to any serious fan of american literature and though it is a somewhat difficult read it is ultimately very fulfilling 
make time phillip larkin rocks when i was a sophmore in college i burned down my dorm room and my copy of high windows it was truly tragic this slim little volume contains some of larkin s best work it is wry revealing and sardonic in true larkin fashion i particularly like the title poem and none of the books have time also there s one in there about the stubborn stupidity of old folks that is absolutely delightful and hilarious though the title escapes me at the moment anyway this small book that won t take up either much time to read or much space on the shelf is a delightful and highly recommended piece one of my all time favorites 
good book but a few things off i enjoyed reading this book thanks to the way it was descriptively written like about stacey s father s day weekend in new york and how they spent time at fire island where stacey her dad and claudia are vacationing and where her boyfriend robert is vacationing at the same time there but she keeps it a secret claudia seemed to be jealous of stacey spending too much time with robert though and kept questioning their friendship and they got into a fight the baby sitters also came briefly for the trip and they made costumes for the fourth of july parade but it was a disaster and meanwhile stacey is getting all tangled up in her lies but she s not the only one who lied her dad was up to something too and keeping it from stacey maybe the book should have been called stacey and the big fat lies or something i also enjoyed reading about claudia s beautiful photography of sandcastles she built and how she got some publicity for it on the little island 
its really good this play is just amazing its a beautifully written simple love story but the characters are extremely captivating i reccomend reading this or seeing it if you can its great dont be fooled by how simple it is though its deceptively s

the spy business is a rotten apple to write a long trilogy on the very last months of the ddr from the point of view of the british secret services in is nearly anachronic so the author chose a completely different approach than a simple spy story it is a real novel with real and thick characters who do have a social existence and a cultural density the action is slower of course and the object of the novel is not to show us one more of those unbeatable james bond the object of the novel is to explore the human and unhuman definitely unhumane functioning of london central incredible conflicts between field agents and bureaucrats the severe hierarchization of these bureaucrats in the number of square meters of office space they get with or without a window with carpet or linoleum on the floor etc this constant inside strife is the main characteristic of london central the plot of the book will peter out because field agents have no say and bureaucrats forget essential elements the bureaucrats dream theories that bite the dust when implemented at times with casualties and yet they will survive with essentially two methods they will put the blame on their underlings and there is condescendence in this attitude they will cover up the failure with a false explanation that will make a kgb or stasi agent become a sniper in london and use an american weapon and all the night equipment necessary they will of course try to cover up the nature of the weapon for that reason the book is interesting we are under the surveillance and control constant control of secret services who are the most conflictual pot of spiders in the world we don t know them we have to trust them and we may find ourselves under crossfire bad luck and that has not changed since the end of the cold war far from it the advantage of this system was that it more or less shortcircuited terrorism nowadays we still have the conflictual antagonistic secret services plus the various terrorist organizations that provide some discontents with the possibility to express their anger at or their ambition in their society and world that are the cause of their discontentment dr jacques coulardeau universit paris dauphine universit paris i panthon sorbonne

you just have to know where to look scott weidensaul deserves recognition as one of the best naturalist writers working today here weidensaul follows in the cross continental footsteps of roger peterson the bird guide guy and james fisher who in the early s wrote about their bird watching journey across north america and created the environmentalist classic wild america weidensaul is also a bird fanatic reporting on the astonishing variety of avifauna he encountered while tracing the footsteps of peterson and fisher but he also imparts great amounts of knowledge on all other forms of wildlife as well as larger issues of ecosystem health weidensaul certainly finds that many of the natural areas visited by peterson and fisher fifty years previously are in worse shape nowadays with encroaching development and pollution and great decreases in plant and animal populations the most distressing example here is the continuing ecological disaster taking place in the florida everglades while the state of nature in several of the other areas covered is barely heartening however weidensaul actually finds that nature is surprisingly strong in some of the areas he visited such as the quickly urbanizing rio grande valley in texas or the forlorn pribilof islands off of alaska concerned local citizens in many bountiful areas are fighting for preservation and sustainable development though there is still much work to be done weidensaul s main point is that wilderness and wildlife is certainly on the decline and there s no reason to sugarcoat this troublesome reality but there are still pockets of tremendous natural vitality in north america if you know where to look for them weidensaul also fleshes out his great environmental reporting with occasional snippets of realistic politics which is a departure from his previous works this includes an outstanding final chapter in which he covers the state of environmentalism in america and tells it like it is with an honesty far beyond that of pundits and sloganeers doomsdayer

complete star wars trilogy radio dramas wonderful shows how did luke come to know biggs how did leia get the death star plans what happened to her in her cell after darth vader came in with the interrogation droid how did luke become a commander these questions which have been asked by many fans are answered in the original radio dramatizations of the star wars trilogy since some readers may be considering the purchase of one of the dramas or possibly the whole set i will endeavor to give details of all the dramas please note that this is an in depth review of all three dramas and is therefore somewhat more lengthy than many reviews you will encounter if you would prefer a shorter review please feel free to scroll to the next review i will start with the original star wars drama from in the star wars radio drama was released many people were skeptical about the success of a completely sound based star wars universe because star wars is a highly visual world that is based largely on visual special effects they wondered how star wars could be experienced without the stunning special effects of the movies though the drama does lack visual effects the sound effects from ben burtt and the wonderful score from john williams provide a fabulous listening experience many of the characters from the movies have been replaced with substitutes mark hamill takes on the role of luke skywalker and anthony daniels provides the voice of c po although the substitutes take some getting used to over all they make better representations of the characters than the movie actors do perry king provides a humorous han solo although his voice is gravelly he seems to be the kind of guy who could be han solo his wise mouth and humor enhance his image ann sachs takes on the role of princess leia although she lacks the cold voice of carrie fisher she displays more emotion to illustrate my point carrie fisher showed little audible horror when her planet and people were destroyed ann sachs provides a more realistic outpouring of sorrow and grief as she screams and cries out as her planet is savagely blown into space dust she also displays a great deal of emotion in the scene where darth vader is interrogating her in her cell this scene was not in the movies though the scene is not for the squeamish it does illustrate vader s cruelty and utter lack of caring his heartless mental attack and leia s screams of anguish and pain serve to drive home the sheer evil of darth vader and the empire brock peters plays darth vader although he can not replace james earl jones he has a deep booming voice that can turn from calm to anger in an instant he also displays emotion more effectively than james earl jones for example in the freezing pit of cloud city in the empire strikes back he expresses glee anger pleading and pain it is obvious from his increasing tone pitch and volume that he is becoming angry with luke mark hamill is irreplaceable as luke skywalker he is the perfect luke no one can be luke not even a substitute his cockiness at the beginning of the play when he races fixer turns to fear and anger as he meets ben and finds that the imperial troupes have slaughtered his aunt and uncle he eventually gives way to despair as ben is killed but he soon is filled with elation as he destroys tie fighters as the millennium falcon attempts to escape from the death star he and he only could be luke bernard behrens plays ben kenobi he does a wonderful job especially in the scene where he and vader fight anthony daniels and anthony daniels only could play c po he does a stupendous job of enhancing the personality of c po in this drama we find out how he and r d met and how their relationship came into being anthony daniels as c po and the electronic r d have a deeper friendship than is apparent in the movies their quarrels are often humorous the special effects in the drama are absolutely staggering many of the sounds from the movies and many more not found in the movies have been included despite the early time of its release the original drama is in full surround sound unlike in the movies the characters are also in full stereo in the movies the characters occupy the center channel while sounds occupy the side channels however in the radio dramas the characters music and sound all are stereo you can hear them moving in different directions in the movies it is apparent what they are doing by looking at them with radio there is no visual therefore there must be some way of letting the audience know what is going on since there is no narration besides that found in the beginning and end the characters must let the audience know what is happening in many radio plays this can be quite annoying however brian daley has cunningly written the script to make the descriptions realistic here is an example han storm trooper to your left blast ! aaargh storm trooper falls got em although the drama is not perfect i would highly recommend it due to its staggeringly advanced nature i would expect something of this magnitude and nature to have been made nowadays i can hardly imagine how such a monumental task was under taken without most of the computer and digitalized technology of today over all it is a stupendous performance it spans thirteen episodes each approximately a half hour for an overall running time of six and a half hours the empire strikes back radio drama is another delight the cast remains the same billy dee williams plays lando just as he does in the movies paul hecht plays the emperor he does a passable imitation of the emperor s voice though it could be more sibilant john lithgow does a great job as yoda although frank ozz is still the only true yoda john lithgow s imitation is pretty good this production features a huge number of sound effects not found in any of the movies those that are found in the movies have been used to their fullest extent this drama like the first is also in full surround sound the music just like in the first is absolutely stunning mark hamill puts on another phenomenal performance of luke skywalker when he is attacked he screams in fright and pain he coolly kills the wampa and escapes he attempts to walk through a blizzard back to base his performance there is wonderful as he strives to overcome hypothermia and the desire to lie down he actually seems to be freezing and shaking with cold his greatest achievement comes when he acts with brock peters in the scene on cloud city he meets vader with cocky confidence vader overcomes him and eventually he lets out an agonized scream of pain as his hand is cut from his body he seems to be in terrible pain as he learns that vader is his father he eventually falls onto a weather vane his desperate cries for ben and leia are heart wrenching as always the other members of the cast have made this play a distinct pleasure there are a wide variety of new characters and actors they all have done a wonderful job over all i would highly recommend this dramatization as well especially if it is combined with the first radio play the show has ten episodes each running for about a half hour for an overall running time of about five hours it s a superb listening experience the period after the empire strikes back radio drama was a dark time for public radio due to circumstances not related to the plays mentioned here funding of public radio was greatly lowered no more dramas were produced for many years finally funds were increased in the nineties highbridge audio released the first two dramas on tape and cd in their great success led to the decision to finally make return of the jedi the production team for the original dramas was brought together again and the actors who had starred in the previous dramas were called back to play in this new drama unfortunately mark hamill does not play luke and billy dee williams does not play lando but substitutes have replaced them the new luke is more serious but he still serves as a passable luke the new lando also makes a passable imitation of billy dee williams as always the music and sound effects are stunning again and in full surround sound the performances of the actors are wonderful paul hecht again plays the emperor his voice though lacking in the sibilant hiss of ian mcdiarmid does have a distinctly evil quality john lithgo s performance as yoda however was a bit of a disappointment although he is great in the empire strikes back he sounds a great deal more human in return of the jedi his death scene is moving though there is one major flaw in this radio drama the first two plays had ten to thirteen episodes which allowed for a great deal of character and story expansion however return of the jedi only has six some of the scenes such as the destruction of the shield generator the rebel fleet s jump into hyperspace the crash of the super star destroyer executor and the bulk of the battles had to be abridged this drama although not as fulfilling as the previous two is still a wonderful addition to the trilogy it has six episodes each about a half hour long with a total running time of three hours i would most certainly recommend it for people who like swift entertainment instead of the slow but thorough plodding of the first two plays to conclude i think personally that all three of the above mentioned dramas are astounding i would recommend purchasing them all there is a boxed set with all three dramas available for sale however another option is the limited collector s edition which features some extras such as deleted scenes promotional spots by many of the actors music interviews with the cast and a section that features the speeder bike scene without music or sound so we can see how it sounds as it is performed by the actors in the studio this set also features the get well card that was made for brian daley just after the last recording session of return of the jedi although this set is the most expensive it is much more extensive and provides some interesting little tidbits not found in the regular editions i would highly recommend any of these sets 
a bassist s data base tab versus standardthis mostly excellent compilation of over decades of mostly rock songs shows the bassist s part in both standard and tab notation standard requires reading notes tab actually shows the four bass strings and numbers what fret to play next whos in the bookwhile certain schools of funk and soul are slightly underrepresented for my tastes wheres james brown or sly stone were there copyrite issues the book includes some muddy waters howlin wolf marvin gaye smokey robinson martha and the vandellas dancing in the street and the four tops mostly though this is a collection of what is now deemed classic rock eg cream beatles santana stones the who led zep hendrix david bowie the byrds metal bands including black sabbath foo fighters van halen kiss metallica gnr ozzy osbourne s s oldies fats domino elvis the crests candles ricky nelson carl perkins buddy holly and the crickets jerry lee lewis and a smattering of relatively recent last years bands the black crows goo goo dolls stone temple pilots rage against the machine sheryl crow slipknot system of a down there are also some bands that are inexplicably included why are there two songs from power ballad band cinderella but hey to each his or her own only a few songs per groupeach group is represented by one to seven songs only stevie ray vaughn has that many and most range from one to three therefore if you re a big fan of a particular genre or band you might look for a more specialized book however there aren t that many books with bass tab what i like about this bookstrengths of the book include the variety mentioned above a one page decoding of tab symbols the excellent price and song transcripts that generally show the treble clef chord accompaniment and lyrics sometimes you re only shown the or bass sections only and the first few words notes that accompany the riff without the rest of the song who will benefit from this book moderate to advanced players will get the most from the white pages and here s why even with the beginner friendly tab it is still very helpful to know how to read music while tab indicates many of the techniques it doesn t show you the all important left hand finger placement that allows bassists to move smoothly over the neck nor does it easily convey rhythm and the more complex moves unfortunately for the novice many of the songs are at a fast pace and will be too difficult to play ideally you d have the bucks to get a device that will play back slowed down notes from a song without losing their pitch and up ideally in fact you d have a guitar teacher ! but for those without the time money or inclination to go this route this book can get you playing pieces of some real songs a rewarding activity that you won t get from too many beginner bass books recommendationfor this reason alone and again i m speaking to newcomers the white pages can be a useful fun resource particularly when paired with a really excellent instruction book such as bass guitar for dummies you might want to supplement this with bass transcriptions from the internet sometimes from bass interest groups one problem with that however is that tab notations are not always the same the bottom line is that fairly competent bass players will enjoy a lot of transcriptions at a cheap price while novices will have fewer songs they can play all the way through the publisher might have thought to publish or books like this but differentiated by the difficulty speed complexity etc of the bass line 
some useful info and an easy read a sense of humor and sarcasm guaranteed to make you cringe a very limited set of cases mainly it examples and industry references and too many mentions of bill gates are the bad points of this book but all in all i found it useful a sort of business and entrepreneurship for dummies guide highly recommended starting point for those want to become business people but know that their knowledge of business basics is lacking perhaps not so useful for people not in this position sections on compounding and cashflow stick as two of the more useful 
fascinating read it seems that today people are becoming more aware of the danger that hurricanes pose especially after the gulf s devestation from katrina wilma and rita the four hurricanes to strike the florida coast in and now cyclone larry which devestated northern queensland australia hurricanes are becoming a much talked about and even debatable topic of how to prepare track and live with these storms that are now on the rise the reader s of isaac s storm will get a sense that no matter what time period you live in hurricanes prove to be a great threat if not treated with respect and caution this was the deadliest natural disaster to strike the united states many people will say this was because it happened over years ago therefore the technology and warning system was not as advanced but katrina proved this to be wrong while reading this book i was able to pull many similarities from the galveston hurricane and katrina most of the people to have perished in both hurricanes was due to flooding galveston and new orleans are surrounded by a body of water on both sides although many people did not heed the warning in galveston since there was no official warning katrina victims had ample warning and either refused or could not leave the area under certain circumstances erik lawson gives a very detailed account of what had happened that night on september but even before he depicts the magnitute of this atrocity he goes back in time to explain how weather became a science and hurricanes were discovered by man after the storm has passed the author continues to recount the aftermath and the struggle for galveston to revive itself to it s former glory it never has isaacs storm is a fantastic intereting read for anyone who is interested in weather or life altering events if anything you will gain a new respect for hurricanes and it may prompt you to listen and leave if you ever have to face an evacuation

a dr laura avoider i have avoided dr laura her books and her radio program for many years fearing she would say something about me i didn t want to recognize ten stupid things did just that how sad it is that women have such low self esteemthough gangi in her book explains this more as the lack of self lovethat they feel they have to settle for whatever and more importantly whomever pays any attention to them if we would think twice look in the mirror and truly love the person looking back maybe we could lower the count from to or 
iran awakening by shirin ebadi a well written book outling her life at a very turbelent time in iran she is a highly intelligent woman who tackles oppression is a courageous and spirited way iran under the mullahs tried to revert to prehistoric times and basically ruined the country and its society particularily the lifes of women this book proves the indominatability of the human spirit and the ability to come to terms with the most appalling oppression she continued to rear her two daughters in an atmosphere of fear and oppression and still continued her wonderful work for human rights having read the book i believe she richly deserved the nobel prize the book demonstrates that we are all the one spirit and despite geographic religous or cultural differences we are all trying to do our best in living our lives and doing the best for our children life can be a struggle but it is much worse for people living under oppressive regimes in helping to put a face on a muslim we can see that in the extremities of any religion great evil can be perpetrated in the name of a god but the vast majority do not support these extreme views anybody with hawkish views about military intervention should read this book and i believe that if read with an open mind your position may very well change again what it demonstrates to me is that change can only be gradual and countries will eventually change only through the will of its people the problem for iran is that a lot of its best brains are leaving in droves and who can blame them

crime writing at its very best peter robinson grew up in yorkshire and is the author of thirteen previous novels featuring inspector banks he is the winner of numerous awards in the united states britain and canada and in he won the cwa dagger in the library as i also come from leeds the background to his stories is something that i have experienced first hand and because of this i have a special affection for his books however they would be first class crime fiction wherever they were based inspector banks receives a phone call from his brother roy in london something of a novelty in itself but the phone call is quite disturbing and has an air of mystery to it banks immediately leaves his patch in yorkshire and heads off down to the big city to seek out roy meanwhile di annie cabbot is called to the scene of a murder on a quiet stretch of road just outside eastvale a young woman has been found dead in her car the strange thing is that the victim has banks s name and address written on a piece of paper in the pocket of her jeans meanwhile banks is staying in his brothers luxurious but empty house uncovering more and more details about a brother that he never really knew and didn t particularly like up north annie tracks down the female victim s friends and colleagues it seems that both trails are looking likely to intersect at some point and the consequences could be terrifying for both banks and annie 
quotof men amp numbers by jane muir a review this is an enjoyable book i am not a mathematician but came across this book by chance while looking for some specific explanations the book was so interesting and well written that i stopped my research and read it through i would characterize it roughly as a chronological explanation of the lives of the world s great mathematicians it relates their lives and contributions to knowledge to those who lived before and after them the author strikes a very nice balance between explanation of their environment and their contribution to knowledge and its acceptance rejection or being ignored its all nicely woven together the book gave me the feeling of getting just the right amount of detail and explanation with plenty of references for those who wish to study deeper on many subjects covered in the book try it you ll like it end of revie

rotten but loveable of all the books that i read to my son when he was young rotten ralph was one of my and his favorites the artwork is incredible very kinetic and colorful a combination of keith haring and outsider art the story is written with great wit and one can sympahize with the poor heroine trying to get her unruly cat to behave kind of like she s the parent and ralph s the child yeah ralph s behavior is really rotten but sarah loves him anyway sound familiar like maurice sendak s where the wild things are rotten ralph project a child s fears to an imaginary realm where they can be dealt with safely it s a great piece of children s literature 
objective insightful and entertaining book from cochise to geronimo this is a fascinating and well written account of the apache and their war against whites and mexico from the s to their total loss of freedom that ends with geronimo and his final band s surrender and incarceration roberts writes in a very readable and flowing style providing insights and first hand quotes from both sides of the conflicts he also gives you both sides of any controversy particularly letting the reader know the veracity of individuals with conflicting statements which is very refreshing roberts is able to clearly differentiate between the different tribes that were identified generically as apache and he presents a fascinating history involving the many chiefs that led their people during the conflict the author covers extraordinary well the different chiefs and their roles such as the great cochise chokonen mangas colorado chihenne victoria chihenne juh nednhi nana chihenne and of course the infamous warrior geronimo bedonkohe the biographies and retelling of events are so descriptive and thorough that you get a genuine feel for the main characters the conditions of the mountains and deserts and the people white mexican and indian the first chapter starts with lt bascom s ill fated effort to retrieve a child by holding hostages from the wrong tribe cochise s which sets up a violent war against the whites and a distrust that lasts for decades that among several failures such as consolidating reservations and the killing of a medicine man similar to the killing of sitting bull just a few years later substantiates the apache distrust of whites the brutality between parties is evenly told by roberts as women and children suffer during american and mexican attacks on apache villages while the violence towards whites particularly mexicans who the apache loathe is hard to fathom particularly towards the isolated ranchers and their young children and the killing and torture is in extreme brutal fashion fueling hatred and fear among the arizona population one apache explains the violence as emanating from a deep hated associated with the violent deaths of their own people by their enemies perhaps the best example of this is by when a chief eats lunch with his best white friend and then calmly executes him after dinner demonstrating his severance from trusting whites besides the apache roberts covers the agents from the successful but slighted jeffords to the young egocentric clum called strutting turkey by the apache to the various generals that tried their hand in subduing the renegade apache stoneman howard crook and miles the eccentric crook is most successful utilizing apache scouts to go deep into the mountains of the difficult and isolated sierre madre to track geronimo but he is finally undermined publicly by geronimo s frequent escapes and changes of heart thankfully roberts recognizes the role of lt gatewood who finally brings geronimo s band in as the self centered general miles provides gatewood no record of accomplishment at the end roberts provides details on the chirichua s long imprisonment and isolation and geronimo s post capture history he with withstood numerous bullets living to an amazing this is the best book on the apache fight for independence it is an exciting book to read and one of my all time favorites 
how times have changed i am echoing another reviewer in lamenting the sorry state of movie posters in the octopussy campaign from was simply stunning as the myriad posters in this volume show at least different pieces of artwork each one beautifully painted and in keeping with the indian theme the use of octopussy herself as a hindu goddess behind bond was brilliant compare that to the current ad campaign for casino royale which is virtually indistinguishable from a gucci billboard it says nothing about the film its minimalism ill conceived and simply lazy worse still was the die another day poster which was quite simply four layerrs in photoshop pierce and halle a background and the type layer moreover a simple type treatment for the title nothing like the individualized logotype for a film such as octopussy i could go on this is a gorgeous book 
moving story of injustice and imprisonment author bernard malamud won the pulitzer prize for this stunning portrayal of injustice prejudice and false imprisonment yakov bok is a poor jewish handyman from kiev falsely accused of blood libel killing a christian child in order to use his blood to make passover matzos such false charges were not unheard of in eastern europe during periods of anti semitism readers feel as if they are practically beside bok as he sits in prison isolated frustrated and clinging desperately to hope that his innocence will somehow be demonstrated bok must also contend with his previously unhappy life his lack of faith a wife who left him and anger from some inside prison who believe the charges bok s sanity and sturdiness waiver under the stress of his predicament and he struggles to retain his sanity and compassion this powerful tale was partly based on the case of mendel beilis a jew from tsarist russia who was acquitted of the same false charge in after having spent two years in prison this is a superb tale injustice and the mental struggle of an individual to survive the ordeal of false imprisonment

well of course listen this isn t foor some psuedo anarchist looking to piece together a gun from a broom stick a pvc pipe and an aerosol can this is for those who know about basic gunsmithing and have the tools to do so honestly a smg is a complex weapon this isn t like a shotgun which you can make fairly easily or a muzzel loading musket it s complex and on the forefront of firearms technology if you know about guns and have the tools this is an interesting resource but if you aren t knowledgable about gun parts and function and don t have the tools don t bother you ll just be lost honestly complaining you were cheated because he didn t tell you you needed tools to make a sub machine gun i m sorry but some people actually believe in using their brains in purchases so again psuedo revolutionaries should skip this stick to the poorly written anarchist s cook book and leave the real tools to the big boys

a most important book for america s future i read a lot of books and this is one of the most important books i ve ever read it is absolutely packed with facts that very few americans know facts that will probably contribute to what kind of america will exist in the future if we continue our slavish nearly unconditional support for the militaristic policies of israel s likud party it seems likely that we will experience more deadly terrorism and possibly slip into a more authoritarian society not the america you ve come to know and love paul findley was a republican member of congress from abe lincoln s springfield il for years until the israel lobby contributed to his defeat in he became interested in mideast issues by accident doing a service for one of his constituents but as his knowledge grew he stood up for mideast peace in congress until the israel lobby defeated him in he was so popular he won of the votes in his district in the lobby aggressively supported his opponent and he got in dick durbin ran against him with israel lobby support and findley lost by votes but they say what goes around comes around and after his defeat and having seen the dirty smear tactics the lobby used against him he spent a couple of years researching and writing this book it is remarkable that israel supporters one of whose major organizations is the anti defamation league is so practiced at the systematic use of public defamation of those who only mildly disagree with them this book is packed with examples of the hardly believable massive influence the israel lobby has exercised over politics public debate in the media and university campus discussion even mildly critical of israel it is extremely well researched and has a very high signal to noise ratio very little mere emotional rhetoric although findley had considerable difficulty finding a publisher as do all books and articles critical of israel the edition is the third it cites the example of people like charles percy j william fulbright george ball adlai stevenson iii and many others commenting on the stranglehold this lobby has on american policy and discussion about israel the level of this influence will shock you if you read this book that s guaranteed how many of you know how many detrimental events have arguably occurred to america because of our nearly unquestioning support of israel opec s oil embargo the bombing which killed marines in beirut and many more of course the israel lobby would come up with a whole list of clever and devious arguments that these events weren t the result of us support for israel but if you read findley s book you will begin to learn to identify these clever disingenuous arguments a very tiny example of influence can be seen in the one star votes this book has received here on amazon they have no arguments but merely try to bring the rating of this book down it is remarkable that this book has received so many reviews and counting and so many of them are so highly positive read it and prepare to be shocked for additional information on the israel lobby read michael saba s the armageddon network and the scholarly article the israel lobby and us foreign policy by john mearsheimer and stephen walt published in the london review of books and on the kennedy school of government website in

the father of medieval thinking aristotle was in fact a macedonian by birth and had as one of his utmost desires to be accepted in athens as a full fledged citizen something he never attained to be or not a citizen at those times was the determinant factor in the importance each one attained in the social structure one has to keep in mind that all the political concepts that we inherited from the greeks got a different perspective at those times where slavery was normally accepted and practised against the non greeks human beings aristotle was a disciple of plato whom he quotes many times in a derogatory manner and he lived in athens many years after years of tutorship of philip and his son alexander of macedonia to whom he did not mention a word of praise or reprimand in this book what amazed most after reading this excelent book is the maturity the institutions had attained at his times and the degree of accuracy and detail to which he devotes many chapters analysing the constitutions of many greek states sparta included one word of caution has to be addresed to the student of poltics this is not a book about statecraft or the arts of governing people at bc all in all the text seems to lose some strenght due to the impossibity of translating so rich a text and by the lack of precise terms for each and every situation there described but in the end the reader will get a glimpse of this very important period of western civilazation specially if one has in mind that the heyday of greece was gone and what lays ahead was the supremacy of rome as world militar empire to add interest to the reader one has to keep in mind that the powerfull influence the aristotelian thought had in the medieval thinking 
the truth about iraq s history edwin black has done it again placing years of iraqi history into extraordinary perspective reminding us of the truth and revealing the newly discovered facts to create an indispensible chronicle of that troubled land and its relation to britain france and the united states that said the book is really devoted to the last years when the importance of oil sprang upon the world and iraq slowly rose to the top of the western nations agenda as the greatest petroleum source of the new th century black s access to heretofore secret oil company archives and his resurrection of forgotten military accounts reveals that iraq has been desired by the west only for one thing oil this book changed my entire thinking and i highly recommend it for anyone who wants to understand how we got into iraq and whether we can ever get out 
god is not the instigator of trouble in our life but he does make good on his promise to see us through these trails i don t normally do book reviews probably because i m not very good at them but the book i just finished touched me in such a way that i want to share it with all of my fellow writers and book enthusiasts title why the sky is blueauthor susan meissnergenre christian fiction primary reader group womenclaire holland is raped on her way home from the mall if this isn t horrifying enough she finds out she is pregnant claire and her husband dan have two children a daughter katie twelve and a son spencer seven both children came to the marriage after many miscarriages that claire would become pregnant after rape is against all odds if there is such a thing as a blessing in a situation like this the fact claire can t remember the assault is a gift from god this novel delves into the inner feelings of each of the family members as they decide what to do with the baby katie is old enough to understand how the baby came to be but she doesn t want her parents to give it up spencer is too young to realize anything except his mom s belly is growing dan decides he can t love this child and because of this claire agrees to put the child up for adoption the word goes out and a childless missionary couple is picked to adopt the baby now known to be a girl they come to meet the holland family mixed feelings tear claire apart she loves her baby but she doesn t want her raised in a home without a father who truly loves her katie can t understand why they can t keep the baby but bravely she hands the little girl over to rosemary and ed the day the baby and claire are released from the hospital years go by the holland family doesn t speak of the baby named lara they move to another town where dan a veterinarian sinks his teeth into a new practice claire opens a bookstore katie and spencer grow up do all the things kids do but claire never forgets her daughter she prays for her constantly unbeknownst to claire katie now called kate and married with children of her own wonders what has become of her sister one day while claire is away at a business conference a letter comes from rosemary kate doesn t trust her mother to share it with her so she opens it rosemary is dying of cancer she wants the holland family to raise lara now sixteen this book is a study in human emotions i found hard to put down bottom line taken from the book love is not blind it sees more not less but because it sees more it is willing to see less i give this book two thumbs up janice william 
book review i love these books about the professor i listen to them in my car over and over the finer points of sausage doge is also very good about the same professor i would recommend these books on cd for any long car trip they will keep you laughing 
our greatest roadblocks and tragedies are often caused by our misperceptions unfortunately for too many students literature is only as good as the professor who is teaching it some students of literature end up studying it on their own for their own pursoses with no time deadlines and no required number of words essays if you have never seen this play i encourage you to read it and underline it at your own pace quality literature is not intended to be immutable truth sent down from the mountain rather it is a conversation to be continued with future generations in the beginning of the text of the play each character is described the playwright s description of the key role of tom the son sets the stage for unavoidable tragedy the playwright himself suggests the only solution to the social problems raised in the play is to escape from a trap he has to act without pity this foregone preclusion is nonsense the words of this play are beautifully and thoughtfully chosen the play clearly displays tragedies of the female characters who make their personal success dependent on executing a perfect traditional marriage an objective the mother the daughter and the son are not likely to achieve any time soon if ever the play shows what often happens to people who frame their mental success or measure the quality of their soul on whether they can obtain and maintain an absolute singular intimate relationship with only one other person and as with many tennessee williams plays the drama is not so much a result of defective people trying to succeed in healthy social environments and constructs rather the drama the stuff that the theater was created to show is created more when ordinary complex fragile people try to fit into narrow social molds that few people are likely to prosper in amanda laura and tom are worthy of lasting love the tragedy is they have each defined love in different seemingly small but devastating ways and as a result they have blinded themselves to their potential to love each other and find love in others a tragedy in any relationship would be to be with someone who for whatever good reasons stops learning adapting they become someone from whom little new can be learned or expected tom senses those trends in his mother and sister and concludes that neither of them are capable of reconsideration thinking he cannot reason with either of them he incorrectly assumes he is trapped he knows of no method of education to change their mindsets and he tragically abandons them like his father before him tom says i didn t go to the moon i went much further for time is the longest distance between two places and his abandonment leaving them not only for a period of time but more accurately for an indefinite and possibly never ending period of time is a level of insensitivity i doubt he fully conceives because as the playwright says his nature is not remorseless rather more likely he is lacking either the education and or human experiences that would give him a better understanding of the harms his abandoment could cause leaving a poor mother and handicapped hard to employ sister during the depression is not an act that as the playwright himself incorrectly asserts warrants him acting without pity his mother and sister do not need pity they need support education and a determined dogged willingness to find new ideas perceptions and possible solutions i have no problem with tom going off and exploring the world but he doesn t tell his mother or sister when or if he will ever return a decision that is neither necessary nor healthy for him his family or the other people close to him and i don t need to hear tom at the end of the play trying to engender sympathy from the audience for his abandonment by saying he is still haunted by the plight of the sister he left behind to quote the sentiment of a more recent great american playwright if he ever did come back if he ever dared to show his face or his glyph or whatever in the garden again if after all this destruction if after all the terrible days of this terrible century he returned to see how much suffering his abandonment had created if he did come back you should sue the bastard sue the bastard for walking out how dare he that s my only contribution to all this theology tom go home there is great discovery challenge and adventure in working to reconcile the irreconcilable differences in our roots even if you are only partially successful the road less traveled is often the more difficult one leading us back home

a delicate collection i hope that i will be forgiven for saying that as much as i enjoyed this volume of bishop s prose i still don t find it as robust as her poetry while lovely some of these entries were so slight i was afraid to breathe and break them the book is divided into two halves a series of memories and a series of stories i liked the memories section the best particularly the country mouse and her memoir of marianne moore of the stories i liked gwendolyn the best a story about a dying little girl which is not nearly as saccharine as it sounds from that description i enjoyed this book i think i enjoyed it in its own right but if i m honest i m not sure how i would have felt about it had i not already loved bishop s poems so much

an unfathomable america nightmare enter the cult of the salesman s society a salesman needs to dream and lives in a completely fake smiling world when meeting his customers unluckily this alienation because to smile on command is an alienation can invade the salesman s private life and then life becomes a lie becomes a solitude becomes hell and blazes enter the cult of the urban sprawl you may have had a nice house in the middle of some open space but the city grows out and grows up and your house is soon surrounded by skyscrapers and sprawl and you live in a totally dehumanized and cold environment in which sunshine has become a vague recollection fading away with time enter the cult of the oedipian tragedy the father is the dominating boss of the family the bread winner the meaning giver the future designer and definer the sons are zealots of the father and have to follow him in his tracks or at least in what they think his tracks are and trying to preserve his self esteem and illusions by manipulating his ego as if it were a fragile fresh egg of some endangered bird species one will accept the model and the other will find out all this is a lie a fake an illusion but this latter will sink in some kind of maniacal depression that will leads him from one failure to another from one intentional failing procedure to another just to prove to himself and the world his father is great and he is nothing and this will go till he finds the courage to look out and step away once and for all and become himself finally free of the lie or because there is always an alternative till the father decides to step out of life of his family s life which will liberate the horizon and the perspective though it will reveal marvellously how the mother had locked the father into that lie by killing his dreaming power and his enterprising spirit to having a house built paying for the mortgage footing the insurance bill and a few others like the refrigerator s the car s and the washing machine s etc the mother and here the play is extremely misogynistic is the direct representative of the consumer s society that enslaves us to short term needs and evacuates all imagination from this life except when we manage to blow our tops and fly up into the sky of derangement enter the cult of private initiative seen as the only excape from this dictatorial ideology there is always some wild country where you can go and become rich overnight there is always some profession that can only be reached through hard work and heavy studying and in which only knowledge competence and performance will count there is always an outer and an inner frontier that the happy hardworking few will be able to cross and then to come back from enriched and empowered with a vision and a future but woe to those who do not have that vision who do not have that personal force who do not have this special competence who do not have this particular knowledge that gives them the opportunity to become the leaders of the world their local world or the global world or any stage in between these two extremes what comes out of this play is that those who fail in this world only get what they deserve because they are failing themselves and the world by telling tall tales by spreading lies by not seeing that illusions are poisonous to the human mind and yet how hard it is to be imaginative competent self conscious and self righteous compassionate and humane realistic and strong enough to know how to lie in order to save not one s public image but the truth and by the way what is the truth in a society that considers the virtuality of an ever evading potential to be more real than the material reality of an aim killed in our very act of reaching it dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris i pantheon sorbonne

how haiku should have been taught in school this book really helped me as both a reader and writer of poetry through the author i was able to understand the real essence of haiku something that i seemed to have missed when i studied it in grade school this book not only shows where the form came from but how it has evolved over time and through different cultures for anyone who wants to understand the form for themselves either to use it teach it or just appreciate it i highly recommend the book the sections on lesson planning are both interesting and helpful whether or not you want to teach a class !

a filial memoir from what i ve read about chinese culture the ties that bind a family together are one of its strongest and most enforced traditions bound feet and western dress is an interesting memoir for the fact that it does not read like a memoir at all it is the story of a great aunt told to her great niece who mixes in her own observations about her aunt s life and her experience as a chinese american among her narrative bound feet and western dress tells the story of the author s great aunt chang yu i born in yu i was the first woman in her family to refuse to have her feet bound despite being modern in this aspect she is stunted and traditional in her upbringing her education and the way she acts in her first marriage she is famous for having perhaps the first modern divorce in china and is determined to make it on her own from that point on no one in her family truly knows her story until her great niece asks her to tell it what passes between the two of them may not be a ground breaking fascinating story but is rather a quiet reflection on growing up in a changing time yu i struggles through a great majority of her life to be both modern and traditional to do what is right and expected and to do what she wanted to do she is an inspiration to her great niece a first generation chinese american who feels at home with neither nationality the intersections of the author s remembrances of past encumbrances fit nicely with yu is struggle to bridge the past with the new bound feet and western dress offers a poignant look at the role that women have played in china and how they are defining themselves today 
ignore the comics and you ll enjoy the book i was intrigued by the characters and story although some story lines could have been better developed that shortfall resulted in some surprises at the end however i am not a fan of comics so i found the comic strip artwork to be distracting and a bit irritating when i discovered there is a hidden message i went through them all searching for the letters but finally had to give up i will definitely read more of picoult s novels but need to be prepared as the two i ve read are heart wrenching and require a supply of kleenex 
good effort all components are there the story is good the mystery is good too but all together it is slightly below the tops of the series 
butterflies i checked out this book at the library so many times i thought i d better get one of my own found it for the right price at amazon com it s an excellent butterfly book for the novice identifying butterflies of north america 
hitler chose his help well especially with clueless traudl after reading this book and watching the movie downfall its clear to me that traudl junge was pretty much a clueless human being to remain so unknowing throughout her years at hitler s side just strikes me as unbelievable she was offered the cop out excuse that she was so young at the time but i don t think she was that young at all irritatingly clueless but not young its probably one of the reasons that hitler took her on her limited capacity to think beyond her make up this was probably very common in hitler s entourage anyway regarding the book its an interesting read though i have to admit my resentment of traudl s apparant non assessment of what her higher ups were actually doing for nearly three years increased with each chapter i suppose in traudl s case all that is left to be decided in the end was whether she was an emotional cripple before she joined up with hitler or became one afterwards because of it if you read the book and hopefully see the film as well you might understand what i m talking about the movie actually grants her more humanity than her own words do in the book im now inclined to think she went in as a pathetically clueless individual hitler realized this and gave her the job there are a number of good reviews of the book here somehow i only feel inclined to review traudl junge updateafter reading a book about eva braun i have to admit i was a somewhat brutal in my assessment of traudl junge the book was eva braun author nerin e gun paperback pages publisher coronet books new ed edition january language english isbn isbn apparantly hitler did indeed have a way of charming women in those years and it seems that eva and traudl were simply two of many many german european women who found him magnetic the book was written in if you are interested in a very easy but very informative look at hitler s dealings with everyday people in everyday situations i recommend it highly i found it to be much more informative about hitler s non militarypolitical ways than traudl s most likely sanitized version

a solid legal drama deadlock is an exciting legal thriller by one of the best christian authors today james scott bell in deadlock bell tackles the hot button issue of abortion from the political and judicial point of view pointing out just how divisive the issue is to our country millie hollander is a supreme court justice on the verge of being the chief justice when she is hit by a car this experience causes her to question her own beliefs in death the afterlife and god meanwhile senator levering from oklahoma you know this is fiction because there is no way a hard drinking womanizing ted kennady esque senator would ever come from oklahoma is assuring the democratic president that hollander would continue to keep the tenious liberal moderate majority on the court charlene moore is taken on the national abortion lobby with a teenager as a client alleging her client was warned of all the dangers of abortion before she had the procedure senator levering his seedy operative anne deveraux as well as hollander are all great characters who at one time or another have to reconcile their actions with their belief in god this is a great legal novel with solid insights on how the supreme court operates it also has strong relationships at its core and that is what makes it a good novel bell doesn t solve the abortion crisis in this novel but does make it apparent what he believes god is the only way to really solve the problem 
not what i expected i expected yet another basic how to with lots of step bystep instructions and writing exercises none of that is in there but i read it anyway and this book is great the style is conversational and direct one of the best pieces of advice i found was the chapter on ways to fail as a writer such as keep a journal instead the author advocates save your creative energies for paying work having read journaling books i can see the author s point if i only have an hour in a day to write should i journal or work on my novel which one has the potential to result in a check another one write screenplays instead of novels the author again makes an excellent point that writing a novel takes as much time as polishing a screenplay and is comparitively easier to sell so why not write the novel and be paid millions so someone else can write the screenplay theres also some debunking about leading chapters with hooks and ending them with cliffhangers this book is full of very practical real world advice for beginning writers though i d suggest a basic introductory book on the elements of novel writing if you ve a bit more experience and are ready to really roll up your sleeves and produce this book is definitely for you

country bumpkin alternate reality in north america imagine a north america where things in the early s were different how different imagine if the magic and folklore of the native americans had more influence on history what if white man had a different relationship with the natives while they settled the west this is the backdrop for the seventh son alvin is the seventh son of a seventh son a magical thing indeed he is gifted in ways that bring him power but also to bring condescension and exclusion in his town he finds that his knacks may be more than he thinks he is discovering evils that he doesn t understand but knows that he must build things in order to fight those evils that seek to tear down one of my favorite things for an author to do if they do it well is to accent their dialogue with plain talk and bad back country grammar and dialects this really gives grittiness and realism to the story the author s use of historical figures george washington ben franklin e g is somewhat humorous in that they lived different lives that what we came to know in our history classes the political geography is also different with similar names appalachee or irrakwa which give a hint of location or culture but different the underlying conflict which i think is very interesting is one which pits spreading christianity which most modern day americans understand against small magic hexes and spirits this is really the basis of the alternate reality that the author paints in this book since magic is technically a fantasy prop i d consider the alvin maker series to be fantasy in an early american setting hard core fantasy readers may not get into the small time magic that the author presents in this book and series but readers who like what if alternate reality stories will like this book the characters are real dirty and smelly they work hard on the american frontier orson scott card is the author of the alvin maker series of which the seventh son is the first book he has also other science fiction tales such as the ender series and the earth series he also has written a set of three romantic speculative stories of three prominent women of genesis sarah rebekah and rachel

full of valuable insights for managers and scholars alike galbraith has succeeded in filling the gap that he intended to fill in that specific area of management literature where organization theory and international business research interact although i was initially rather skeptical of the scholarly value of the book since it appears to be particularly aimed at practitioners i was pleasantly surprised at the wealth of novel theoretical insights that i was able to extract from it although it clearly builds on galbraith s earlier work for which he is renowned it definitely adds something to the field this book will leave those interested in international business both practice and theory with an enhanced understanding of some of the organizational aspects of the multinational corporation that seem to me to be relatively underresearched 
neglected masterpiece conventional wisdom has it that the firest two thirds of this treatise on character analysis improved psychoanalytic technique focusing on character based resistances rather than just on interpreting content associations dreams etc true enough but the last third which analysts and critics say represents reich s slippage into maddness is even more brilliant and farsighted here reich moves into the area of bioenergy and body based psychotherapy he presages some modern developments in psychotherapy and in many respects moves ahead of where mainstream therapy resides today his bioenergy therapy integration was also a forerunner of much of today s alternative mind body and energy medicine modalities reich was not always the most trenchant writer but here is writing his sharp direct and provocative this is reich s great contribution still largely neglected

good outweigh the not sogood jeffrey ford s the trentino kid starts things off on a slightly creepy note it s about a guy who has frittered his youth away in what he thought was an easier route he s regretting the choices he s made when he comes across a ghost that ll force his hand in a hopefully new direction this is a story that ll resonate with anyone who wishes they had taken a different path years earlier i know it certainly struck a nerve with me tanith lee s the ghost in the clock is atmospheric as is her usual style and features a tale of a clock with a horrific past a ghost and a good dose of madness descriptive writing a creeping sense of unease make this one a chill inducing read the thing about the night just wasn t to my taste too scientific me thinks the silence of the falling stars about a park ranger whom i didn t care for at all didn t work very well for me either i m afraid i can t pinpoint where it went wrong i just found it dull overall gahan wilson s the dead ghost was a short and to the point recounting of an injured man s encounter with an overweight naked ghost i enjoyed this one maybe because it was a nice breather after the previous two stories which i thought were both over long oates subway is a haunting but somewhat familiar story of tragedy and a woman s never ending search for love the seven sisters is a story about formerly grand homes now falling to ruin this one didn t resonate with me in any way and i can t really remember much else about it doctor hood was more accessible the the previous story it s about a woman returning to her childhood home because she s worried about her increasingly distant father it s about loss letting go and features a good dose of ghostbusting i enjoyed the originality of the end of this one an amicable divorce is a story rooted in tragedy and is deeply emotional it s about a man still deeply in love with his ex wife sadly she isn t at all in a good place to return his love but calls him often and begs for help with a creature that is inhabiting their home late at night this one gets under your skin and lives up to the promises made by the editor and despite it s very gloominess was probably my favorite feeling remains is about a young boy whose feminist mom seems more interested in everyone but him after forcing him to care for an aging neighbor who dies he s haunted by the old lady s treasured book of photos this story the neglect of the child and the over thetop selfishness of the mother annoyed the heck out of me the gallow s necklace by sharyn mccrumb was a past coming back to haunt you type of ghost story that was very enjoyable the idea of the gallow s necklace was so utterly chilling it won t be something easily forgotten brownie and m charles grant has always been a difficult read for me his quiet style of horror didn t work for me when i was younger and more into the likes of clive barker poppy z brite but this story about a group of elderly friends who are all experiencing strange haunting phenomena is disquieting in a way that kept me turning the pages or maybe i m finally old enough to appreciate him velocity by kathe koja unlike grant i adored kathe koja s earlier work cipher and the lot even though the style was extremely difficult to get into she was always one of those love em or hate em type of writers who i happened to love i worked my through her books of body modification and love affairs gone sour and always looked forward to more somewhere along the way i lost touch with her work and no longer have patience for the fractured writing style when i try to go back and re read them this story wasn t nearly as difficult as her longer novels but it didn t move me and isn t one i ll remember come tomorrow limbo by lucius shepard is a novella length tale of a former criminal finding love or so he thinks i loved the revenge theme of this one and how it all tied together so nasty like at the end the hortlak by by kelly link is the kind of weirdly quirky short story that i really enjoy it s sort of a david lynch like version of clerks the world has been turned upside down zombie s wander thru convenience stores a strange clerk revels in bizarre pajamas and a woman gives homeless dogs one last glimpse of fun and freedom it s all very strange and doesn t always come together in a cohesive way but i couldn t turn the pages fast enough dancing men by glenn hirshberg is a coming of age innocence lost type of story where one young boy has to face his grandfather s horrific memories of the holocaust this one is a gutwrencher because the horror here isn t of the invented variety though the book contains a few small duds the majority of the stories were genuinely creepy 
one of the best adult comics ever the second installement of the volume preacher series garth ennis hellblazer punisher and steve dillon punisher supreme power nighthawk has out done themselves again in this book it s even better than the first vol gone to texas this tpb is seperated into two story arcs the first all in the family tells us of jesse custer s troubled past in annville and why he left tulip five years ago and he also meets some familiar but unwanted faces this story arc introduces jody and t c hitmen that work for jesse custer s dredded grandmother who can be summarized as an evil ugly old hag the second story arc is about cassidy being taken by a powerful organization called grail and introduces herr starr hoover and featherspoon alot of sex and bizzare moments in this story arc anyways the main plot of the whole series is about jesse custer looking for god literally that s because according to this book god left his job and quits and jesse isn t just gonna just let god leave he s gonna give him a peice of his mind as if that s not enough this book also say that maybe jesus faked his death and ressurection this book is bound to offend a lot of people especially catholics and christians but then again i m a christian and i feel fine with it but that s just me lots of violence as usual the jokes are over the top a lot of sex and arguably the best adult comic out there today garth ennis basically an insane but genious irish writer is one of the best comic writers out there and he continues to surprise his faithful readers with his trademark bizzareness and dark humor he does some of the best work here in until the end of the world lets not forget the art by steve dillon ennis s partner in crime his work in the tade paperback is superb great details especially in depicting faces and expression and insane art when drawing the trademark gruesome violence of ennis and dillon he doesn t hold back its unbelievable how great these two gentlemen are but they ve definitely out done themselves this time but if you can be offended by excessive violence nudity and sexual themes profanity or just plain bizzareness then don t even think about getting this book but if you are not my friends then you better go get a copy now and be ready to be disturbed and entertained 
pretty good i m a big clay fan and from the reviews i thought this would be a bit better it was well written but was a bit on the religious side i found myself skimming thru that stuff clay has had an interesting life and some of the stories about his birth and step father made me a little sad they seem like real jerks and didn t understand what a wonderful child they had in their family if you are a clay fan you will most likely enjoy it it s a fast read a bit all over the place at times but worth the few hours it takes to complete clay truly is an amazing human being there should be more young people with his sized heart

colorful and well written on one hand this is a product manual hyping what toys in babeland sells but it is also a great example of sexual information made fun and readily available the photographs are excellent and well laid out so the book is pleasing visually the information is well written and well researched with opinions back by experience and facts contrary to the store s name there is not just toys and information for women there are also nice little stories about how the store has affected people s lives both customers and workers i just wish the resource list was longer 
great insight it is amazing that two people can read the same book and extract dramatically different concepts i do not believe that this book was written as a source of doctrine and theology but rather a perspective of an individual his experience and the wisdom he gained not all men may have experienced what he addresses for those of us who have this book has assisted in bringing us into a closer relationship with god my primary source of knowledge and help come from his word but i am grateful to people like john eldredge who are able to verbalize and assist those of us not steeped in doctrinal theology to develop a closer relationship with god

virginia is for lovers of history what an excellent book ! the last i knew fischer was working on a big book concerning plantation life in the south and i assume this is a book that developed out of the research he is doing for that book this book concerns migration from britain to virginia migration within virginia and then migration from virginia to other states most of the book deals with the s up until just before the civil war i can t do justice to all the interesting information that is in this book during the course of a brief review the authors explain how people migrated from different parts of britain and settled in different areas of virginia for example people from northern england and the scottish border area tended to settle in southern virginia they brought their customs with them which tended to make southern virginia different from other areas settled by different people for instance the tidewater area was settled by younger sons of the english nobility these people came over to virginia because under english law they were not going to inherit estates back home as the first born sons had that right different speech patterns developed in different areas as well as different ways of cooking and different forms of architecture etc the book also deals extensively with the lives of slaves and the institution of slavery and how the mass migrations out of virginia involved many many slaves being taken to other states with their masters or being sold when the virginia tobacco based economy began to falter in the late s the sale of slaves to settlers in other states was a great source of income to the white people in virginia who had fallen on hard times many famous people had ancestral origins in virginia such as lincoln henry clay stephen austin sam houston and general patton amongst countless others there are many firsthand accounts quoted in the book from the settlers so you get a real feel for the times and there are a number of wonderful black and white photos also this short book is packed with fascinating details thank you mr fischer and mr kelly 
life changing timeless as relevant now as what it was when it was written addresses the issues of hate and indifference and argues that the solution is love love does sound all too simplistic but it is one of the hardest things to face but its rewards are beyond words 
the theological discourses of john donne jeffrey johnson by means of a serious erudite and documented work portrays the religious writings of john donne as texts fruit of a well founded knowledge of christian theology in which the author elaborates rejects and innovates the discourses of religious dispute of his days to consider donne as a full fledged religious thinker with a personal theological structuring of the christian creed is the first pioneering step taken by donne scholarship to propound a more compelling understanding of his sermons and religious poetry johnson s methodology a la skinner contextualizes the single thinker in his cultural matrix and thencewise proceeds to elucidate the ways in which he used and reacted the religious thought of his time this book given the heavy theological contents is useful primarily for renaissance scholars and students who want to get a feel of the complexity and seriousness of donne s sermons localizing them in their context and perceiving them as answers to the theological problematics of the time 
good improvement from last edition this is the book that i used to teach comparative vertebrate anatomy the previous major flaw of the book was the many inaccuracies in the figures however many of these appear to be changed all in all this book is a good book to reference to for a variety of questions about vertebrates not the easiest of books to wade through for a beginner but kardong for the most part does a good job in explanations and descriptions for a book of this leve 
good reference mr book this a book that can help you understand how mental ray works the tutorials are easy to follow some take sometime to render specially when rendering the final images but that s obvious since mental ray it s very computer intensive the author covers pretty much every shader of mr there s an explanation of each one a simple tutorial to follow and understand what the parameters alters the render also covers indirect illumination using gi and fg used alone and together the only part that i didn t like is the tutoria of caustics by reflection after completing the render they didn t look realistic as i was hoping but as in almost book out there there are things to do by yourself and do trial and error renderings until you get the result that you like so if are new to mental ray this book can help you out on understanding this powerful render engine how it works what it can do what things need to be considered before applying shaders the author made a book that s easy to read lots of pictures of reference in full color so there s no way you can get lost while playing with the parameters within max 
real scientists confront creationists as this book does so well this book is an excellent resource that helps get to the bottom of the fallacious reasoning of the psuedo science movement the creationist movement in particular every chapter is well written and superbly informative the authors are well accredited and right on target on the topics they address the book deals with some very basic fallacies of the creationist movement not necessarily attacking god believers but militant young earth creationists and other opposers of evolution a lot has developed in the id movement since the writing of this book more resources are handy but the material here is priceless and needed knowledge to any person who champions true unadulterated science over the bad excuses that try and pass for it in this turbulent time when everyone is trying to bootleg nonsense into our colleges and public schools jhwwwministerturnsatheistor 
excellent for excercises this book has tons of exercises ! if you are looking for the encyclopedia of bodybuilding exercises this is it i have tried arnold s guide but found this one much better for exercise form and variety it even talks about potential for injury in some exercises the illustrations are very good and somewhat easy to follow the book is organized in sections by body part and the exercises are rated by difficulty there is a very informative section on eating and health too this book was obviously created for weight trainign focusing on the bodybuilder there is a section on posing and history on a couple great bodybuilders pearl doesn t try to go overboard on the motivational stuff either short sweet and to the point this is a very good manual and reference for anyone who wants to build their own program or is very interested in bodybuilding sculpting using the thousands of exercises in this book you will be able to work all angles of all muscles the only reason i gave it instead of five stars is that the book does not give much startup information for beginning bodybuilders as far as how much weight to start out with stretching and lack of illustrations of some basic exercises that new wieghtlifters may not be familiar with getting stronger also by bill pearl is actually the book i used when i started lifting years ago and it covered those basics for the experienced however keys to the inner universe is an outstanding manual ! between the two you will not need a third book on weight training 
among the finest histories of the nazi era the order of the death s head first published in was written while the dust had not yet settled on world war two and at years of age hoehne s work is a historical classic of the nazi period as with albert speer s inside the third reich and shirer s the rise and fall of the third reich this is one of those quintessential works of the period focusing on the rise and actions of the german ss this book certainly does not glorify the ss or the nazi party while providing a near exhaustive record the work while still very useful is still quite flawed in its organization and is by no means complete the majority of the work focuses on the origins of the ss and the early nazi party as well as later actions as a political entity and finally discusses the ss involvement with concentration camps while discussed the combat actions of the waffen ss are but an aside to the greater focus of the work and many significant happenings within nazi germany are discussed quickly while others that may seem less significant are given substance this book is an excellent though incomplete resource that is well written and receives both benefit and disadvantage from the period in which it was written building up the scene hoehne discusses at great details the ideal and actions of the early nazi party and the formation of the schutzstaffel ss filled with interesting detail and anecdote this is perhaps the richest portion of the work as the work progresses hoehne discusses the interaction of the ss with the other part organizations including the sa the party itself and later the wehrmacht sd and gestapo here we see a central theme of hoehne s work the power of the nazi party rested solely in hitler and all of the party organizations were dependent on hitler and a few of his staff thus the ss as pervasive as it had been was always just one organization in an interdependent and often redundant network that comprised the political structure of nazi germany the work goes on with continuing sporadic detail to discuss the night of the long knives the gestapo kristallnacht the early war occupation of eastern europe and the concentration camps this last subject the author provides lucid descriptions and many grim and overwhelmingly bizarre instances this work is certainly among the most influential and resourceful works on the third reich along with the other two books mentioned above the average person can get a pretty good understanding of a most bizarre era of history no one of these books is complete and certainly there are many things completely ignored in all three of these books the fact remains that order of the death s head is still one of the finest and most complete books written about the ss it makes a great point of departure for studying the ss and will be a work that the historian will reference often the book is also well researched and has a great bibliography overall i would recommend this book to college students and above and may want to be prefaced by a little basic th century german history if needed otherwise this book is a good record however casual readers be warned the book may be confusing do to its lack of chronological ordering considering that this book was written before the dust settled on the era and an historical consensus was just beginning to form on the nazi period this is a very worth work that all interested parties ought to read ted murena 
a most helpful and comprehensive book i loved the easy toread style of the book loved it so much i ve begun reading other books within the series of quoteverything you need to know quot i m a history major and i ve learned a lot from the book about all the various asian immigrant groups that have arrived in the u s i ve read lots of other history books also and although they confirm the historical events and facts i got from this book i found that those other books are just much harder to get through this book is intended on purpose it s clear to be a popular type of book and has no pretense of being some type of quotmajor research quot book it s fun it makes one wants to learn more about history and so one does i think it s really very worthwhile i can read it on trains in between classes even recommend highly 
very dramatic and somewhat disturbing tale of survival but this book is missing something it has plenty of drama interesting sidebars but i think a lot of it was rambling and hemmingway didn t know where he was going with it nevertheless the tale of harry morgan s struggle to keep his family fed in corrupt key west is interesting the dialog is powerful particular in the bar scenes and hemmingway s style of direct prose writing is entertaining you will feel the pain of the characters in this difficult story 
not a picture book a nice introduction and more to native plants of the pacific northwest my only criticism about it is that it doesn t have great photos i bought this book to give me an intro to plants in that area as i m designing a garden for a friend this book doesn t give much sense of what the plants look like in a garden i ll have to go there it s comparable to judith phillip s book southwestern landscaping with native plants for obviously a different part of the country

well worth wading through this large but highly readable work covers the history and context of emerging or re emerging communicable diseases affecting the world today as a physician with a masters in public health i could appreciate the challenge this author faced in presenting this complex and important topic she has made remarkably few minor technical errors while presenting fields as diverse as virology immunology and disease ecology in a clear and compelling manner she places the emerging diseases in the social economic and political context that helps to explain why diseases occur where and when they do and why and how they impact individuals and societies although the jacket copy seems to imply a sensationalized account the story the author tells is a balanced and highly professional one in a world grown ever smaller and more tightly connected the issue of communicable disease and public health will impact all our lives and deserves the attention of every citizen 
cross over book of the year death can hardly be a reliable narrator neither can death be warm and fuzzy and heartbreakingly earnest death can hardly be a funny and loving narrator that will not do will it but that is just what markus zusak s narrator does in his tender tale of growing up loving books and finding oneself all in the heartless world of nazi germany liesel meminger a year old girl and her brother are sent by their mother to live with foster parents but on the way tragedy strikes and the young boy dies the mother lost but the young girl forges on picking up the one thing lying next to her dying brother a book the first stolen book by an illiterate young girl at her new parents place a seemingly gruff brutish mother who adoringly calls her saukerl swine and a gentle accordion player dreamer of a father liesel clings on to life goes to a school and makes friends with the roguishly charming rudi steiner a boy arrogant and stupid enough to apply coal allover his face in the midst of swirling aryan pride and pretend to be jesse owens as he runs like the wind their blissfully innocent childhood is slowly threatened by the jingoistic bigotist nazis and he sudden arrival of a jew who must be hidden in liesel s basement there are few unpredictable moments in the narrative forewarned as we are by death s announcements at the beginning of the chapter he doesn t like twists and nasty surprises for they are cheap and vulgar so right at the beginning of the chapter you will know who dies lives and does what death knows that it is not what happens but how that makes a story the book thief has its false moments yes this book is a bit too melodramatic a bit too doe eyed it is far too earnest a story but liesel is an admirable heroine one we will love and cherish death is the kind of narrator you will choose for your own biography he is warm and tender and hates his job war is like a new boss always expecting the impossible liesel s parents are the kind of loving couple that we all wish we knew rudi is the friend we all want to be but what it all comes down to is this it s hard not to fall madly in love with a book that earnestly believes in the redemptive quality of books

great business person s book of networking buying this book was the smarted business investment i have ever made if you are a business person needing to understand your technical team s conversation about your computer network then this book is for you it allowed me to be able to understand networking problems and opportunities that affect my business before i read this book i was not able to intelligently make purchase decisions about technical equipment or services that my it department would recommend since reading this book i can now hide the fact that i am not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to technology

best if you know brazil well i read this book in portuguese when it first came out in brazil and i absolutely loved it this book is not only about caetano veloso and his music caetano veloso has a very unique way to see people and to write about them and in his life he had the privilege to meet some of the most important people in brazil s cultural scene in his book he tells us many precious stories about chico buarque de hollanda gilberto gil nara leao paulinho da viola and so many others some important moments of his life and also of brazilian history are also told from a very personal point of view stories of caetano and gil s prison and exile during brazilian dictatorship were specially moving to me and then there are some fabulous stories about the beginnings of caetano s carreer how it all started caetano has such an insteresting point of view about everything it s awesome to be able to get inside his mind and that s how i felt reading his book i actually ended up reading it twice i think though that this book can be better appreciated by people who really know brazilian music and culture well another reviewer mentioned that caetano talks about lots of obscure artists but i don t think this is a true statement he talks about very important people in brazilian culture including writers film directors and musicians the people he mentions are very known in brazil and he also talks about important european and american artists the people he mentions in his book are not obscure at all probably if you know who he is talking about it makes for a much better reading experience so if you have a curious mind and are interested in art music and brazil this is certainly a wonderful book to read and like me you may want to read it more than once

katha is definitely correct pollittically since i subscribe to the nation i d read almost all of these before but they are especially good in book format where one gets her consistent voice as she isn t merged and sometimes lost in the mental jumble of all the reports and comments in a given nation issue for potential purchasers readers let me offer a couple of wonderful samples to tempt you some states california among them have conscience laws permnitting anti choice healthworkers to refuse to be involved in abortions and some pharmacists refuse to provide the morning after pill but imagine if a jehovah s witness nurse refused to assist with a blood transusion or a muslim bank loan officer refused to charge interest or a southern baptist psychotherapist told jewish patients they were going to hell the family research council says that every frozen embryo should have an opportunity to be born so concerned women of america give a frozen embryo the gift of gestation mona charen ann coulter it isn t enough to write columns comparing stem cell research to tearing transplantable organs out of freshly killed prisoners you could be leading the way frozen embryo rescue would also be an interesting project for the sisters of life the anti choice order founded by the late john cardinal o connor sort of a virgin birth kind of thing

spare the rod it s been said spare the rod spoil the child these days with the new gen kids ! sorry not very true but no spanking ! playing pranks and making mischief as a child is really tons of fun but every kid needs a code of conduct a discipline to adopt behavior patterns and possess self control children need to be taught to pause and think of the consequences that may result from their various behaviors it is critical for educators to model self discipline younger children tend to throw tantrums be rigid stubborn have sibling rivalry be possessive etc and these are the trial times for the parent to tackle firm where situations demand disciplinary action in this book instead of spanking the authors effectively provide measures to cope up in situations when its hard to draw the line with their loving kids the flash card approach is a plus point verbal spanking is an option to spank the kid words said in loving way clear and firm voice would have its effect than abusing word war the book says all about practical suggestions to adopt and check those flaws in kids for their own good without spanking the child by controlling own words and actions parents demonstrate to their kids a healthy way to react to stress a good pick for young parents should say

the wright brothers taught the world to fly without question but who taught the wrights tom crouch has been a friend and colleague of mine for some fifteen years so i am not necessarily unbiased in my assessment of his work but i think you will find that a dream of wings is the best description and analysis of the pre history of flight in america up to the time of the wright brothers that has ever been written crouch concentrates on octave chanute samuel p langley otto lilienthal and others in the pre wright era who steadily moved toward the objective of controlled powered sustained heaver thanair flight most important crouch shows that the wright brothers did not work in a vacuum they were part of a cadre of serious investigators who worked diligently to solve the practical problems of flight he rightly notes that a cooperative well directed flight research program involving many men with broad technical experience made possible the success of the wrights at kitty hawk p rescuing this community of researchers from obscurity is the most important contribution of a dream of wings the hero of a dream of wings is octave chanute a french born chicago based engineer who explored the challenge of flight in gilded age america his personal investigations into the problems of flight measurably advanced knowledge about powered flight in the s and he shared that knowledge with the wrights as they undertook the research that led to their successful test flights the brothers corresponded with chanute throughout their preliminary research seeking his counsel and incorporating his ideas into their designs for an airplane once successful chanute even visited the wrights at kitty hawk north carolina while they were testing their planes not until at age did chanute begin a second career by devoting himself to solving the problems of flight in typical engineering fashion of step bystep investigation chanute assembled all known data on the science into a single synthesis and catalogued its problems very early he began building a community of researchers organized symposia and served as the central clearing house for information on the subject crouch tells this story exceptionally well in this book and he holds up chanute s approach as a model in collegial engineering as opposed to the proprietary approach taken by most corporations chanute deeply believed that the advancement of flight science must be the work of many he corresponded internationally and encouraged the pioneers including the wright brothers of whom he was a special friend and mentor he sought no patents on his inventions and gave his findings openly to all the wright brothers used his research when they designed their aircraft chanute for instance advised wilbur wright to find a sandy place with strong prevailing winds to lessen the problem of landing and of moving the vehicles from the point of landing back to the point of takeoff this sparked the brothers decision to journey from their native dayton ohio to kitty hawk north carolina where the conditions chanute recommended existed nearly year round no one proved a more effective advocate for the wright brothers after their famous first flight than octave chanute and crouch tells this story as well chanute steadfastly supported the brothers and remained their confidante until patent disputes erupted over aeronautical technology chanute broke off his correspondence with them at that time because he disagreed with their desire to control the technology of flight for him technical information was a public commodity and he believed that the ability to fly would usher in a new age of enlightenment that the wrights were thwarting the relation was mending when chanute died in and the brothers attended his funeral wilbur wright delivered his eulogy this is a very fine history of the quest for flight with usch characters as octave chanute center stage in the effort to create practical airplanes i commend it to all interested in the development of flight in america 
gore s best book i could not put this book down i heard gore read a section at the mamagathering in la this summer i bought a signed copy from her at her table and started reading the book that evening the other reviewers are right that the book is part memoir and part travel story if you are looking for something different and compelling read this book 
good supplementary book on negotiation the book is very well structured and extremely readable with real case problems it starts off with the big picture of negotiation leads to specific points and includes toward the end a lot of quotpeople skills quot likes social dilemmas or different cultures the book is neately structured with a great conclusion at every chapter quantitative support is used only where necessary and therefore kept to a minimum i recommended as a supplementary book to getting to yes still my all time favourite or the art and science of negotiation for the very serious student 
simplicity in form for everyone who thinks they have creative ability this is simply the book to read this book is slowly but surely transforming and discipling me to become better at writing i only hope that a year from now i have made a decent and forthright attempt in using these skills 
a tough to digest enthralling work the mother of a monthold baby girl who spent the first weeks of her life in the nicu at a nyc hospital i took this book very seriously i admit that my paranoia has flared up many times in the first year of my daughter s life always hearing about the risks and potential problems that preemies face it s hard to avoid it though she seems to be caught up and healthy i often wonder if there is something lurking behind her blue eyes that i won t discover until she s older something that will immobilize her me our family something that cannot be controlled with tough love or time out type punishments while there is no sign of any such problem i cannot seem to fully accept the fact that she is and will be a normal child teen adult i have spent so much time fretting and imagining worst case scenarios that i wonder if i could be willing her to have some kind of abnormality or if my own negativity and insistence on surrendering to my worst fears will ultimately become her cross to bear will i be a smothering parent who is too afraid of the what ifs to allow my child the chance to grow up unencumbered by an over protective mother i read and i don t want to live this life over a weekend which for me is a quick turnaround considering that i am a working mother of a baby girl and part time step mon to a yearold true to tradition my husband sometimes makes me feel as if i ve got three kids instead of two so finding the time to get through a substantial read can be challenging but this is not the type of work that can simply be cast aside and left untouched for more than a few hours at a time every time that i found myself with a few mintues to spare i would grab the book and delve right back into the story of the spungen family engrossed to the nth degree until some calamnity like a broken toy or a spilled glass of milk called my attention away from it one particularly long read came when my daughter was napping on sunday afternoon and my husband and ss were playing catch in the yard i spent a good minutes reading but stopping at times to try and recall if any of the symptoms that nancy exhibited as a small child were mirrored by my own daughter nancy didn t like to be held or touched my natalie refuses cuddling of the time nancy was aggressive and unloving as a child natalie often swats at me when i try and feed her some unwanted food or when she s tired and i attempt to distract her from a nap because it s too close to bedtime for that every so often my husband would stick his head in from the yard and ask what i was doing then see me reading and say something like i hope you aren t doing it again he knew the subject of the book and knew what i was thinking because i had already asked him more than once since saturday morning if he thought that natalie might have some sort of behavioral issues always his answer was no she s a normal child stop trying to find something wrong with her and every time he said it it calmed me and convinced me and i continued on grateful that i could remain empathetic to deborah s plight but stay safely in the parents of healthy kids club and then sure enough minutes later i would feel some of that confidence fade and again i would look up from the page and wonder my god does natalie do that too but the difference between deborah and myself is that once her child was my daughter s age she never wondered about nancy without already knowing the answer she dreaded yes there is something wrong despite the staggering ineptness of the medical community at the time despite the experts who told her time after time that nothing was wrong she knew that they were off base she knew that normal children did not act like nancy did it wasn t hyperactivity it was adhd it wasn t inpatience or normal aggression nancy wasn t a spoiled brat it was neurological chemical and untreatable by boundary setting and infliction of punishments it is a mother s worst fear to face the knowledge that her child won t be normal won t function on their own without major difficulty won t have normal relationships with other people to know that the child you so love and care for will not know the extent of that love for their own child because fate has simply not allowed for such is unbearable what if your child will never live without knowing major emotional or physical turmoil never see the sun and feel anything but the burn of its heat never touch a flower without fretting over its thorns perhaps they will never love us their parents either maybe the compacity will just not exist every parent knows exactly what deborah spungen feared and can understand how difficult it would be to embrace the truth how much she must have wanted to believe the incorrect diagnosis time after time what do you do when no one will help your child help your family how to you soldier on when you know that the black clouds are an indefinite intrusion when there is not a single thing you can do but wait and watch for the end of a life that once had so much promise so much hope and so much love to fade into the eternal blackness of night this book is truly a must read for any parent who has worried about their child i guarantee that it will touch you after all the most successful stories are filled with characters who regardless of personality traits or geographic location or even time period are relatable in some way and deborah spungen and her family exemplify the sympathetic protagonist s perfectly i would even concur that nancy s schizophrenia which i believe was the cause of her plight acted as the antagonist instead of nancy herself nancy s murderer was not sid it was her disease the accomplices were the doctors that refused to diagnose her the therapists that turned their backs the headmasters that should never have held their positions had this child been born decades later nancy would have been properly medicated observed by a psychiatrist and considering her supportive family and their the financial means lived the most normal life that a person afflicted with such a disease is capable of the relationship with sid vicious the terrible drug addiction the inability to function would never have come into play it forces the question how many other children grew up like nancy having suffered some sort of brain damage at birth or in utero and were left misunderstood misdiagnosed and mistreated how many of the murderers serial killers abusers other such criminals that have been made infamous by their crimes were nancies how many of their victims would still be living unscathed at this very moment had their predators not been mishandled by an ignorant society to be fair parts of spungen s book did induce a raised eyebrow particularly when she named nancy outright as the cause of her infidelity the stress and loneliness that spungen must have suffered as the primary caregiver of a difficult child is no doubt harrowing however to put all responsibility for such a disloyal act against her husband on nancy s shoulders only exacerbates the mistreatment she suffered as a result of behavior that she was unable to control i also felt at times that spungen and her husband disregarded the mental health and general well being of their other two children by allowing nancy to control the household at an age where said children were too young to understand what was truly going on i cannot say that i have the solution but the pain and confusion that susan and david surely endured as young people surely has had a substantial effect on them but again what do you do with your child when no one will help you understand how to deal with him how do you turn your back also about halfway through the book as spungen realizes that her daughter is fast approaching the point of no return regarding her deteriorating personality she often begins to express her wish to get the old nancy my nancy back however although i don t doubt the sentiment i can t say that she made it clear when writing the early part of the book that she ever felt close to or accepting of much about nancy at all sure it s implied through her pain and determination that deborah s love for nancy was immeasurable but i do wish she has been more willing to share some of the early closeness and relationship with nancy that she suggests later on did exist as someone else mentioned the title of this book is something of a misnomer as the majority of the work deals with nancy s life from birth to adolescence and only the last small chunk addresses her relationship with sid and her murder i would not recommend this book to someone who is simply looking for more literature on the s punk rock scene or of the infamous sid and nancy pairing and i don t want to live this life is the story of a child s undiagnosed mental illness and the journey of pain that the entire spungen family was forced to take courtesy of an untreated case of schizophrenia and the ignorance of a medical community 
good overview of the history of some languages tore janson s speak is a succinct readable overview of the history of languages focusing primarily on english and western languages this is a well written informative book janson starts by giving a brief overview of the development of languages including mentioning one of his major themes of the book a language is only a language if its speakers recognize it as such he then traces the history of the mesopotamian languages greek latin and then the modern european languages finally devoting a chapter to english s current dominance in the world finally janson concludes with a short chapter on the possible future development of languages john mcwhorter s power of babel is the only comparable book that i have read mcwhorter is a little more entertaining and explains the actual dynamics of language change better but janson s story is more structured linear and complete this book is a good overview of the history of language for a layman 
the avengers start off storming olympus and end up fighting the defenders there are some big names that show up as writers and artists in the issues collected in essential avengers volume but they do not show up for long just like the roster for marvel s premier superhero team the lineup for writing and drawing this comic book changed a lot an original story by harlan ellison s five dooms to save tomorrow is adapted in while roy thomas finished as writer of the book with issue and then steve englehart took over barry windsor smith draws the first three issues here even doing some of the inking along with joe sinnott and syd shores for and then we get rich buckler john buscema george tuska jim starlin don heck and bob brown the avengers line up at the start of this collection consists of captain america thor iron man quicksilver the scarlet witch and the vision with rick jones hanging around because he is sharing space with captain marvel by the end hercules the black panther hawkeye and the swordsman and his paramour mantis show up for duty as well although everybody who has ever been an avenger shows up for as the avengers assemble and invade olympus because ares the god of war has been causing trouble on earth the ellison story has to do with killing innocents whose descendants will destroy the world before we move on to more traditional super villain tales as the avengers hit issues it is the vision who is the key member of the group and he has to deal with his brother the grim reaper before alone and in tandem with the space phantom while the romantic relationship between the vision and wanda continues its stormy way unfortunately there are a lot of issues focusing on hawkeye who comes back quits and joins the defenders i never cottoned to hawkeye and never was enamored of the green arrow either and even in retrospect he is at best a light proto type version of wolverine think about it there are also several issues dealing with evil mutants and other characters from the x men first the sentinels show up followed by lorelei and then magneto of course wanda and pietro were original members of the brotherhood of evil mutants so there is that history to justify it all and it does make for something different the problem with a super group is that it is so hard to come up with a group of villains for them to fight so you have to go with one supervillain such as magneto who is arguably stronger than any one hero which makes you wonder what happens when cap iron man thor etc has to deal with somebody one ononecollected in this volume are avengers daredevil and defenders so there are some cross overs that involve not only daredevil who is teamed up with the black widow at that point and the newest at that time marvel super group this clash was interesting because what happened was members of each group met in mini battles the vision and the scarlet witch vs the silver surfer iron man vs hawkeye the black panther and mantis vs dr strange swordsman vs the valkerie captain america vs sub mariner and in the last but not least position thor vs hulk which is when the two groups finally get together to go after the evil tag team of loki and dormammu the problem with the avengers is that the comic book never really seemed to jell and it was always one step forward and one step back if buckler had stayed as the artist for most of these issues i could round up but don heck was probably my least favorite marvel artist during that time and i look at any title he was drawing as being second tier at best 
rate the book not the arguments it amazes me how many of the previous reviewers failed to review the quality of the book translation print etc but rather insisted on offering sophomoric critiques of kant s arguments no one cares what you think about kant if one day you make even a fraction of a contribution to the field of philosophy as kant has then and only then may your opinion be considered important to the discussion any idiot can have an opinion it is the task of scholars to first understand save the opinions of kant s arguments for your dissertation now for my review i gave stars mainly for what i felt were a few discrepancies or at least ambiguities when compared to the german text as for english translations i personally prefer the translation by james creed meredith nevertheless it is always helpful to have several translations for comparison 
this book has changed my life this is truly one of the most wonderful books i have ever read ! being a person who has struggled with self doubts agonized over making decisions questioned many of my choices and worried about not doing everything absolutely perfectly this book has been life changing for me for many years i have been very focused on self improvement and have been in search of the answers and the right paths for me i have looked for these answers in hundreds of self help books and many other places thanks to gail i now truly understand and believe that the answers have been within me all this time ! although i know that the work i ve done in the past including counseling journaling talking with friends family reading other books etc has all helped me a great deal it has always seemed that there was something missing i still felt lost and confused in many ways i truly believe this book was the missing piece ! gail gives structure and clarification to some things that i at least somewhat knew but couldn t completely verbalize understand or incorporate in my life she has helped me to see that i just needed a little help and guidance in getting in touch with the voice of my heart and my higher self which i ve now been able to do the timing of my finding this book absolutely amazes me and i swear it powerfully changed and improved my life almost immediately i am now recommending it to everyone i know both women and men gail is so completely open honest supportive encouraging helpful and beautifully spiritual i like that it s not a religious book per se but spiritual in a very gentle and loving way and i love that gail not only explains the ideas and truths but also gives journaling guidance prayers affirmations and ideas for ceremonies to help the reader truly incorporate the ideas and truly change her his life i am so thankful to gail for sharing herself and her insights with the world thanks to her book i feel happier more confident more at peace and more in touch with who i really am than ever before i highly recommend this book to all with all of my heart 
memory lane ellynanne geisel s book apron chronicles evoked all the scents and comforts of my s childhood a time before microwave meals and premixed desserts as i read through each story i mentally returned to the home of my youth and happily basked in a time that was simpler loving and warm each storyteller as realisticly captured by photographer kristina loggia looks like they paused long enough in their daily activities to recall and reflect on a simple piece of their past and then returned to their tasks at hand i felt as if i had stopped by their homes for a short visit and was warmly welcomed much like an old acquaintance perhaps it was the innate hospitality of the aprons this is a book to peruse slowly much as you would geisel s exhibit to hurry through would be to shortchange the nostalgic experience 
amazing stuff this is a wonderful book ! inspiring to adults as well as children of all ages and even got me painting again ! peter reynolds has done it again with another magical publication i have bought copies of this book and given it to all my friends no household should be without one 
thrilling and dark sci fi i finally got around to reading the book jurassic park by michael crichton paleontologists dr alan grant and dr ellie sattler chaos mathematician dr ian malcolm and lawyer donald gennaro are invited by hammond to his resort island off costa rica to their astonishment they discover that hammond and his ingen corporation using fossil dna supercomputers and gene sequencers have been able to clone dinosaurs at the jurassic park the group is also joined by hammond s grandchildren tim and lex murphy they all set out on a park ride to check out the dinosaurs when all hell breaks loose the story in the book is deeper darker and much different than the movie i hadn t expected this the book is just as nailbiting as any crichton book and i ended up being awake until am and yet another weekend sleep went down the drain malcolm with his chaos theory ramblings is highly entertaining there are more varieties of dinosaurs introduced in the book than in the first movie crichton s books always have some smartass way of division into sections this book is divided into iterations with each one slowly progressing to form a fractal accompanied by malcolm s quotes alluding to the same the underlying message of the book is that genetic engineering without careful understanding of the consequences can be devastating though written back in the book s takes on genetic engineering are surprisingly accurate seen in today s context this is an excellent pop sci fi thriller

strained relations this th chronicle of brother cadfael has less about him and more about history in fact he really only appears at the beginning and at the ending and doesn t have any hand at all in the solving of crimes the story springs from the tempestuous relationship between owain gwynedd prince of wales and cadwaladr his treacherous and headstrong younger brother the brothers have had no peace between them for years as cadwaladr is forever plotting to seize power for himself being beaten at this game by his brother and then counting on the strong family ties that exist in all welshmen to be forgiven and taken back into the fold this time he has gone too far however and has hired danish mercenaries to attack owain s troops these danes have been settled in ireland for generations a fact i did not know and were just as much irish as danish and were christian to boot ! it was an interesting read for the historical contents alone even if cadfael scarcely appeared

in a class by itself i come from a background that is mostly asian in terms of my exposure to inner cultivation when i first picked up the book which had been in my library for more than two years i thought it was a book from an asian tradition i was wrong sort of many inner traditions are the products of gender and culture what this book does is remove all of that and get to the heart of inner cultivation self realization realization that you are more than your flesh but yet your flesh is a part of your existence being that life is a balancing act for most people mr bardon stresses this which to me proves him to be a responsible person to have information from a source that is accurate and responsible is rare and to be commended the exercices are not all unique to this work but the presentation balance and formulation of what to do and how to do are uncanny many books are nothing but empty theory not based on the writers experience you can spot this becuase most books lack explanation of concrete results related to completing the stated phase of training some are so empty that no real concrete training is even mentioned mr bardon does not lack in this area one bit to sum it up this book is for extremely serious mature people who wish to develop the awareness and ability to interact with duality beyond normal sight and sound it is for those that are ready to get some answers by the sweat of their efforts all results that have the potential to lead to greatness will take time be patient and diligent if you decide to embark on this journey 
a middle east quotblack like me quot yoram binur an israeli journalist fluent in arabic from covering stories in the arab areas of his country decided to take on a fake identity as an arab to get first hand experience of the treatment arabs receive from the israeli police and society he was convincing enough to be singled out for harassment and violence from the police and he experienced subtle discrimination from everyday israelis he learned to really feel the terror arabs in israel feel every time an army vehicle approaches them or even passes by their house at night knowing they could legally be brutalized at any time for no reason it was an eye opening account from inside one of the most complex political situations on earth and binur always kept it personal and involving

another fine mess of a book laurel and hardy are the eternal image to many of down ontheirluck individuals struggling just to get by in this world and in his book stan and ollie author simon louvish explains why they appeal to us after almost a century has passed since their first film together in an exhuastive and well paced dual biography of the world s greatest comedy duo louvish provides insights into the two men who jointly comprised a team that was embraced the world over stan jefferson laurel and oliver hardy could not have come from more different backgrounds laurel s father was a north england theater manager who dabbled in play writing and his son became an actor on the stage just as vaudeville was on its way out and films on their way in hardy never knew his father a civil war veteran and local celebrity in their part of the state of georgia both men took long routes towards the inevitable pairing as louvish demonstrates in what can be felt as a teaser of near misses and almost rans between the two when they both arrive in hollywood in the mid teens but in they finally teamed up and started what would become the most celebrated partnership in film comedy throughout it all louvish gives us a portrait of the men behind the image that is all the more important to know hardy the jolly fat man was actually self conscious about his weight and struggled to keep it under control laurel the simple child like companion was something of a ladies man and the tales of his multpile marriages including a series of ill timed weddings to the same woman over the course of years make for an interesting glimpse into his troubled private life laurel and hardy together briefly during the last days of the silent era were able to transcend the barrier of sound and they may well have been meant for the new entertainment form louvish details how they not only survived in the wake of other silent performers buster keaton harold lloyd falling out of favor but indeed prosper and contribute some of their best material in the early thirties throughout the book louvish intersects accounts of the films they made together with some of the personal details that helped to shape their time together he also addresses the odd fact of their embrace by the gay community and hardy s troubled southern heritage and what it may have meant to the era of the thirties when openly racist portrayals of the black race ran rampant and unchecked stan laurel emerges as a particularly harried figure as his constant marital troubles become the fodder for hollywood gossip mavens a precursor of the current swath of celebrity marital trouble stories circulating in today s entertainment obsessed media in the entertaining way he critiques their work first the golden years at hal roach s studio then later the twentieth century fox and mgm films louvish comes off not as a grumbling critic but a genuine fan one who has sat through the dreck as well as the highlights he can be trusted to give the straight story on the flops as well as the classics sons of the desert the music box etc louvish s style is not the dry bare bones approach of more scholarly approaches to film but he has the right amount of reverence to make up for any percieved flippancy towards his subjects after all his profile is that of a comedy duo not an auteur like kubrick or godard louvish successfully argues what s more that the films of laurel and hardy while not meant to be artistic statements are worthy of close study and even analysis for their place in easing the country through the depression and the second world war a claim that he puts forth for the lesser fox pictures though acknowledging their flaws what s more the friendship between laurel and hardy is genunine unlike so many comedy partnerships that seem fraught with tension the book is probably the closest we will get to knowing the real laurel and hardy as well as understanding their most memorable films together it will definitely be the first thing i recommend for l h neophytes and for diehard fans as well put simply this is the book to read if you want to know about the greatest comedy duo of the film age

intelligent examination of the overlooked role of violence though this book does not have the same power over me as on revolution had on violence is still a very well written witty and insightful look at the power structures most prevalent in the early s arendt makes the intelligent claim that those with power that are losing that power will hit a point where they only see violence as a means to maintain the current power distribution but that violence will actually cause a loss of power the book can be read in a day and should but this book needs to be read or times to catch all of the subtle points arendt throws in unannounced the main criticism i have of this book is its failure at points to demonstrate the relavence of her arguments which i find she does incredibly well in her other books not a must buy but if you have the option take it

my favorite of the dresden files at a nadir from the events in grave peril summer knight takes harry from lowest point and brings his life back together we learn more about the youth and making of the most interesting wizard pi ever written this is my favorite dresden file and i write this as book number eight was recently released what makes this one so great we get to see harry work as a detective and are with him as he makes revelation after revelation across the bad hand of conflicting obligations he is dealt stuck with satifying a faerie queen the white council his friends himself and sort of saving the world harry dresden truly gets his act together and steps up to the challenge butcher wrote this believable with rich details to a break neck narrative pace i can t forget the touching emotional scenes or the humorous parts in short the multi layered plot and richness of character in this novel is rare in all fiction appreciate it summer knight also gets away from the vampires and more into the supernatural background behind the world of harry dresden which was a big plus for me lots of urban fantasy authors seem stuck at one supernatural aspect but butcher breaks that mold in conclusion if you like fantasy and don t have this book buy it ! you ll want to read it again i don t care if you haven t read the rest of the series buy it anyway the book is that good 
unexpected twist as you can imagine things didn t exactly turn out as he d expected heggstad s first day into columbia he s kidnapped by rebels and held captive for several weeks before being released if that sounds like an interesting read it really is the first part of the book appears to have been written from a collection of daily postings on his website and reveals nothing of what is to come as a result the writing through the first part of the book is rather clunky and a little hard to read with mixed tenses all over the place by the time he gets kidnapped the writing changes dramatically as i assume he s retelling the events at a much later date and as the book progresses the writing continues to get better and more eloquent heggstad is brutally honest even to the point where he opens himself up to criticism when telling of his trepidation and unease just before he gets captured he also tends to be a bit of a hot head and reacts in ways that may have made his situation worse overall the book is worth every effort to read i managed to read mine cover to cover in less than a week but by the end i was as ready to be back home as i imagine the author was few motorcycle books exist and even fewer of them are worth much attention

sartre s last major philosophical work seeking to give marxism what michael mcgee called a more rigorous intellectual defense sartre wrote volume one of critique of dialectical reason cdr between it was published in france in the first english edition appeared in a second unfinished volume appeared posthumously in cdr was a massive attempt to describe the dynamic of various levels of human interaction what characterizes these levels from a mere chance collection of people to the social entity we call an institution the ultimate objective was to show why marx s categorization of class as some kind of hyperorganism was wrong its thesis statement can be drawn from its thematic antecedent search for a method cultural order is irreducible to natural order in cdr life was endless occasions of totalizations detotalizations retotalizatons on a field of scarcity these various totalizations were instances of human groupness whether people waiting the bus stop a soccer team or the mob storming the bastille we called the temporalization of events history first half of the volume or book i is devoted mainly to ennui provoking explanation of the dialectical investigation hidden there in a footnote was sartre s curt dismissal of darwinism however he got wound up in book ii showed how task assignments division of labor the institution came about i know of no other original study treatise or even novel that uses the themes concepts of cdr a cdr oriented examination of say american domestic relations court proceedings with its forced as opposed to mediated reciprocity might be a worthy endeavor

superb this is the best book i have read on the history of globalization it is superb it is well written it is sweeping in its vision and the scholarship that undergirds the book is remarkable bayly has read widely in disparate fields like african chinese mughal and british history nationalism economic development the state military history and globalization bayly appeals to the professional historian interested in historiographical debates over nationalism colonialism economic development and many other matters he brings these debates into his narration in a judicious manner but historiography does not overwhelm the narrative this is a book that can be savored by the professional historian and educated layperson alike 
simply superb this book cuts straight to the point without any nonsense inbetween it is a valuable resource for any teacher or parent no matter what field hightly recommended

frank castle at his best what can i say about the punisher that hasn t been said in comic coventions not only across america but but throughtout the world from the time i picked up this book and started reading i was just caught up in the punisher s world it really gives insight not only as to his motives but just how much he values human life with the exception of mobsters hitmen etc when i heard that a punisher movie was in the making i remember being excited thinking how well the movie would be if they followed the welcome back frank storyline what the world witnessed however is how hollywood takes the best things in life and poison everything they touch the punisher movie is a very loose translation of this book so if you re a real punisher fan just curious about the character or seen the movie and collecting the book make sure and pick this one up it has to be one of the greatest graphic novels written in the new milleniu 
i really liked this book this was a really great book it really affects you and youaredrawn completely into it it made me sad because i felt everythingthat jp felt even though my life isn t anything like his i was a little disappointed in the ending maybe because it was the end of a really good book and maybe because it needed to be wrapped up more there still are some things i wondered about but the book gave me a lot to think about i m really glad i read this book and i recommend it

good reference for advanced not a logical intro to gr this book is known as the bible of general relativity or mtwpeople with different preparation will perceive mtw in different ways the beginners in gr very often will feel that the book is a good reference and shows properties of the defined objects instead of explaining the logical necessity of demanding such properties my first course in gr was based on that book and although i learned some index gymnastics from it very often i had questions of the type where does this come from why is it defined this way often i would read about something like affine parameter and i would not understand its importance at all for beginners i recommend the books from j hartle b schutz and s carroll in order of increasing abstraction i am currently in the middle of course based on the carroll s book and i understand things i have never ever been able to understand from the bible like the fact that we may define different connections but only one of them is metric compatible and we choose to work with it or that we choose to work with a torsion free connection or that reparametrizing a geodesic may not give you back a geodesic in relation to the affine parameter remark above such facts are either not clearly spelled in the bible or they are digged in somewhere pages away once you are past your first or better second course in gr that book will be an invaluable reference for you with plenty of examples how to apply different computational and theoretical techniques in gr the reviewers that give it high rating are obviously either experienced in the field or are begginners that value a book only because of the well known authours the book is really a titanic effort to compile all relevant pieces of info into one thick volume but please please think carefully before you recommend it for introduction to general relativity

well written this is my first julian barnes novel as well as a sherlock holmes fan the premise was interesting but somehow i found only the plight of george and his family to be the most interesting with doyle i think i was given almost too much information just enough to wonder if i really liked the author as a man i read the book in under two days on a trip and despite the misgivings i had when i started it it did turn out to be a worthwhile read an interesting look at the times and the foibles of the english legal system at that time 
simple communication techniques expertly explained in an entertaining package this book describes a few simple techniques for dealing with difficult questions from the audience after a formal business presentation or from journalists after a press conference in particular the author explains how to control the interaction with the questioners formulate answers that are less likely be perceived by the audience as contentious or evasive and how to forcefully get one s message across as part of the answer the techniques themselves could have been described in or pages nevertheless the author manages to put together a whole book firstly by analogizing them to the martial arts and then by providing detailed examples from the last years of presidential debates this works out very well indeed and the reader is left with a thorough understanding of the mechanics involved in handling these situations based on both concepts and debate examples described after finishing the book i really felt i was coming away with something tangible that could be utilized to my advantage in a variety of situations both professional and personal

i fell in love with silent pictures from this book when i first read the hardback version of this book back in the s in film school i fell in love with silent pictures kevin brownlow s writing enabled me to visualize films i had never seen and feel like i was there when american cinema was being birthed his descriptions of films like douglas fairbanks robin hood caused me to search for decades for copies of these films just so i could glimpse the breathtaking beauty he describes i wished i had been born during that era so i could have been a part of that parade unfortunately as happens with most things that are overly romanticized one day i really was able to see robin hood when it finally came out on dvd it had been fully restored and was a perfect representation of the original i was gravely disappointed by what i saw when i read brownlow s descriptions of tinting i had visualized the kind of tinting that is done in still photography which looks delicate and subtle i thought of broken blossoms in those tones and could only imagine how beautiful it was unfortunately in the silent era what they called tinting is what we today would call adding a color filter when they wanted a night scene they cast it in blue when it was dawn they made it yellow when it was sunset they made it orange etc i m not talking about a subtle hint of color i m talking about one strong color that covered the whole screen i was shocked by this technique because i thought it destroyed the photography his description of the music of the era was that it was something wonderful the music in robin hood is repetitive and never ending i found myself longing for a break from it but it never occurred he describes fairbank s acting as superb i found it overly theatrical and almost carnivalesque he was certainly athletic but he carries it to the extreme of almost seeming like a circus performer rather than an actor other aspects were equally disappointing i know that the silent era laid the foundation upon which our entire modern movie industry art and science alike was built i fully appreciate the contributions of all the talented people who came before but it was after all only a beginning and not the parade certainly not the golden era that those who lived then would have us believe i think that sunset boulevard adequately depicts the delusions with which many of the tarnished stars of that era lived i appreciate mr brownlow s writing which is very entertaining and interesting there is no question that the photographs in his book are authentic and wonderful almost better than the films they depict there is not even a question that the era he describes was anything but astounding but he does present it in a very romanticized light and it does cause one to long for something that probably never existed at least not in that idyllic form nevertheless i still believe this book to be the most definitive work on the silent era in motion pictures waitsel smit

lady windermere i have always enjoyed all of oscar wilde s works but this is not very good compared with the others but none the less still worth reading the characters were sort of dull but the plot intresting which made up for it i d reccomend this to fans of oscar wilde but if you have just discovered wilde skip this and start with either the picture of dorian gray or the importance of being earnest

mixed bag of beauty flowers myth and pretentious problems flaws no this isn t a perfect book series it can be weighed down by pretentious storylines and attempts to address serious issues ex weetzie s attempts to get a child cause major rifts worthy for a while of oprah dirk and duck one of the series most prominent couples become a spring board for heavy subjects of bigotry and aids melodrama will sometimes take the place of real emotion weetzie the main character through out the first book at least is mostly defined as an original person because of her part in a punk culture that will eventually become to mainstream observations made in the series are often superficial but despite these flaws dangerous angels can be absolutely charming when i first read this series as a young teenager i d rarely encountered such beautifully written prose allusions are made to the grit and glamour of l a in a single sentence gentle fairy tales are blended seamlessly with the story s chaotic reality the observations of people and things might be too cutesy but they re colored with more depth than the usual bestselling novel true the issues mentioned in the books are often too large to be addressed with such quirk but block allows enough ambiguity for each subject to prompt the reader to think a little humanity bleeds through every character no matter how silly they act or the mistakes they make maybe even the superficial layers of the books deserve more consideration it mostly takes place in california after all how much more superficial can you get the flaws of the books are outshone by their virtues however to the wary reader as disarmingly beautiful as block s fictional world is i suggest not only reading her works but also those of other more classic and skilled writers the weetzie bat series is gorgeous but eventually its reality is too narrow remember to love and treasure these stories i do but like the love described in dangerous angels they re not the only fish in the sea 
and alexander said i share your fate i had the pleasure taking dr kurke s leadership class while working on my mba and of seeing him give two uplifting presentations on alexander the great i am so glad that he published his book giving all of us more access to his insight into this majestic leader thank you dr kurke ! i highly recommend this book 
a great book about a great civilization during the middle ages henry adams mont saint michel and chartres msmc is simply a great book adams lucid writing style and his insights are impressive and this book should be read by every supposedly educated individual adams deals with complex topics such as gothic architecture medieval poetry and mysticsim and scholastic philosophy with clarity and ease the early sections of msmc compare the church of mont saint michel with the catholic view of st michel who was militant and was the perfect example of the medieval hero defending the catholic church against all enemies the comparison with this church with that of chartres which was the examplar of god s mercy via st mary is insighful and facinating reading such embellishment of st mary or notre dame our lady is further investigated in adams book by adams careful treatment of medieval poetry adams s translations of medieval french and latin are good and give those who are not familiar with these languages a better understanding of both the poetry and the medieval devotion to st mary much of this peotry was mystical and adams demonstrates the attempt of st francis and the franciscans to use such mystical thought in their missionary efforts to help the very poor st francis mysticism is revealed in adams translation of st francis poem titled brother sun and sister moon henry adams then compares and contrasts medieveal mysticism which bordered on pantheism with scholastic philosophy adams gives the reader an insight to scholastic debate when he summarizes the debate between william of champaux and peter abelard here adams demonstrates his understanding of how students and masters argued and learned he also shows the careful balence the catholic authorities tried to impose between reasoned debate and heresy the last section of the book deals with the angelic doctor st thomas aquinas adams careful treatment of aquinas thought is worth the price of the book adams gives the angelic doctor high praise for both his clear thinking and liberality adams also effectively deals with the liberality of the medieval catholic authorities who canonized so many men whose views were apparently contradcitory henry adams mont saint michel and chartres is intellectual history at its best the book deals with complex ideas and views in an attractive literary style which holds the readers interest this reviewer has read this book numerous times since he first read it in and has never found the book to be boring readers should also read thomas woods how the catholic church built western civilization and compare woods sections on the high middle ages with adams book 
clinton era wake up call my only beef about this book is that i waited too long to purchase it it was written during the campaign and meant as a tocsin for those times who knows what a more powerful book the author could have produced after increased government spending by a republican president ! and more of the same political correctness he writes about although i have not yet read it i suspect he does so so in his second book showdown published in he certainly spares neither democrats or republicans in the ten things you can t say in america one of the things you can t say is that there isn t a dime s worth of difference between the two parties a suspicion i ve had ever since james carville got engaged to mary matalin but ten things does suffer a tad from a lack of aging well and a betting person might do well to invest in showdown instead as to elder s philosophies i find them well reasoned and discussed while the first of the book reads as an indictment to the minorityfocused liberal who might be shocked to see the sacred cows of affirmative action multiculturalism welfare and others skewered by mr elder s logic the self congratulating conservative might find themselves skewered themselves by the equally well argued final third which discusses abortion mr elder advocates access to it legalization of drugs hes for it and the tendency of conservative politicians to want to legislate morality he is against that and muses at how that goes against the stated conservative goal to keep government out of our lives i learned of ten things from a conservative publication and expected it to simply trumpet my own values instead although i did learn better arguments for some of the things i believe i did find myself challenged in areas often thought of as liberal territory for these reasons i do recommend you listen to what elder has to say but be aware this book uses older sometimes resolved arguments to help him do it 
the morality of liberalism john rawls is indisputably the most honorable spokesman of political liberalism of the past twenty five years his theoretical committment to and devlopment of liberalism is an inspiring attempt to reconcile the difficulties inherent in a heterogenous society in which different conceptions of the good life and varied value systems beliefs and principles can coexist and yet affirm the political conception of a constitutional regime how can a nation entreat its inhabitants to carve out their conception of the good life and their own value systems and yet achieve agreement on a set of principles that all citizens may abide by it is the answer to this question that rawls s works have sought to answer the law of peoples is no less concerned with this question rawls s attempts to extend a social contractarian approach to human existence on the international level is thorough and nuanced liberal peoples he argues have three basic features they possess a reasonably just constitutional democractic government that serves their fundamental interests they are united by common sympathies and above all they have a morally mature nature critics who claim that rawls s brand of liberalism invites a form of moral agnosticism had better think twice moral maturity and its genetic antecedent human moral nature are the preconditions that underly the moral basis of liberalism in general deep respect for human beings and the necessity of treating them as ends in themselves rawls s development of a just war doctrine should force us to re think traditional concepts of sovereignty and undermines the claims to legitimacy that outlaw states seek to impose on moral communities in the name of cultural authenticity in this respect rawls work is indispensible to young liberal scholar s such as myself in fact i have depended on his theoretical approach to ground much of my highly controversial and hotly contested book quotbecoming a cosmopolitan what it means to be a human being in the new millennium quot i argue however for a more pugnacious form of liberalism by rejecting outright as conceptions of the good all forms of tribal racialethnic and national identities and argue for the obliteration of all cultural practices that undermine human rights for those who believe that moral progress is possible and who wish to further advance the idea that liberal democracies represent a superior and more evolved form of social and political living the law of peoples is a detailed and rigorous application of this idea 
masterpiece of illustrated history this book is overflowing with beautiful maps fascinating photos and insightful descriptions i find nicolle s historical atlas of the islamic world to be one of the best introductions to the history of the muslim world the layout is astounding and puts much pricier atlases even the oxford atlas of world history to shame one should note that this is not just a history of the muslim religion but a broad description of the history and culture of muslim countries covering spain africa central asia southeast asia and of course the middle east mr nicolle s approach to islam combines sympathy and neutrality he is obviously one of the most eminent authorities on the muslim world

awesome this book is an awesome read and i hope that i can convey how profitable and riveting a read the book is it is the story of god moving on behalf of one of his children the author she is a christian who suffered with acute and excruciating pain for seven years from a neurological disorder the pain was debilitating somehow with great courage she resolved to get a hold of god and not turn him loose until she received her healing it is an amazing and compelling journey that reaches its apex with her healing a demonstration of god s great mercy it s a story of faith and support from a loving family even in the darkest and cruelest of hours if you have a physical or emotional problem or perhaps both this is a must read book for you if you are interested in how faith interacts and intersects with god s designs then i encourage you to read it at once this isn t abstract or esoteric writing it is the language of where the rubber meets the pavement the book has a prophetic and didactic voice and i can t recommend it enough i sincerely commend it and anticipate that god will use it to strengthen and bless the reader with his great mercy 
carlip s dimensional quantum gravity this is the outstanding reference and survey book for quantum gravity in spatial and time dimensions and also has a number of carlip s own recent contributions when quantum gravity qg for short is restricted to spatial dimensions it simplifies analysis enormously both physically and mathematically i have cited carlip s book both in papers delivered at conferences and in publications here is the opportunity to understand different schools of quantum gravity including the hawking hartle school and its comparison with the closely related lortentian metric vs euclidean metric school the ashtekar smolin loop school the wheeler dewitt equation school the lattice school the feymann path integral school the black hole entropy schools to which both carlip and hawking penrose have contributed various algebraic and topological schools the incredibly rich moduli space and modular transformation results and so on unlike most books carlip s is open minded regarding different schools and gives comparisons and criticisms which are invaluable the non expert in quantum gravity would be well advised to start learning from this book and a few very clear mathematics and physics books or to hire a consultant or even a tutor to explain prerequisites and some of the mathematical concepts in the book because the average quantum gravity book is almost totally incomprehensible for non experts compared with carlip i consider carlip s clarity and comparisons between different schools to be far superior to even hawking s although of course hawking is almost unrivaled as a physicist the nearest you will come to carlip s presentation is by reading hundreds of journal articles and books which is impractical for most people 
easy fun read i found this book to be an easy fun book to read the main character wanted to change her life was not quite sure how to accomplish that but set out in unchartered waters to accomplish her goal highly recommend this book 
a close look at the dark side of humanity theodore dalrympe has spent much of his working life as a prison doctor seeing the very worst of human nature and this collection of essays discusses various aspects of british society and society in other countries the conclusions that he reaches are mostly depressing he sees british people as hoplelessly debased and vicious coarsened by the permissive society ignorant and un educated with neither manners nor morals some of the essays in this collection are quite fascinating there are two enthralling essays on shakespeare which clearly show his relevence to the times we live in and a savage critique of virginia woolf the distopian imagination which discusses brave new world and is fascinating and contains one of the most touching passages in the book visiting north korea dr dalrymple is surreptitiously approached by a young korean an electric moment for in north korea unsupervised contact between a korean and a foreigner is utterly unthinkable as unthinkable as shouting down with big brother ! do you speak english he asked me yes i replied i am a student at the foreign languages institute reading dickens and shakespeare is the greatest the only pleasure of my life it was the most searing communication i have ever received in my life for him dickens and shakespeare which the regime permitted him to read with quite other ends in view guaranteed the possibility not just of freedom but of truly human life itself inevitably there is an essay on the death of princess diana the public hysteria following her death is invariably pointed out as a sign of the deterioration of the british character however the mourning at the death of diana pales into complete insignificance when compared to the outbreak of public grief and hysteria on the death of princess charlotte daughter of the prince regent later king george iv in compared to the lavish displays of public grief and mourning on that occasion the mourning for diana is quite a minor incident mourning over the death of popular public characters is not a twentieth century invention one of the most ineresting essays in the book deals with the legalisation of drugs something dr dalrymple is implacably opposed to previously agnositc on the subject i have to say that his arguments convinced me entirely that drugs should remain illegal that people will continue to take drugs even when they are illegal is not an argument for legalising them any more than it is as he points out a reason for legalising any other kind of criminal behaviour if the war against drugs is lost then so are the wars against theft speeding incest fraud rape murder arson and illegal parking few if any such wars are winnable so let us all do anything we choose the uses of corruption contrast italian society with british and comes out firmly favourable on the side of the italians the reason why italian society is flourishing while british society is collapsing is dr dalrymple concludes because of the corrupt nature of italian beuraucracy because the italians know that their beuaracracy is corrupt they do not rely on it to help them and so remain self sufficient and enterprsing whereas the british beleiveing their beauracracy to be benign depend on it passively for everything all of the essays in this collection are interesting and most of them gave me a different perspective on whatever subject they discussed however i have no first hand experience of the worst of human nature having lived all my life in mostly pleasant suburban areas rather than amid the bleak squalor of the inner cities i have not seen as dr dalrymple has the very worst that human beings are capable of most of the people i know including the much demonised single mothers are decent people leading decent lives and trying to raise their children to be decent people too i retain a hope that society is not quite as squalid and irredeemably vile as dr dalrymple believes the best line in the book is in the essay howand how not to love manking which is this the victory over cruelty is never final but like the maintenance of freedom requires eternal vigilance reading this book induces depression but also sharpens your vigilance

a pleasant airport or beach book james robert parish s fiasco is an interesting read for anyone with a penchant for hollywood film history but in it s review of some of the worst pictures ever made he seems to be repeating himself pictures fail only when they don t bring in the requisite amount of dollars everything else is secondary to whether or not the film makes money and not just a relatively small profit the movies have to make many many times their cost to not be a failure that can be a pretty high hurdle ultimately the causes are all the same lack of studio or producer oversight inflated star egos unplanned for and costly over time bad press and reviews some of hollywood s truly awful films are not reviewed here heavens gate being the primary example and some that were arguably fair movies just not big money makers are for example cleopatra is the opening chapter and sets the stage for all that follows you ll get no argument from me that cleopatra was a trial to make however in my humble opinion the final result is a lush tale that fails only in the last third of the picture given that i had to laugh at one contemporary reviewer s comment that elizabeth taylor screeches like a ward heeler s wife at a block party in the last half of the film so true mr parish also refers to a number of vanity films that are made to promote the liberal political views of the actors involved the chase the wild party and reds for example but never explores the possibility that audiences go to movies to be entertained not lectured to i know it s currently popular to criticize entertainers for using their platforms to promote their personal political views and i m not trying to join that band wagon but it s fair to suggest that a movie made primarily to criticize traditional american mores is not going to be a big hit with the vast majority of traditional americans each chapter begins with a brief overview of the state of theater going i e attendance numbers ticket price etc and this is interesting in itself it also contains some few surprises for example who knew that the song dance numbers in ishtar were intentionally bad i just thought that was a natural by product of the fact that beatty and hoffman while talented actors are neither singers nor dancers allinall mr parish s book is an entertaining read and fair accounting of some of the worst films ever made though he offers little hope that studios talent or corporate owners have learned anything in the way of lessons from their checkered past the book is certainly a breath of fresh air from the traditional tinsel town history that trumpets silver screen successes and bypasses its flops 
good atlas could be better i agree with the other review in that the actual real pictures were extremely helpful yet the depiction of tracts were difficult for me to follow at times this is a required text for my neuroanatomy course and it served a vital purpose i like this text and would recommend it to anyone in the field 
thought provoking a germ s point of view arno karlen s attempt to chronicle the successes and failures of man s quest to survive in a world in which he is constantly battling with disease results in an engaging and fairly easy to read book the author explains how man and microbes share the environments they have lived in throughout history on all parts of this planet this symbiotic coexistence has resulted in mutation adaptation and even the destruction of sometimes man sometimes microbe and even sometimes both ! the author succeeds in engaging the attention of the reader and keeping his or her interest from page to page the author s method of presenting the challenges faced by many people in this world throughout history and leading us up to the modern era succeeds in engaging the reader from the very first chapter the opening account of the incipient yet monumental role that disease has played throughout the history of mankind rivets the reader s attention he presents an account of the struggle for existence by not only the human race but also by the millions of tiny organisms whose existence naturally pits them against that of the existence of man additionally mr karlen does a fairly decent job of explaining to the reader why certain microbes survived in what would appear to be harsh environments while others succumbed to the elements in relatively mild ones he then leads the reader through the modern onslaught of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis malaria and hiv aids and chronicles how man has fared in his fight against disease this helps the reader to understand the historical context of these events and how these tiny organisms essentially shaped the outcomes of many significant events in world history the author presents his main argument first by effectively painting a frightening picture of today s reality of man s fight with microbes followed by a detailed chronology of the historical battles between organism the environment and man the author then skillfully concludes with an implicit warning to us which leaves a lasting effect of wondering when and where the next onslaught of infectious disease will appear the fact that the overall health of the world s population has improved over the past several centuries is cause for guarded optimism however the author presents many examples throughout history where mother nature sensing an imbalance between her natural resources and the inhabitants of this planet has leveled the playing field by introducing an infectious disease that has resulted in a massive die off of humans the great plague cholera pandemics etc the author utilizes his expertise in pharmacology and biology to explain to the reader how researchers have been able to determine how people in the past lived and died using such techniques as carbon dating and examining the human remains of mummified individuals we have been able to determine that man s earliest ancestors had a life span of about forty and suffered a harsh life riddled with hunting accidents and disease we have also learned how the lifestyle diet and environment served as determinants of whether man would survive in a certain region or not much has been learned from the refuse piles and discarded wastes that our ancestors left behind ! the old adage which comes to mind is one man s garbage is another s treasure mr karlen explains this quite well and gives the reader avid examples man and microbes is not only a must read for all health professionals and those aspiring to become one but it is also for everyone who has the slightest bit of interest in the interaction between man and his environment the insights and perspectives that the author elicits in the reader cause one to truly catch what he terms the medical school student disease a subtle realization of how vulnerable we really are in our environment ! this is a fundamental book which serves to educate not only the health professional but the general public as well he does an excellent job in describing to the reader how vulnerable we currently are to the spread of influenza or other infectious disease which we would be wholly susceptible to his use of historical events to forewarn us of the dangers we as a population currently face is quite effective a potential weakness of this book lies in the author s use of technical terms and medical jargon although this reader understood his presentation in the field of medicine infectious disease study it is very difficult to avoid highly technical terms and concepts his description of some of the disease pathologies in humans and animals and how they have evolved and adapted to their changing environments was at times entirely too difficult to comprehend unless one already possesses a rudimentary knowledge of human anatomy and disease pathology a reader may have to re read certain sections for clarity and even visit a medical dictionary to gain a better appreciation for what the author is try to communicate this book s main strength comes from its detail rich accounting of those historical events in world epidemiological history such as the black death of the early th century the numerous cholera pandemics that have swept across the world and the hiv aids pandemic which is currently wreaking havoc in places such as sub saharan africa asia and latin america mr karlen appears to be an absolute subject matter expert in the field and one who has walked the walk and not just talked the talk he does an absolutely superb job in capturing the reader s attention and instilling in him the knowledge acquired through years of experience i highly recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in the area of infectious disease our environment and challenges facing mankind in the future 
to be continued i haven t read a novel by v c andrews since the series that began with flowers in the attic but that was a long time ago and i should have expected something different i was still somewhat disappointed that this one wasn t in the same genre and more in young adult territory but it was entertaining all the same this is the story of three teenagers from different walks of life but each firmly on the path to self destructionrobin is from a broken home doesn t know who her father is neither does her mother and has been forced to move to nashville with her mother who is pursuing a singing career she constantly gets herself into trouble until she meets a boy with even worse problems when everything finally falls apart teal has everything a girl could dream of except the love of her parents she was born after her parents had passed the point of wanting children and never felt like a part of the family to get the attention she craves she keeps pulling wilder and more dangerous stunts and when she meets a boy from the wrong side of the tracks she stretches way too far on her already insecure limb phoebe was born into problems with an irresponsible mother and a weak natured father and when her mother takes off for parts unknown her father leaves her in the care of her aunt and uncle who are strict disciplinarians unable to stay out of trouble she meets a wealthy young man who has selfish motives of his own this is where the story leaves us high and dry and you need to get the sequel midnight flight to see what happens to the three in the end the story of the troubled teenagers is a to be continued amanda richards january 
lacuna i did not read all of the above reviews but i agreed with most of what i did read and found the book to be cogent and satisfying in its arguments if incomplete pretty dreadful story he tells difficult to apportion blame or to fashion a realistic solution the only consolation i found after walking around for a few days in a comatose like state trying to digest all these frigthening observations was that these doomngloomers are usually wrong but like the boy who cried wolf maybe this time there really is something to worry about hard to know criticism prestowitz might have spent a bit more time on the corollary topic of immigration and labor on p for example he suggests employment in a nonoutsourceable type of trade plumber nurse electrician this is an perfectly offhand shallow and unrealistic appraisal of the changes in the us labor market for the same reasons that chinese manufacturing or indian services are good for consumers so too are the pitifully low labor rates for immigrant labor and each new wave underbids the last now technically this is not outsourcing but the result is exactly the same as manufacturing and service jobs vanish overseas the cost of unskilled and skilled labor at home is being driven straight into the ground the middle class and the lower middle class are being crushed as a good american i would never wish to be associated with those who would deny an immigrant the opportunity for self betterment nor in my wildest dreams would i have imagined myself on the side of protectionism i wish that prestowitz had spent a bit more time on this topic as it is an issue which is obviously better suited for greater minds than mine by the way in case you missed my point these are jobs that will remain safe p don t believe it 
classic liberalism at its best an all time favorite of mine capitalism freedom creates a framework of classic liberalism and argues forcefully in favor of free markets and decentralization over the expansion of government involvement in economic and social affairs friedman builds his argument from the ground up by identifying coercion as the state s distinguishing feature over all other societal organizations from the classic liberal s perspective this aspect shapes the relationship between citizen and government and strictly limits the appropriateness of state involvement in society particularly with regard to well intentioned programs and policy friedman uses this foundation to build a case for limited government in economic matters citing in particular the consequences of monetary and fiscal policy abuse in an exceptionally apt comparison friedman argues that the same rationale that limits government interference with free speech should likewise apply to government interference in the economy namely that constraints be applied to monetary and fiscal policy to limit the potential for government to do harm in its pursuit of doing good friedman gives numerous examples in which government officials exercising carte blanche economic authority have further aggravated economic crises by applying a case bycase standardh to different economic scenarios having clearly laid out his political philosophy friedman builds his case for free markets detailing control measures intrinsic of a laissez faire economy from floating exchange rates to voucher funded schooling union contracts to charity friedman argues that the free market harnesses the productive potential of millions of individuals and corporations reconciling their preferences in a competitive process far more efficiently than any collective body throughout the book friedman debunks popular myths disputes misunderstandings and challenges the conventional wisdom prevalent among intellectuals and social elites of his day and ours the book s only drawback is its age and somewhat antiquated writing style that would certainly make it difficult for some readers to fully understand particularly those who are victims of public school education friedman references several examples that would have been more easily recognized in the s but will not be immediately familiar to younger readers still this brilliant work presents the core principles of laissez faire capitalism and classic liberalism in a relatively clear manner and is a must read for anyone studying the dynamics of free markets and free societies 
extremly well written excellent info about managing people i liked the style of the book it s extremly well written very easy to read i couldn t put it down jack writes in a very direct way no fluff just stuff he provides very useful experiences about managing people the whole book is written from a practical and pragmatic view you will not find any graphs or formulas here for example though a thick book could be written about six sigma and it s mathematical bases no jack admits he never studied in depth the statistical part morover he explains the basics of it on one a so you get it instanly and you can decide whether ss is appropriate for you or not i think the best value of this book is how to handle people there are dozens of valuable examples it goes into details how does the private life of employer impact the organization while he remains interesting jack has a great self reflection he admits he made mistakes even exposes parts of his private life after reading comments at amazon about this book i can say the reviewers fall into two groups those who hate the book and those who love it those who wrote critical comments about book always adressed j welch not the book itself i think no matter you hate jack or love the contents of this book will undoubtly help you 
solid little thing about drugs and their devistation my mother has introduced numerous authors to me and i am glad that she has she has introduced to me to classics to modern day litature and some crud books i learned what to pick from her i know what to read when she introduced this book to me i had no prior knowledge about the author james frey for all i knew it was a drug book after my mother had finished it she gave it to me to read i was skeptical about it i felt that i could not read it because it didn t sound intresting it was a story of a man that defines rock bottom he wakes up on a plane covered in body fluids and has a hole in his cheek which he has no recollection of getting it he is then taken to a rehababilitation facility where he detoxs and thinks about life he then meets love and finds himself there it is a uplifting story prior to finishing or during the course of my reading it i found that there were accusations of lying in the story i was flabbergasted by it i didn t understand why he would make up stuff in the book but i got over it and understood that it was a solid story and had solid writing i felt that the people that blasted it for being fabricated probably read some or none at all of the story they were probably understandbly upset at his success with the book i am not blasting them but they need to open their eyes and read what is in front of them freys writing stylye is highly unorodox for a writer he doesn t write in paragraphs or is highly detailed he just is honest and to the point he doesn t hold back when he writes some people might find the story annoying but i find it original and it helps showcase the conversations which usually are in but not the case in this book it kind of reminds me of ee cummings and his poetry but frey doesn t do the random placement of punctuation he does get his point his mood and his feelings across though the conteversy of the book has severly damaged frey s reputation as a author he probably is spit on by the other authors for the fabrications this society is totally obessed with bringing out one key aspect of a person or thing and blowing the whole thing out of poportion frey is a solid author that deserves another chance he possibly has helped millons of people with his book get through whatever they were struggling through it is a inspiring book that is if you take off the goggles thrown on by the conteversy and read the book

useful but less dense than the previous volumes i quite liked bm if you ve not read the previous volumes i would highly recommend them especially volumes i and ii of the black medicine series are a great help for any serious martial arts or self defense student as for volume it is less densely packed than the previous volumes while the amount of information you are getting for the price of the book is relatively less it s still certainly worth the price on the other hand as the author explains in the introduction quotthe information in this book is much more quickly put to use quot this is true where the previous volumes required more self study this one is basically a quothowtoquot manual to mashiro s tricks of the trade 
a million little pieces i read this book on a cruise ship with its own casino naturally i was hooked and knocked it out in a couple of days i ve never read a mezrich epic before either fiction or non and didn t really spend much time trying to break the story down until well after i was finished a lot of the goings on seem too good to be true the bulk of the book recounts semyon dukach s adventures on the mit blackjack teams of the s although semyon is said to be about at the time and about at the time of writing approximately he remembers watching the ali liston title fight of february which is either an impossibility or a tip that dukach isn t precisely who the author thinks he is other happenings seem deliberately stilted many of the details about weather and wardrobe recalled by dukach for the author a decade after the fact simply have to be embellished mezrich tells us up front that names and identities were changed and it would probably destroy the story s spell to tell us how much was either made up or improved over the reality on the other hand you can generally accept that this is not fiction without casting aspersions about james frey upon the author the core of the book is a mathematical system for maximizing blackjack winnings and being able to predict what cards are coming out of the shoe if the dealer uses certain shuffling techniques alas the casino on my cruise ship did not use them mezrich himself visits mit for one of the book s investigative chapters and shows us that cracking blackjack science is par for the course for the school that invented radar and hacking knowledge and application of these techniques allows dukach and his presumably fictionalized cohorts to win a lot of money which they improbably store in cash in laundry baskets office desks and abandoned buildings where the irs fits into all this is never disclosed other facts such as the plane crash dukach survived and the investigative techniques of the various casinos described don t seem to have been researched by the author although he does hire an escort girl for an interview and closes that chapter with a wink and a nod to the reader the bottom line of course is that mezrich writes breezily and tantalizingly the chapters and casinos fly by with chases and escapes and eventually some love scenes i d love to believe that this story is mostly true what s indisputable is that dukach is if nothing else a master salesman and a great story spinner 
good reference for getting started with oop in php i ll get this out of the way up front i approached this book with a completely inaccurate perception of what it was going to give me i would consider myself an intermediate to advanced php developer and i was hoping this book would teach me awesome ways to use php s oop power to make my applications better faster and more attractive to women that wasn t what this book does this book introduces oop explains why it s useful and goes through to develop several sample applications to demonstrate oops power and more importantly how to use it the books pretty thin weighing in at pages split up amongst chapters the first bit of the book concentrates on explaining what oop is why php needs it and why you want it it then moves on to explain why oop sucked in php what works better in php and all the fancy new words you re going to need to memorize to use it protected private etc it then moves on to develop a sample indexing application adding in thumbnail generation as the book progresses later on more advanced topics like design patterns interfaces and exceptions are introduced finally the book gives a brief introduction to spl which was introduced in php and improved in php overall i would recommend this book to beginner php developers or intermediate developers who have not yet gotten their feet wet with oo

best year ever i wish i had more free time to read non work and school related material which is why it took me about months to finish reading team of rivals i found myself picking up the book and reading pages here and there until i fianlly had time to finish this excellent piece of historical research this book is a fascinating account of the lincoln presidency and the state of america during the years leading up to and through the civil war i highly reccomend this book to anyone who is a casual student of history and those who consider themselves wonks in this field my only advice is that you be willing to devote the time to this book because it is quite large but well worth it 
sensing our feelings feeling our senses ever heard a song or smelt a perfume that took you suddenly and unexpectedly back to another time and place what is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures but how they span time our senses connect us intimately with the past connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could ive just finished reading a natural history of the senses a book published in by diane ackerman a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one when i began i thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer chet raymo s the soul of the night ackerman s book like raymo s kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page it is a book in which i sense two underlying assumptions the first following thoreau s walden that we all living matter are very much a product of our environment and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain secondly that we are now so mechanised mere technoslaves that we run the risk of losing that vital connection once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth the experience of using our body in its normal healthy state is in itself pleasurable it is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure not a shutting out of unpleasant facts by our various addictions life is naturally a joyous state so let s learn about our senses but not in any conventional sense of learning for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses to get us in touch with our feelings sorry about the pun but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses the book is divided into five sections one for each sense with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals there are some good thoughts on how unique each species view of the world is how particular to our own species is our reality it is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider for instance or a cat one is a little more readier to accept another human s differing viewpoint for one thing my edition was a well produced one chapman with handcut pages marbled endpapers well matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture it felt looked and smelt enticing i love the smell of books the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch taste smell hearing vision the brain we usually think of the grey matter is part of a system the nervous system which occupies our entire body and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our big brain it parallels what psychologists following jung call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun it is a graceful and beautiful action for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy and other life forms have much to teach us we now study body language unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to but we respond to others body language with our own and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level our much neglected sense of smell for instance tells us how others are feeling gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate ackermans book is not a book on science but a book that demonstrates what science is for it is a book that i want to read again soon much of the book s fascination comes from ackerman s writing itself the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes evolution the behavior of monarch butterflies cleopatra and egyptian perfumes the colour range of insects the deer who come to her garden the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples ackerman has done something i admire very much synthesised culture science history and poetry to express a perception of human beings and their worlds for those who ve read this far i ve included my own musings to show just what kind of a book this is if you read it be prepared to have insights too also recommended is isabel allende s aphrodite and those food films like water for chocolate and eat drink man woman 
great book this book is an excellent book it is a series of little stories about the founding fathers most of the stories occur during the constitutional convention the author definitely did his research he found things that are not found in other books for example the author writes about how the quakers and ben franklin tried to introduce a resolution in the first congress to outlaw slavery the author also highlights the divisions that did exist in this country and were not really solved until the civil war if you want to view the founding fathers in a new light like real people you should read this book 
good book newton arvin provides an involving overview of herman melville s personal life and literary career in this biography which won the national book award in in contrast to many current biographies arvin clearly wrote this book and did not simply edit his lectures this counts with me since many biographies nowadays have the pace and style of lectures not the elegance and precision of great written prose the result in this case is that herman melville is its own literary experience not simply informed dictation transferred to the page certainly herman melville wrote what arvin calls one very great book and arvin does a wonderful job describing what he believes is great about moby dick in his excellent chapter the whale but he does an even better job addressing this question why didn t melville write more great books after hitting his stride in moby dick the short answers to this question are burnout and melville s failure after moby dick to find a form to match his gifts as arvin explains melville chose after his great book to write in a form that was as inexpressive to him as a foreign tongue in a sense this makes melville s decline a lesson to all writers as they grope for the form and structure that celebrates their content although published in herman melville holds up very well by current mores this biography probably underplays melville s sexual issues and overplays its occasional freudian insights but the book is not dated 
high toned son of a writer i m not a king reader but i do know of his former pseudonym richard bachman and it s partly this knowledge that makes the dark half go down so deliciously this book is of course the result of king s now exposed alter ego in his non fictional on writing king imagines bachman to be a rather unpleasant man with his own history and back story a fiction suit if you will the plot of tdh is similar thad beaumont is a writer whose pseudonym george stark takes on a life of his own after beaumont decides to expose his actual identity stark then goes on a killing spree in an attempt to reach thad and maintain his existence in the real world and like bachman stark is not a nice man this last element is the triumph of tdh stark is nasty ruthless clever and great with kids and wonderfully so the things he does are intolerable obviously but he is written with a dark wit and even some sympathy that makes him more than a razor wielding serial killer we know what kind of car he drives what his bumper sticker reads what kind of pencils he likes to write with we even get to spend some time inside his head king also adds excerpts from the books that stark writes or the books that thad pretending to be stark writes before he came alive and started killing people he s not faceless but as a murderer he remains tantalizingly just out of our reach and his search for creative autonomy from his creator is an intriguing sub plot that many artists will be able to empathize with his relationship with the meeker thad is carried out excellently though sometimes i found myself wishing king would stop being so subtle and just let stark and thad duke it out in their own private hell the supernatural elements are both beneficial and detrimental to the plot if as the cop character suggests stark was merely some psycho who was upset that beaumont stopped writing stark novels this would have been a much less relevant read the fact that stark is in fact a product of thad s overworked imagination and is even part of his personality puts tdh in a good position to explore the nature of the subconscious alter egos and what happens when fantasy is taken too far however there are some parts that slow the story down there is simply too much justification and exposition given to stark s existence the enigma of the sparrows is fascinating while unsolved but the book would have been cleaner without the mythos and psychic connections and much of the build up ends up leading to disappointing deus ex machina devices king takes things too far and too messily when i would have been content to just suspend my disbelief and take it as granted that stark could pull himself out of thad s internal netherworld another thing that bugged me was the cop character alan the pov switches around letting us catch glimpses of the plot from the eyes of different characters this got cumbersome after i had to continually wait for alan to catch on to what i and everyone else already knew the pacing started to drag near the end and worst of all stark s pov is left unattended for the last third or so this was not only inconsistent but reduced the character to just slightly above the level of your everyday supernatural maniac this is rectified just in time but though the ending is great fun to read it simply didn t fit in with whatever messages king had been leading up to with stark and his not entirely unsympathetic goals it seemed like a triumph of style over substance if you catch my drift despite the minor cop outs the pov meanderings the clumsy supernatural explanations and the drag just before the climactic finale the dark half is a juicy tale with some excellent characters fans of the explorations first undertaken in misery might appreciate this supernatural dark half 
one of mcmillan s best marilyn grimes a yearold housewife with three grown children is bored with her life although her husband leon is successful and has given her everything she could want materially she no longer feels any passion in their marriage and dreams about returning to her first husband marilyn s also sick of dealing with her crazy widowed mother inlaw arthurine who acts like marilyn s her own personal chauffeur and servant to her it seems like everyone s got something better something new to strive for all except marilyn on the opposite end of the spectrum there s marilyn s younger foster sister joy who s screwed up her life so badly that everyone seems to look out for her and she never has to worry about being free to do whatever she wants it takes a couple of earth shattering life events for marilyn to realize that life is what you make it and that nothing will happen unless she reaches out on her own marilyn also begins to understand that everyone has something to teach her even joy and that she needs to reach out and be there for the people around her in ways that aren t necessarily material

ex tenebris lux once again john has written a very resourceful book that is sure to solve those late night ponderings in search of the obscure see you in lodge frater 
powerful information this book is small in size but very solid in its impact it feels good and it s got a great look through out however it sometimes makes a terribly distracting sound the previous sentence seems a little strange to me but this book claims that if you were in a positive kinesthetic frame of mind when you started to read it that i was probably able to lead you through to a positive visual then on into a negative auditory and in the process i may have induced a very mild hypnotic state literally speaking directly to your unconscious system and it made sense to you on a very basic level leaving you feeling vaguely uneasy about this book that is if there is such a thing as hypnosisi don t know if the theory holds water or not i do know that i m a parent and foster parent and i was having some trouble communicating with my kids until i read this book and applied dr heller s and terry steele s techniques in each and every case within an astoundingly few minutes i was able to break their shell show them the shining light and have them making beautiful music as they travel the road to being emotionally healthy human beings another reviewer pointed out that they didn t really like the invariable misspelling of one of the quoted sources names i must be using a visual mode much more than s he because i found the constant politicaly correct use of s he and him her to be very cumbersome pick a gender already ! i was distracted by the frequent misspellings of the word will misspelled as wil too there were a few other words especially towards the end of the book that were misspelled also however once i got through monsters and magical sticks and tried what i had learned that really didn t seem to matter so much when i started reading this book i wasn t sure whether i believed in hypnosis or not turns out i do just not in the same way most people do and i know now that it s a very useful tool for helping others too ! look deeply into my eyes your eyelids are feeling very heavy you must get this book and read it ! now 
what the world needs now the skin you live in is a wonderful book for a world full of children who need to feel special and good about themselves everyone looks different on the outside but the basic human is the same on the inside this teaches children and adults with rhyme and colorful pictures about being themselves and accepting others for themselves we live in a world where hate fear and prejudice are still around please stop the cycle by reading to your child and instilling in him the joy of all the different children in the world 
well worth the read in his preface author young states parents teachers coaches business supervisors religious authorities authors and critics of all sorts inadvertently or not have been responsible for dulling aspirations and destroying dreams isn t that so true from failure andor punishment many of us are afraid to try again for those who say i can t without ever saying ill try this book s message will shake you into trying again steve young has collected over personal stories of failure from entertainers adventurers medicine politics business war and so much more a few are stories i ve heard most are new to me some writers are famous others not all have the message that failure is the best thing that ever could happen to them starting with erin brockovich the authors range from jane goodall to jamie goldman john wooden bill walton steve allen ann bancroft guy gabaldon robert townsend and sam donaldson and a whole of lot other interesting people in between the stories are all great i had to read every word this is not a book i ll pass along it will remain mine but i will tell everyone about it i liked the one about minnesota viking s jim marshall who ran the wrong way and made a touchdown for the other team he admitted his mistake learned from it and in telling others it allowed people everywhere to share mistakes they made and never told anyone about until they told marshall after the stories the second best thing is the wonderful collection of quotes focusing on failure and success the third great element is end ofchapter quickies like accidental achievements about things invented by accident unbelievable understatement and red letter rejects all about famous writers that were rejected again and again before someone finally published their work armchair interviews says an amazing collection of getoffyourduff stories to energize and support you to try again to rise from failure to success or to look at your failures in a different light 
yet another treatise by jones i won t go into great detail as other reviewers have already done that i will say that if you haven t read jone s other book the art of war in the western world you should in this book on the civil war jones discusses the war by applying all the concepts and strategies he describes in the art of war in fact the appendix in this book appears to have been lifted from the previous book no matter in the book he succinctly disects the causation and effects that bore on both sides and the resulting outcome a well written and scholarly book looking at the war from a different perspective it could be a textbook

great book for family travel in nyc our family just returned from a long weekend in nyc and this book was invaluable the book s recommendation of the doubletree hotel as the best kidfriendly place in town was right on spacious rooms modern clean and a great location the book suggested john s pizza which was another great call the pizza was great the restaurant was loud enough to handle the kids and we were able to get a table quickly on a saturday night 
heartbreaking and inspiring i ve never before read a book that contains such a wide variety of experiences writing styles and outlooks this anthology does not shy from confronting the horrors of abusive families as is evident from the first line in the book healing is my own anticolonial war but it s also incredibly inspiring for the ways that all of these children have survived to tell such wrenching stories in complex jarring ways as a parent it was difficult to get through many of the essays but always i found an incredible burst of hope when i least expected it as a survivor of childhood abuse i also could see my story being told in so many different ways unlike most books that address childhood abuse every story in this anthology is stylistically challenging innovative and carefully crafted i highly recommend it 
wow i could not put this book down its greatest power is maria laurino s honesty she gives both the quotitalianquot and quotamericanquot part of quotitalianamericansquot equal weight and deals with issues ranging from the more general such as the role of dialects faith and work in italy and america to the more specific such as how in some cases italian americans cling to traditions from their ancestors that are outdated even in italy itself while laurino spends much time discussing the differences between the north and south of italy she doesn t pit one against the other but rather looks compassionately at both sides clearly not all of her personal experiences will resonate with every italian american yet while she does not assume to know all the answers she does not shy away from the complexities and problems she confronts either in her passion to explore her own identity she brings up many important issues not only for italian americans but for other ethnicities in america as well there are so many thought provoking things about this book the type of narrative that when you read the last word you remain in a sort of daze and can t stop thinking about it it is difficult to review because i fear i will not do it justice i cannot recommend it enough 
a foundation stone for modern philosophy immanuel kant is considered one of the giants of philosophy of his age or any other it is largely this book that provides the foundation of this assessment whether one loves kant or hates him philosophically that is one cannot really ignore him even when one isn t directly dealing with kantian ideas chances are great that kant is made an impact kant was a professor of philosophy in the german city of konigsberg where he spent his entire life and career kant had a very organised and clockwork life his habits were so regular that it was considered that the people of konigsberg could set their clocks by his walks the same regularity was part of his publication history until when kant had a ten year hiatus in publishing this was largely because he was working on this book the critique of pure reason kant as a professor of philosophy was familiar with the rationalists such as descartes who founded the enlightenment and in many ways started the phenomenon of modern philosophy he was also familiar with the empiricist school john locke and david hume are perhaps the best known names in this which challenged the rationalist framework between leibniz monads and hume s development of empiricism to its logical and self destructive conclusion coupled with the romantic ideals typified by rousseau the philosophical edifice of the enlightenment seemed about to topple kant rode to the rescue so to speak he developed an idea that was a synthesis of empirical and rationalist ideas he developed the idea of a priori knowledge that coming from pure reasoning and a posterior knowledge that coming from experience and put them together into synthetic a priori statements as being possible knowledge for kant comes from a synthesis of pure reason concepts and experience pure thought and sense experience were intertwined however there were definite limits to knowledge appearance phenomenon was different from reality noumena kant held that the unknowable was the dingansich roughly translated as the thinginitself for we can only know the appearance and categorial aspects of things kant was involved heavily in scientific method including logic and mathematical methods to try to describe the various aspects of his development this is part of what makes kant difficult reading for even the most dedicated of philosophy students and readers he spends a lot of pages on logical reasoning including what makes for fallacious and faulty reasoning he also does a good deal of development on the ideas of god the soul and the universe as a whole as being essentially beyond the realm of this new science of metaphysics these are not things that can be known in terms of the spatiotemporal realm and thus proofs and constructs about them in reason are bound to fail kant does go on to attempt to prove the existence of god and the soul and other things from moral grounds but that these cannot be proved in the scientific methodology of his metaphysics and logic this book presents kant s epistemology and a new concept of metaphysics that involves transcendental knowledge a new category of concepts that aims to prove one proposition as the necessary presupposition of another this becomes the difficulty for later philosophers but it does become a matter that needs to be addressed by them as kant writes at the end of the text the critical path alone is still open if the reader has had the courtesy and patience to accompany me along this path he may now judge for himself whether if he cares to lend his aid in making this path into a high road it may not be possible to achieve before the end of the present century what many centuries have not been able to accomplish namely to secure for human reason complete satisfacton in regard to that with which it has all along so eagerly occupied itself though hitherto in vain this is heavy reading but worthwhile for those who will make the journey with kant 
great and with taste i got really really excited browsing this book there are real photos but the book is not nasty or raunchy and might serve to spice up your sex life

audio book version finally got us hooked my husband and i all are both tolkien fans but neither of us had managed to really get into the silmarillon the book s length and somewhat stiff narrative slowed us up or put us off finally we heard that the audio book version was good and thought we d give it a try while the beginning creation myth may still be a bit slow for some people the audio book version overcame many of the book s obstacles the reader has a clear sonorous english accented voice which is a perfect match with the tone of the story his commanding narration bought to life the tragic tale and completely engrossed us in the story in a way that the book failed to do 
biotech needs the immortalist manifesto brian alexander mentions the immortalist manifesto by elixxir also on amazon in his book and rightly calls it a classic what is lacking so far for biotech is a new worldview which makes sense of it and which explains its benefits and its potential to help us achieve humankind s oldest dream the conquest of old age and death the immortalist manifesto is this new post mortalist worldview we ve been waiting for read for yourself this is the book the neo luddites the vatican and the christian fundamentalist are afraid of i find it brilliant and breathtaking and inspiring brian alexander was right to call the immmortalist manifesto even this early on a classic it has the potential to do to the new biotech age what the wealth of nations and the communist manifesto did for the industrial age 
a very good book if you know what you re in for the cover of the company of strangers includes a review describing this book as casablanca seen through the eyes of john le carre i couldn t have said it better myself le carre because there is next to no edge ofyourseat suspense or hollywood ready action sequences casablanca because this novel is first and foremost a romance not an espionage or world war ii story i can appreciate how the prior reviewers who were disappointed felt misled the cover of the paperback itself strongly points to a straightforward world war ii spy tale but wilson s writing ultimately makes this a worthwhile read once those misconceptions are set aside the underlying story is that of a lifelong love affair between english and german spies that begins during world war ii of course as time goes on the necessities of war and the divided loyalties lead to various tragic results this means that on some level the book is truly guilty of being the old familiar boy meetsgirlboylosesgirlboygetsgirlback story however wilson creates so much interest in the history the locales and the lives of these people whose currency is secrets and disinformation that it nonetheless becomes compelling the book is structured like a memoir of the lead character british sis agent andrea aspinall and it does cover her entire lifetime well past world war ii because of this scope it loses pace at times and could very well have been pages shorter one of the most satisfying themes of the book is how secrecy and deception beceome guiding principles of the characters professional and personal lives often with tragic repercussions there are secrets within families between lovers and especially between competing intelligence agencies wilson certainly takes his time unraveling this tangled web but the ending is more satisfying because of it there are times along the way where the sheer number of double crosses heaped one on top of another makes it difficult to sort out the characters motivations i seriously recommend keeping some notes on character names and allegiances and using it as a bookmark as you go along it will help significantly wilsons writing is superb if also a little on the dense verbose end of the spectrum his turns of phrase on the passion and heartbreak associated with the story are probably the biggest reason that the book sustains itself so well as a romance so if you re looking for high action james bond type stuff move on if you re looking for another historical examination of the axis versus the allies move on but if you re open to investigating the human aspects of the intelligence game and the nature of personal relationships during times of war then this book is highly recommendable 
a defence of the high culture the author starts by giving a definition of the concept of culture and states his intention to pursue an archaeological method in studying his subject he then discusses the difference between cult and culture in which he sees religion as the guarantee of social knowledge and asserts that there can be no scientific culture because culture addresses the question of what we feel mr scruton then proceeds by defining the romantic movement in art and literature and linking it to the decline of christian faith and the enlightenment the aesthetic thus replacing the religious and so art and literature ceased to be recreation and became studies since the aesthetic is the realm of value the question of taste arises he underlines the importance of fiction in high culture because it is the product of the imagination art being the product of the human spirit it is higher than nature and apart from it mr scruton then concentrates on romanticism which had nature erotic love and the world before enlightenment as its dominant themes works of art also pose the question of the importance of fantasy and imagination modernism is also discussed with the example of baudelaire then avant garde and the concept of kitsch in which advertising is important because it creates a fantasy in which value can be purchased so that price and value are one and the same the author then discusses the issue that the relationship between a painting or a novel and its subject is an intentional one not a material one as opposed to photography a further topic is modern music in which it is not the music that is the focus of attention but the singer himself in the music of youth the music is at the service of the performer and not the other way round finally the author concludes that culture is rooted in religion and that the role of modern high culture is to perpetrate the common culture not as a religion but as art an interesting study of modern values and of the importance of aesthetic principles which shows that culture does not merely denote every kind of collective habit 
great book this is a great book easy to read and very insightful on the subject of being welcoming to guests in the church i highly recommend it for anyone in the hospitality ministry 
homage to hiv shilts great book shows us how much of the aids related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided the book opens with the july th bicentennial celebration of american independence and closes with the death of hollywood star rock hudson whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous aids casualties could not in between the book revolves around the hedonistic community of san francisco s castro street area and brings us an amazing array of villains victims and plain heroes the villains include the bathhouse owners who used america s first amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus dr bob gallo of america s national cancer institute who put his own prestige ahead of everything else normal scientific and academic ethics included and the reagan administration which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted america during those years because the air bridges between los angeles new york and san francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed shilts also introduces us to gaetan dugas the canadian air line steward who is credited with infecting many of america s earliest victims shilts paints him as half victim and half villain dugas he shows went from being the pretty boy everybody in castro street wanted to bed to being the terminal aids case they all eventually feared rock hudson liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims michael foucault the fashionable french philosopher must rank with the vilest villains he hid his diagnosis from everyone even his devoted lover so much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer but even in the blighted world of aids there were many heroes these include the french scientists who discovered the hiv virus and gallo excepted the american ones who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness many of these american heroes shilts shows were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind the bathhouse chain owners who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming aids were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years the blood banks by refusing to screen blood also contributed to the death of thousands of americans the reagan administration s preoccupation with central america and the soviet union was also a godsend to the virus and as the band played on aids wormed its way through america s marginalized communities of hookers hemophiliacs heroin addicts and haitians gay activists who tried to sound the alarm bells were dismissed as sexual nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in castro street s backroom bars and bathhouses even though as shilts constantly reminds us it meant almost certain death shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril aids means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later the world s legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for aids hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues so too will other marginalized and uneducated people so too of course will people like robert gallo who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity son the positive side the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes not the least of whom is randy shilts who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity

great my mother told me to read this book about ten years ago when i was the same age as carrie i rarely listened to her i do now always listen to your mother so she read me the first few lines and i had to pick it up something about a girl of eighteen and how she might fare alone in nineteenth century chicago intrigued me there was a hint that she might go bad ! so of course i had to pick it up besides i ll read almost anything which you can see from my various reviews i found i couldn t put it down this is a great melodrama about a harsh and sprawling metropolis at the turn of the century and like dreiser s other work it s also a story of the viciousness darwinian nature of capitalism in this case he looks at the story through the eyes of a pretty young woman who comes to the city by herself young carrie called sister carrie in homey fashion by her rural family to show the sweet origins of what ultimately becomes a not sorespectable woman carrie trying to become an actress relies on sexuality to survive it s suggested that she doesn t have much of a choice and that everyone is for sale in the city preyed on by more sophisticated men she ultimately becomes successful in her own right this leaves us with a sort of confusion weve grown to symapthize with carrie and understand her behavior is a survival mechanism but she is also callous and begins to change from victim to conniver at the end we aren t sure whether to cheer her triumph or feel bad for those she s left in her wake another entertaning great dreiser story that will teach you about american urban history not to mention keep you turning the pages in great suspense as to what will become of lovely young carrie thanks mom

great new genre cussler has created i just read through the first two oregon books and was looking for the third in the series i noticed from the reviews on it that mr cussler has listened to the whiners and changed the series what a shame ! no this is not a dirk pitt book he is still doing those for people who need a mindless read if you enjoy reading the exact same formula over and over and over and over dirk pitt is still there for you he s even been joined by kurt austin so you don t have to wait so long for a new book to come out the dirk pitt and numa files books have their place and i enjoy them for what they are good simple entertainment but for those of us who appreciate something more the oregon series is a whole new revelation it is mission impossible on the high seas mr cussler had created a whole new sub genre to the adventure novel like a great movie i have spent the past weeks reading and re reading golden buddha and sacred stone to get every last morsel that is in them they are adventure books for thinkers i was surpised to read on here that this book had no suspense it has tons of suspense ! with all that is going on you are always surprised at what pops up next yet it all comes together eventually unlike the dirk pitt novels you can t guess what is coming before you pick the book up from cover to cover the reader is kept guessing at what is going to happen to crew and how they will overcome the obstacles that crop up will they make it throught the sewers before the dye and the police catch up with them will they have to alter their plans due to the flooding will someone on the crew die in the escape suspenseful the oregon files books are the finest new series i ve read in years i hope that mr cussler and his publisher have looked beyond those who complain that they have to think to read this book and leave the other two series to them you have something truly special here keep the oregon files as they are in the first two books you do that and i ll buy every one you put out more than once too because i ll be giving the books away for others to read the books are perfect one suggestion though how about a lit version to keep on my computer i m running out of shelf space with all the physical versions i ve bought

one of wells better works of fiction william leadford is a young london socialist leading a life of quiet desperation around him the whole world seems to be unraveling as capitalist wage war on their own workers and nation rises up against nation and through it all a comet has entered the solar system and may indeed be aimed straight at earth can the system that dominates men s lives survive its seeming inevitable destruction and if the comet should strike the planet what will be the result this now largely forgotten work was written by h g wells in during his brief sojourn with the fabian society this book is less science fiction than his earlier works such as the invisible man and the war of the worlds and is more of a political polemic in it we get to see the inevitable destruction of the capitalist system that the antediluvian socialists predicted but more wells uses the comet as a vehicle to posit a new utopia where man has awakened from his childhood as a species and puts behind him such things as private ownership of land nationalism religion and so much more indeed this book marks wells open advocation of free love which eroded his popularity among the reading public now as for the book itself i am of two minds the book starts out rather slowly and i found myself rather bored with it but as it continued it began to pick up steam and became quite an interesting read this is one of wells better works of fiction being much better in my opinion than tono bungay and the food of the gods so if you are a fan of edwardian literature or just like a good story then you will definitely like this book i highly recommend it

a great book for the true jazz lover while a student in professor walser s jazz class at ucla i was one of several students lucky enough to have read every chapter before it made it to press every chapter was like a time machine transporting us back in time to an era where racism and sexism took a toll on some musicians while only strengthening the resolve of others this book was at the time one of the best readings i had done in a long time in reading direct quotes from the greats of music you couldn t help but feel a bit inspired quotkeeping in time quot is a gem and should be assigned reading to anyone studying jazz or just wanting to learn more about the many performers who played or sang that one song you liked differently professor walser certainly knows his subject matter well and in my case he certainly excelled in the one thing he likes to do teach 
excellent this book is excellent ! if you don t have a finance background but need to understand the financial statements this book will teach you everything you need if you already know about finance this book will teach you what you don t know

dark magick lets start and say right away that this grimoire does not match the power and force in some of the older grimoires that said then why do i like it konstantinos finds a subtle element in the night in the power of darkness which i personally have been attracted to since a child perhaps the key to this grimoire is not whether a particular rite or spell works but rather whether the author can weave his love of the night into one s mind which he does magick is a very subtle force and sometimes such weaving can have as powerful affect as full blast magick from an older grimoire 
this is the story of the clintons before the american people were forewarned long ago that this was no ordinary if there could be such a description political couple james b stewart delineates the machinations that typified the clinton story throughout bill clinton s arkansas governorship now a lot of this is intertwined with the peculiarities of arkansas society where it seems everybody knows everybody else no offense to many decent arkansans much of my family hails from there and this may be why kenneth starr was not able to find solid evidence of wrongdoing although he obtained several convictions of clinton associates yet to many of us whitewater was a real estate deal a sitting state attorney general and later governor would not touch with a ten or even a twenty foot pole and that goes double for castle grande cattle futures and madison guaranty trust under other circumstances an office holder would have put his or her assets into a blind trust this intrigue has continued into bill clinton s presidency and beyond white house coffees stayovers in the lincoln bedroom selling of sensitive technological information for campaign contributions selling of pardons the sneaking of antiques out of the white house the financing of the chappaqua house purchase and hillary rodham clinton s registry with several department stores in the manner of an expectant bride note that for her actual wedding in she bought her wedding dress off the rack at dillard s the day before and those are just the financial intrigues ! 
my spirit guide i love all of sylvie s books they are very informative and enlighting 
highly detailed framework for team development overview the wisdom of teams presents katzenbach and smith s contention that real teams are the best approach to building a high performance organization the authors blended together their highly detailed framework for team development with examples of how several corporations successfully or unsuccessfully implemented these team principles while acknowledging that teams may not be the best solution for every organization s problems the authors unashamedly insisted that businesses do themselves a disservice by not considering the team based approach the book s twelve chapters are organized into three parts understanding teams becoming a team and exploiting the potential summarypart one understanding teams introduces the reader to the authors thesis that teams present the best approach to creating a high performance organization teams are defined as a small group of people with complementary skills committed to a common purpose and set of specific performance goals teams are not the same as work groups committees councils or task forces where the emphasis is on individual performance and accountability that is the sum of individual bests neither is every group that calls itself a team a true team they may exhibit team like characteristics or share team like values but those in and of themselves do not make a team the distinguishing characteristic of teams is the synergistic effect created when individual accountability is exchange for mutual group accountability and shared group responsibility additionally teams need to do real work in order be characterized as a real team they must produce a specific work product that contributes to the organization s mission and success however achieving real team status is often difficult in order to become successful potential teams must overcome bureaucratic inertia managerial biases confusion about what makes a true team negative past experiences with pseudo teams fear of failure and individual resistance to shared accountability these embody a daunting array of factors to overcome but the authors insisted that a top level commitment to team based solutions could lead to building a successful team in part two becoming a team the authors used their team performance curve to graphically illustrate the process necessary to create winning teams a group does not become a team when initially formed they may be a working group committed to better coordinating individual efforts toward individual goals benefiting the company but they produce no joint work product while this may be the best solution to a company s problem the decision to become a team requires the conscious decision to assume the risk of mutual accountability and joint responsibility if provided the right catalyst a working group can transition to either a pseudo team or a potential team the pseudo team fails to implement the basics of team building they call themselves a team but are still focused on individual performance and not group results potential teams show an enhanced desire to formulate a group mission but have not adopted mutual accountability they demonstrate improved team effectiveness but their impact on the corporate problem is no greater than the working group real teams have a clearly defined mission for which they hold themselves mutually accountable and produce a joint work product high performance teams are real teams that develop a deep personal commitment among the members of the team for one another s personal growth and wellbeing these teams are both highly effective in their team effort and produce high quality results for the organization however to rise to that level team members must make the critical choice to invest themselves in the team and its mission while overcoming obstacles that threaten to cause the team to regress to one of its lesser effective counterparts successful teams need quality leaders who help focus the group on the mission endorse a team based philosophy of shared accountability and foster a climate of courage and success in part three the authors forcefully championed their assertion that teams are the building blocks of successful organizations teams they insisted are the best organizational tool to deliver the results necessary to build customer loyalty shareholder value and employee satisfaction provided a company has a strong performance ethic and vision driven leadership teams can contribute the necessary skills energy and performance values that drive successful businesses the ultimate decision to incorporate functional team rests with executive leadership and its willingness to transform bloated hierarchical structures managerial parochialism and individual based incentives review and reaction brevity and succinctness are not the strengths of this book once one is able to navigate the business techno babble the mind numbing repetitiousness and awkward sentence structures the authors point becomes clear teams are good for business the genuine strength of the book is in the examples the authors ethereally academic presentation of team concepts finds a clearer voice in their reflections on how these concepts were applied in real world corporate environments while not every example speaks with equal adequacy to its point the reader can gain an understanding of what factors help build or break teams many of these factors as the authors asserted are common sense

short stories this is a wonderful book of short stories that are funny and witty he wrote them so they are not obviously funny but in their own way a secret beauty for example take the story about the astrologer where there is all this extra info and it does not seem to go anywhere but then when you read through it you thoroughly enjoy the story i do not in any way mean to imply that the extraneous details are boring when he leads up to the climax it still is interesting all i mean is that it may get oh so very slightly confusing take another one of his stories a story about a dog who is trained to be a watchdog the whole story is ironical for when a burglar enters the house the dog only licks him and goes along with the robber away from the owner his stories are all slightly similar but yet vastly different almost anyone can enjoy this book cheers an year old reader 
best book available on subject the late aryeh kaplan was a rabbi scholar and kabbalist in addition to his valuable and readable commentaries on sefer yetzirah and sefer bahir he wrote three books on meditation the other two are meditation and kabbalah and meditation and the bible from a practical perspective jewish meditation is far and away the best however reading the other two provides one with a more inclusive theoretical background and context within which to practice this volume is quite valuable and a contribution to both meditation per se and to jewish spiritual practices it s rare to find an author who is both scholar and practitioner so kaplan s books on meditation and on kabbalah are particularly valuable and accessible to the reader of course they are not introductory books of which there are innumerable versions in bookstores it helps to have a solid background in the basics before tackling kaplan s texts but it isn t essential kaplan s texts are appropriate to both the serious student and the serious practitioner of meditation and of kabbalah they also demonstrate to contemporary people that judaism is more than just laws and books and that spiritual practices are indeed the heart of judaism as they are with other religions and belief systems r kaplan s tragic death in an automobile accident was a great loss to jewish understanding as well as more generically to kabbalah meditation and modern spirituality

an ideology that threatens progressive western civilization an extremely important book every american should read this book especially government policy makers so that lessons can be learned and our enemies better understood wright has skillfully written a highly readable account of the major players and events leading up to with the fall of the ottoman empire and with it the caliphate the seeds of the modern radical islamic supremacist movement was born saayid qtub one of the founders of the muslim brotherhood movement in egypt and his motivations are fleshed out as well as how it led to the fanaticism of people like the blind sheik al zawahiri and bin laden and scores of followers in addition wright describes the key figures in the nsa cia and fbi those charged with preserving our national security and exposes the institutinalized dysfunctional culture that impeded the work of people like john o neill and the fbis counter terrorism department wright describes in detail the wall between government agencies how vital information that the cia had that may have enabled the fbi to foil the plot was with held because of fear that future prosecutions would disclose methods and sources that were essential for ongoing cia operations although this book is quite an achievement and an important read i have subtracted one star because of some concerns i believe where possible there should have been sources included so that the reader would know where wright obtained information and how he came to some conclusions by the same token there is some detail in this book that i wonder is appropriate to disclose as the struggle against the fanaticism that brought us goes on some in the media although i am not suggesting wright is necessarily one of them believes they are journalists first and americans second i think some need to be reminded that it is the american system that provides them the freedom to be the journalists that that they want to be and wright in my opinion wanders dangerously close to comparing john o neill to bin laden pointing out at one point that o neil was praying times a day and that he had several love interests at once similar to bin ladens religious practices and his polygamy i was disturbed by the comparisons and it made me wonder what was wright s point these similarities are about as relevant to their motivations and morality as the fact that they both have two arms and two legs john o neil and bin laden are at opposite ends of the morality spectrum o neil is a true hero going beyond the call to protect his fellow citizens bin laden is determined to destroy progressive western culture unfortunately i have noticed a tendency to minimalize the virtue of our progressive culture we must be clear about what we are defending if bin laden and his movement has his way freedom of speach religious freedoms women s rights gay rights etc will recede and there will be what some have called a reprimitivization of the west our culture is worth defending and we need to give those charged with its defense enough trust and slack to accomplish the job they deserve no less than our support and our gratitude

democracy lost i found this to be a fascinating book well researched and documented mr nace traces the history of the american corporations from the earliest years of our union it would be easy to draw the conclusion that mr nace is anti business but that is not how i read his position instead what he is suggesting is that we have created a monster with our catering to the personhood of corporations at the expense of focused small businesses the premise is that corporations have now gained more rights than human persons have in our society along with longevity corporations need not die corporations have gained other rights not available to people according to mr nace corporations enjoy a long list of such rights limited liability for shareholders perpetual existence virtual location indefinite entity or shape shifting minimum standard of treatment national treatment and compensation for regulatory takings such as nafta rulings etc in addition we have allowed corporations to enjoy rights equal to those of people such as equal protection due process freedom from unreasonable search jury trial in a criminal case compensation for government takings freedom from double jeopardy jury trial in a civil case commercial speech political speech negative speech the right to abstain from association with the speech of others armed with these rights and deep pockets many corporations are formidable opponents in competing with people for resources political access and redress of real or perceived injustices nace argues that without restriction of companies through the corporate charter articles of incorporation we have turned a monster loose on society which we are now almost powerless to contain corporations have lives of their own and little to fear from governments they simply do business elsewhere should they find the environment undesirable the consequences of this evolved capitalist model are that we have a concentration of power and a polarization of wealth the most insidious result of this creation is that democracy is no longer in the hands of the people it is in the hands of large corporations and big government which is now a big business they have no incentive to relinquish their power mr nace does not recommend radical solutions to this situation instead he advocates the more hopeful scenario in which the pendulum swings toward a softer variant of corporate capitalism under this course the corporation as we know it does not radically change but society gets better at pushing back against its influence and excesses environmental regulation becomes stricter wealth taxes blunt the worst extremes of wealth and poverty antitrust regulations break up the largest corporate empires restrictions on corporate political activity revitalize democratic institutions regardless of your position on business in general or big business in particular this book will provide food for thought and you will gain knowledge of how we have come to be in this place

a feast for the minds eye one cannot write about this book without referring to the the animated film a scanner darkly it has an astonishing combination of great storytelling filmmaking acting and computer graphic skills the animation brought to life by a procedure called rotoscoping doesn t resemble anything a computer might have created indeed given the glut of computer technology in film these days a scanner darkly has a rather restrained quality instead of a showy cgi motion picture the great work of master illustrators makes the film work well from beginning to end the artwork serves the story well and never detracts from the plot in addition the films score is unforgettable it doesn t take long to figure out why either with artists like radiohead thom yorke and the golden arm trio one can t help recognize it as inspired music scored by graham reynolds the musical shades of a dark unsure time and place give way on occasion to blitheness when put together it is a feast for the eyes ears and brain a perfect blend of all one sees and hears in this masterpiece mislaid through word ofmouth a scanner darkly is gaining a wider audience daily it has the power to attract and hold ones interest it is one of those films destined to become a classic and in the future people will recognize how worthy of notice it is and will remain now as for the book it is a feast for the minds eye it tells the story using the artwork from the film it is a scanner darkly in comic form thought bubbles and everything i can t think of anything more delicious from the cover to the story and the artwork within it s a beautiful book my only criticism with the copy i got from amazon has to do with the print and the size of the book that is the drawings are a bit dark and the book is a bit small for my taste because it is printed on a high quality flat paper rather than glossy paper could be the reason the artwork is dark i think glossy paper would have given the book a unique luster that would have added to the visual experience and perhaps brightened the drawings who knows in addition a magazine likesized hardback might have made it easier to hold then again the odd size might have been a deliberate choice to throw the reader off just as the story itself does even so this is a great read and souvenir of philip k dick s wonderful story and linklater s film with all i ve said this book is still a great buy i recommend the movie the soundtrack the book and anything else you can get your hands on 
disregard david foley david foley s response is typical of the self important know itall westerner tell any amount of lies about calcutta to these people as the charity industry does all the time and they ll believe it some of them will send money to mother teresa with tears flowing from their eyes a few might even pack their bags and go out to save the poor heathens from themselves as foley seems to have done but say one good thing about calcutta and the foleys of the world will condemn you for being nationalistic or worse judge krishna dutta s book on its merits not on the basis of what some self appointed western pundit thinks 
cool kitchens this book contains an excellent collection of photos of arts crafts period kitchens it discusses the philosophy of design gustav stickley and others advocated and shows you the results which are still beautiful even after all these years it is a little short on detail if you wanted to reproduce the look of the arts crafts kitchen but it does spark the imagination the examples of various kitchens is broken down by designer so it is easy to pick out their specific design influence i found this book an inspiration for some of the designs i would like incorporate in my own home and combined with some other books of design details it is excellent

body versus mind the fairly plain life of scott carey this book s title character gets unusual when he starts to shrink by one seventh of an inch per day after being exposed to radiations despite the efforts of various doctors no cure is in sight this bodily transformation doesn t do much to his mind though many times smaller scott still is pervaded by the same desires mostly sexual in fact if his situation irritates him at first it s mainly since he becomes smaller than his wife he feels more like a boy than a man financial problems resurface as he can t work for his brother anymore by being reduced to such a little size he now has to think something which he wasn t used to predictably it makes him uncomfortable less than one inch tall and the prisoner of his house s cave the end seems near but when the occasion of getting out arises he can t resist and is lead by pure exhaltation no longer afraid of death after a night of sleep he wakes up in a whole new world which marks the next step of his voyage for this to be possible his body had to be reduced to almost nothing 
for stillman fans who just can t get enough until i read the above reviews i never even realized that this book might be meant for university courses ! the writing is so fresh and fun and accessible that i d just assumed it was for stillman fans like me who after watching each of his films multiple times still crave more ! until stillman comes out with a new film books about the old films will just have to suffice i suppose this is a very readable book if you like me just can t get enough of whit stillman you ll enjoy this book the only reason i gave it stars instead of is that i really disagree with some of the authors on some points some of the reasoning seems a bit forced example audrey decided to accompany cynthia to rick van sloneker s for the express purpose of seeing if tom would come rescue her give me a break still overall it s a great read if you ve seen all the films

good book on fundamental analysis don t be put off by the rather cheesy title this is a very good book on fundamental analysis the author has a very readable style assumes no prior knowledge of accounting or ability to read financial statements the only pre requisite is a healthy dose of common sense the book is very readable and very suitable for a beginning investor intermediate investors will find much of the material familiar but will find some new things to pick up the only negatives i can find about the book is that it is somewhat disorganized i also would have preferred the author focus solely on value investing and make the treatment more complete by discussing and building discounted cashflow models

journey into healing this book uses poetry as an introduction to its prose reflections reflections which consist of spiritual meditations commentary thought provoking questions and personal biblical interpretation the author as she did in her book sacred voices focuses on the perspectives of women this time moving beyond genesis to include esther hannah ruth and naomi the book is intended to help people as they like their biblical ancestors struggle with the age old problem of pain the poetry is not particularly sonorous but it does grapple with heavy themes and it serves as a solid jumping board for the author s reflections

no pain no gain go for the straight and narrow the reviewer that refers to this book as being painful is partly right this book is difficult to read that s for sure however leadership as a topic is not simple there are no quick fixes to learn about leadership you will have to read a lot particularly what the researchers have written the topic is not simple and certainly cannot be summarized in simple graphs or charts you ll need some level of intelligence to understand the nature of leadership managers or students who have some basic education will be able to understand this book if you are looking for quick stories this book is not for you reading who moved my cheese or good to great will be a better fit for you these types of books are certainly easier however these kinds of books are very simplistic and not well researched even though they pretend to be if you want to get fit there is not simple way to do it you have to watch what you eat you have to exercise you need persistence and you need to work hard if you are the type of person that believes in working hard then this book is for you you are the type that likes to take the straight and narrow way you believe in no pain no gain

an entertaining guide to the mistooks of our time this book is an entertaining and informative look of some of the major fiascoes of american popular history i have witnessed or at least heard about the majority of the mistakes displayed here for example i remember seeing the john hancock tower partially covered in plywood on childhood trips to boston although the book doesn t mention this i believe that the surviving panes of glass went to building a locally famous salvage overstock store here in the boston area for sale for the uses described by the authors the authors do a good job in filling out the facts behind the fiascoes i didn t realize that i wasn t the only one who couldn t stand clippy as a previous reviewer stated the one problem that i did have with the book is a lack of a photo section as items such as paper dresses the dodge lafemme the rockin tacoma narrows bridge flying cars need to be seen i also didn t care too much for the receipe section that ended each chapter despite this i do recommend this book to be added to your own dynamic file of trivia 
great read chapel noir is a great read i ve never read any irene adler mysteries and i actually picked up the book because jack the ripper was named on the cover and was greatly suprised i couldn t put the book down and quickly became attached to the characters and the story line beware though if you read chapel noir you ll have to read castle rouge because where chapel noir ends castle rouge begins i hope ms douglas doesn t wait another seven years to write another irene nell and godfrey adventure in the meantime i ll have to go back to the beginning and try to find the first books of the series 
a gentle guide to expanded awareness this is a wonderful book which helps you expand your awareness using the tools of meditation a psychic journal grounding auras chakras spiritual guides and many other things the author helps you along the psychic pathway clearly written with very useful exercises she nudges you along gently rather than overwhelming you with psychic mumbo jumbo in fact at the beginning of the book she tires to dispel preconceived notions that psychics are weird or charletons and she does indeed convince you she is the real thing by her genuineness and honesty i was particularly helped by her teaching that we have the intuition and insight to make our own judgements and should not give away our power to others be unduly influenced by family and friends we must take responsibility for our own lives and not expect others to take care of us sonia shows us that by working diligently but at our own pace we can indeed greatly expand our awareness

mayra calvani since its creation in by pulp writer johnston mcculley the character of zorro has captured the hearts and imaginations of young and old alike the infamous romantic hero has been played by numerous actors through the decades from douglas fairbanks jr in the s to antonio banderas in the late s now isabel allende born in peru and raised in chile bestselling author of highly acclaimed literary works such as the house of the spirits adds intricate texture and a new dimension to the legend by blending the two things she is best known for magic realism and historical fiction born to alegandro de la vega a spanish aristocrat and toypurnia a shoshone indian warrior diego de la vega aka zorro or fox in spanish is a product of his mixed heritage his grandmother white owl a healer and shaman plays an enormous role in the formation of his character at an early age while witnessing the injustice committed against indians his alter ego begins to show as he becomes increasingly obsessed with justice together with his inseparable mute friend and milk brother bernardo diego is initiated into manhood in the indian tradition and it is during this experience that he comes into contact with his spirit totem the fox at sixteen diego is sent to barcelona for a classical education and while perfecting the art of fencing with manuel escalante becomes a member of the secret society la justicia where he pledges to seek justice nourish the hungry clothe the naked protect widows and orphans give shelter to the stranger and never spill innocent blood during this time zorro falls hopelessly in love with juliana de romeu becomes best friends with her sister isabel has a duel with rafael moncada and organizes several rescue missions in the midst of political upheaval eventually together with juliana and isabel he s forced to leave barcelona in disguise they walk across spain live with gypsies and are captured by pirates to diego s chagrin juliana succumbs to pirate jean latiffee s charms eventually diego and isabel make it back to california where diego s father has been imprisoned on charges of treason as if this isn t enough his mortal enemy rafael moncada has followed him here seeking revenge theres no doubt allende is a gifted consummate teller of tales under her pen alta california and napoleonic spain come alive in their most vivid historical detail from the modest adobe houses and exotic war paint on indian faces to the filthy excrement filled dungeons and the black eyes of gypsies to the sparkling diamonds against the plump white dcollet of spanish belles allende offers us a vibrant saga dripping with adventure romance history politics and a touch of magic its a pity though that allende spends a large part of the book in the trivial barbara cartland style romance between juliana and jean latiffe while zorro assumes a secondary nearly silent role to the point where one has to wonder whose story is being told like many other latin american writers gabriel garcia marquez among them allende uses the omniscient point of view and her paragraphs are long and almost entirely devoid of dialogue this evokes a magical quality the sensation of sitting in front of a bonfire while listening to an old and wise storyteller but at the same time causes a lack in dramatization one can t help thinking that allende has so many stories to tell that if she added dialogue the book would easily turned into a one thousand page manuscript of course the lack in dialogue and so much telling rather than showing pertains to style and not to a lack of literary skill another interesting aspect of allende s writing is the power she gives to most of her female characters damsels in distress not in this novel ! the women here are wilful intelligent individuals to be reckoned with allende also keeps the identity of the narrator a mystery until the last chapter though allende ultimately fails in lifting zorro from his place as a two dimensional comical character her remarkable prose and action packed story make this book a pleasure to read 
our daughter is living proof this works this book is great and the technique really works i saw this book on a talk show and decided to try it with my month old she caught on very quickly and soon we were both coming up with new signs we also would teach our daycare provider the new signe we learned and soon all the babie in the nursery were modeling her one day one of the parents of another child asked the daycare provider if she knew what thier daughter was doing when she pointed to the middle of her palm the classic sign for more when they realized she had picked this up from my daughter everyone was amazed i believe things happened by using baby signs my baby toddler was happier becuase we could acurately determine what her needs were as well as communicate about the world around her she was far advanced verbally to children her own age when she started talking it was almost in complete sentances this is discussed in the book as a byproduct of the technique i give this book to every expectant mother i know along with what to expect when you re expecting 
richard bernstein on evil in the post world this is a very necessary book it upends the simplistic desire to polarize everything us vs them good vs evil the coalition of the willing vs the axis of evil and in doing so creates a much more complex awareness of evil in all its radical otherness i liked this short book so much that i went on to read bernstein s radical evil a philosophical interrogation where he deals with issues more in depth with critical chapters on freud nietzsche arendt schelling levinas kant etc i particularly liked his lines interrogating evil is an ongoing open ended process evil is an excess that resists total comprehension evil resists all attempts to justify it it resists theodicy and the power of evil and the human propensity to commit evil deeds must not be underestimated 
roald dahl a surprise within a surprise ever since i read his taste i seem not to get enough of dahl s stories incredible imagination wit and culture all throughout my uncle oswald which i m about to finish i not only get amazed by the story itself but i also get much amused by its parallel inputs such as which wines go well with determined foods i don t even know if such descriptions actually exist but i sure can taste them ! well besides that i think it great literature as well he is a good writer i mean was unfortunately ! 
understand american intervention and its consequences certainly an interesting and powerfully argued examination of united states policies of global intervention and their consequences certainly most americans take for granted the necessity of our global outreach as stated by professor johnson while taking for granted the presence of our military on the foreign soil of other sovereign nations an american could not even imagine the intrusion upon our land by another military while we americans often do not even stop to ponder why we have troops in japan germany italy indonesia saudi arabia etc professor johnson goes a step further to remind us that there are no german indonesian russian greek or japanese troops on italian soil this sets the backdrop for his text which shows that the u s in its role as the lone global superpower has involvement in many countries that leads to unintended and often deleterious consequences reading this book i could not help but be reminded of the book imperial hubris by anonymous michael scheuer i personally do feel that professor johnson s arguments for reeling in american global intervention imperialism are one sided and supported by the examples of blowback or deleterious unintended consequences the contention can be made that the position of economic preeminence enjoyed by the u s today is precisely a result of its global intervention imperialism with that thought in mind i take the teaching points of this book in stride to wonder if the u s would be able to maintain its position as the indispensable nation and perhaps even strengthen it by demobilization in some areas 
do we love across time or in spite of it as someone who finds the supernatural absolutely fascinating i have always found picoult s novels intriguing however unlike some of her other works this novel is a slow starter no less than characters are introduced in the first few chapters of the book and it is sometimes tedious to remember who is who that being said the characters finally begin to mesh and flow the dross drains away and the pure gold of picoult s writing talent emerges as a hopeful romantic i am drawn to the main character ross wakeman who has experienced love so profound it permeates to the bone once love on that level is experienced and then lost life s orchestral crescendo fades into a single note of woeful desperation and despondency a suicide attempt seems the only answer not once not twice but thrice the enthralling encounter that enables ross to knit together the broken pieces of his life is central to the plot of the book and every bit as exciting as the ghosts who also haunt the pages ultimately ross learns the enigmatic truth that life isn t defined by the moment one dies but by all the moments one truly lives true love is like ghosts which everybody talks about and few have ever seen

the death of classics and classical education hanson and heath describe in devastating detail the unfortunate turn to obscurity and irrelevance taken by the new generation of classics departments under the influence of postmodernist and radical leftist trends in the university while similar problems afflict other areas in the liberal arts the authors explain why it is particularly troubling in the case of classics arguing passionately for the importance of understanding the ancient greek and roman heritage of western civilization one cannot help but agree with their critique as well as with the basic recommendation of restoring knowledge of the classics to the average university student however the authors go too far in advising that the entire university curriculum be restructured around the classics including the learning of greek and latin although hanson and heath are no doubt correct in insisting that the classics are best understood when read in their original languages they can be understood well enough in translation and while the authors are equally right that learning a difficult language like greek helps one to develop a logical and disciplined mind this objective would be accomplished as well through increased emphasis on mathematics which would also have more practical dividends on the whole a very interesting book though somewhat over the top readily recommended to anyone interested in the direction university education is going 
marvelous adaption for younger readers this review refers to the great illustrated classic edition listed for ages of frankenstein by mary shelleyi had to surf the various editions of frankenstein to find this one which is wonderfully adapted for older kids by malvina g vogel and illustrated by pablo marcus studio there were many editions to go through and if you are interested in this one make sure you are on the page with the isbn of playmore publishers june you can enter the number in the book search the cover has a fiery orange background with frankenstein running in a wooded area only available at this time from the outside merchants you may want to check with them by e mail to make sure which edition they are selling the customer reviews as well as the editorial reviews seemed to be all lumped together the children s issues along with the adult editions malvina vogel has done a fabulous adaption for younger readers to be able to enjoy this very frightening but most captivating classic it is still the story we all love of victor frankenstein who loved science and life when a life of a loved one is lost he vows to discover a way that no one will ever have to face the grief that death brings about he works and studies furiously to the point of obsession until finally his labors prove it can be done invent life out of various body parts from corpses but his creation turns out to be monstrous a giant creature that seeks revenge on victor for creating the hideous and terrifying being he has become the path of the monster is covered with dead bodies those of the people closest to victor victor now has a new mission in life to hunt the creature down and destroy him before the monster unleashes his vengeance on any more innocents the monster is portrayed with feelings of hating himself for what he has done and there are times you may even feel a twinge of pity for him the entire story unfolds wonderfully and in a way children will get caught up in as victor near death and after chasing the monster through the iciest and coldest regions known to man reveals for the first time to an explorer also obsessed and risking lives how his creation came to be tthe books has fairly large print excellent and somewhat scary illustrations with captions on every other page at nearly pages it is a quick read and one that kids will be turning the pages enthusiastically the school journal editorial here say the illustrations are in color however in this edition they are black and white drawings there is also a page bio on mary shelley at the opening i think the age group recommended here is pretty close although may be a little too young just from a reading comprehension standpoint of course it depends on the child and may be a little young for a cut off i think even older kids and even the parents reading with the child will enjoy this adaption a great gift book for your favorite reader enjoylauri 
very good book i michael l rayborn did not write that reveiw below despite my known interest in the reavers of northumbria which is where my ancestors came from i am not the only person in the heathen movement that is interested in that i do not agree with what the reveiwer wrote below as i have always enjoyed swain wodenings works and direct everyone interested in the anglo saxon way to his website www ealdrihtorg all of his works are very researched and i would not even dream of detracting anyone from them bottom line i highly recommend this book 
classic theology classic literature john calvin s institutes of the christian religion is a monumental work that stands among the greatest works of christian theology and western literature it ranks with works such as st augustine s confessions and city of god in value insight and significance the institutes have molded the church s understanding of christian doctrine for generations and has had untold influence in the development of western thought in both the religious and civil arenas calvins institutes represent his life work in teaching theology they first appeared in and went through three significant revisions each expanding and building upon the previous this particular edition represents the final form and of which calvin was very pleased originally written to give basic understanding of christian doctrine they became one of the earliest systematic theologies of the reformed tradition calvin s stated desire is to give the reader the necessary background to read and accurately handle the great doctrines and promises of the bible calvin sent a copy to the king francis i to encourage him to stop persecuting the christians who were embracing the gospel as taught by the reformers his basic argument was that if the king understood what these people believed he would stop killing them as heretics but rather see them as faithful adherents of historical christianity calvin was no lover of novelty and throughout the institutes copiously sights from the early church fathers and the long history of the church s understanding of doctrine this two volume work is broken down into four books that loosely follow the outline of the apostle s creed book concerns knowledge of god book is about jesus christ as redeemer book is about the holy spirit s role in applying christ s redeeming graces book is about the church and practice this particular edition translated by battles and edited by mcneil is more expensive than the one produce by beverage but it is worth every extra dollar you spend while the church is indebted to beverage for his labor of love in getting many works by calvin translated into english his command of both french and latin were not as strong as battles in fact beverage does not even deal with calvin s latin version of the institutes they were originally produced in both latin and french and battles work demonstrates his competency in dealing with both languages also battles mastery of calvin s other writings is reflected in his voluminous footnotes many of them very helpful to the reader for clarifying further reading and cross referencing in addition the indexes in the battles edition are invaluable not only for searching the institutes for topics but for gleaming calvin s understanding of the church fathers agree or disagree with calvin these are a necessary read for anyone who desires an understanding of the development of western thought literature and theology they are not only great theology they represent excellent writing and development of an argument they are also highly pastoral and devotional they are not like reading a modern systematic theology calvin understood doctrine to be more than theory but something to mold our understanding of god ourselves and the world in which we live carefully working through the institutes is a journey worth taking soli deo gloria 
a room with a view is a delightful novel a room with a view is a delightful novel by e m forster is is a bit of a romance and was probably realistic fiction in the time period in which it was written the main character is a young lady named lucy lucy and her cousin charlotte have traveled to italy and they meet a lot of interesting characters in their hotel the emersons are a middle class father and son who offer to give up their rooms to the ladies because the rooms have wonderful views lucy learns a lot in italy about herself and upon returning home becomes engaged to cecil vyse the emersons and cecil have dramatic effects upon lucy s life after she returns home she discovers conflicting love within her life and she learns that home is a lot less perfect than she had always pictured it to be lucy observes that even their church had lost its charm and the thing one never talked about religionwas fading like all other things lucy struggles to find out who she is what she wants and if the rules of society are to be followed in all aspects of her own life lucy finally discovers her beliefs and decides whether or not to follow the trends and manners of society i would rate this book relatively highly it is only two hundred and thirty pages long but the language is difficult it is a good book because the reader can relate to the characters and because it is a romance which most girls like to read however there is quite a bit of philosophy which makes it hard to understand and it is written in the language style of the nineteenth century i had to read some of the paragraphs multiple times to grasp their meaning wrestling with the language is a good vocabulary and thinking exercise however a room with a view is a good novel to read but the language makes it a lengthy and difficult book to understand 
provocative and fresh this is a book with a dual mission though it certainly addresses itself to the french american artist louise bourgeois s mysterious and beautiful quotspiderquot series of sculptures it is just as much about the quotexperiencingquot of artworks in real space and time but mieke bal goes beyond the phenomenological and explores the way in which viewers bring their own sense of history memory and culture to bear upon the object being viewed experienced for bal in this particular instance it is bernini that haunts the sculptures under scrutiny and her case in convincing the book is short and exquisitely produced in full color 
excellent for those seeking information about these problems i would highly recommend this book to women who suffer from pcos hirsutism obesity infertility menstrual irregularity alopecia or hair loss acne or oily skin anxiety and depression all of these symptoms deal with high testosterone levels and can be dangerous if not treated as mentioned in the book she addresses all the issues except for some herbs which is why i rated this book a instead of clearly androgen disorders are a big problem not being taken seriously by the medical profession and others in the field i suffer almost all of these symptoms and it helped me to realize that something is starting to be done or at least someone like theresa cheung is taking these issues serious the high testosterone which she points out in the book can lead to diabetes hypertention and cancer unless treated i am grateful for the book and the detailed explaination about the endocrine systems and how they play a role in the body one note she mentions saw palmetto in the book as being an herb for body building due to the fact it raises testosterone levels in my research this is not the case ! i have found that saw palmetto can possibly be used to treat androgen disorders which is not even mentioned in the book in my studies i have read that saw palmetto can be used by women who have an excess of androgenic hormones some of the indications for saw palmetto include hirsutism infertility acne amnenorrhea pcos debility and deficiency it helps to stimulate breast growth and to bring on menstruation saw palmetto has demonstrated anabolic antiandrogenic and estrogenic activity theresa cheung addresses western medicine treatment methods quite clearly and there are many options this book answered most all of the questions i had dealing with excess testosterone 
solutions manual the book is excellent is there a solutions manual it would be nice to be able to compare answers 
refreshing i ve taught writing for years and this is one of the best books i ve come across in that time the only reason i didn t give it five stars has nothing to do with the authors a book on writing should be especially well checked for typos and layout errors but this one has more than its fair share still this is a good book and i look forward to using it in my teaching 
the vatican set the stage at the begining of the st century we are witnessing a resurgence of anti semitism this is an appropriate time to read mr kertzers outstanding book in order to understand the terible historical burden the catholic church must carry for the rise of th century anti semitism this is a well researched account proving that the church cannot wash it s hands of the blood of the victims of the shoah the book examines church policy against the jews from the end of the th to the begining of the th centuries kertzers research clearly proves that there cannot be a clear and neat distinction between quotclassicalquot ie religous antisemitism and quotmodernquot ie racial antisemitism racial antisemitism was not a divergence from church antisemitim but developed from it chuch leaders particularly the jesuit press were active in the various circles promoting modern antisemitism the church cannot distance itself from the annihilation of european jewry it s very doctrine set the stage present day islamist fundamentalists promoting anti semitism would particularly do well to read this book 
karen rose does it again i have read all of the karen rose books and i continue to love every one of them the other reviews go into great depth explaining the plot so i won t the best review i can give an author is when i can honestly say i can t put it down when i fall asleep at work due to reading all night i can tell you it was a karen rose book nothing to fear did not diappoint me yet thrilled me with more suspense and visual images than most of karens books i honestly can say that i wish she wrote times faster so i wouldn t have to wait so long for another book to get published when i meet a friend or stranger reading romance i can t help but recommend a karen rose book this is my latest favorite of hers keep writing karen !

church why bother i thought it was well written and thought provoking attending church and bible study have become an important part of my daily life i really enjoy philip yancy s writing style and think he has a good sense of what are the important issues that are facing christians today in our society 
a spanish teacher loves this book since i m not a native speaker i had my class concentrate more on learning to read and translate spanish they pretty much liked this book they were more interested in the stories about the two high school students maria and enrique than the history of the spanish conquest or the story of lazarillo de tormes the sections are short and accompanied by sets of questions to be answered as well as true false questions and even crossword puzzles this book is very easy to read the author uses mostly present tense and lots of cognates my students were mostly nd year repeats and they were able to get through it 
a desert thriller i loved the descriptions of the west texas terrain and the tough character of anna pidgeon in this unusual mystery anna a park ranger who escaped nyc after the death of her husband discovers quotaccidentsquot are happening a little too frequently at guadeloupe mountains national park the descriptions of her and her fellow nps employees is fascinating i also loved the relationship she has with her psychiatrist sister whom she frequently calls back in nyc the end scene is terrific as the killer is unveiled and anna struggles to save her own life in the middle of nowhere and i loved the way anna serves justice in the end 
gabaldan redeemed herself with this book after reading the firery cross i was skeptical when i started this one i thought that it might not be up to her usual standards like the th book firery cross ms galbaldon is back to her exceptional standards if you were disappointed by the th book don t let that discourage you from getting this one i enjoyed this one very much and look forward to reading her forth coming books 
i kill with my heart i do not aim with my hand he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father i aim with my eye i do not shoot with my hand he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father i shoot with my mind i do not kill with my hand he who kills with his hand has forgotten the face of his father i kill with my heart the major thing i don t understand is why in every version of the cover art blane is depicted as an old west style train when he s a ultramodern monorail in the book five star writing quality but i have to take something off for the incongruity of the artwork 
fantastic again this book is cracking just like the skinner i thoroughly enjoyed it took days to read and that was only because of work food and sleep breaks dragon and ian cormac are back and this makes for some real fun there s big bigger and biggest nasties roaming around a good splattering and i use that word with a chuckle of violent death a decent amount of sci fi and a damn good story to boot the last book i read of his was cowl and it didn t feel quite like neal was enjoying himself writing it this one is different mind if i wrote stuff like this i d enjoy it too one small note if your a first time asher buyer i d suggest picking up line of polity first its not absolutely needed but it d certainly give you a good grounding 
an informative entertaining read what a monumental task telling the story of such a remarkable complex literary figure valerie boyd does an outstanding job of revealing hurston s motivations inspiration and personal character i ve always loved hurston as a writer reading this biography fortified my respect for her talent and sheer will to create this book provides a spiritual lift znh is solid evidence that creativity cannot be suppressed additionally the book is a virtual tour of the harlem renaissance and some its most illustrious players and a thoughtful chronicle of the black experience in the early th century a must read for students of african american history and culture 
great book great format inspiring down toearth examples i enjoyed the short stories in this book each one highlighting a businessperson overcoming amazing challenges to become successful or if they were already successful when crisis hit what they did to remain that way the wide range of professionals presented also shows that the determination and vision of one person can truly make all the difference albeit sometimes painfully irrespective of service or industry 
fantastic this is a unique read not a novel but equally engrossing not a historical account but namedrops events from history which most readers will probably be unaware of my first philosophical read but not intimidatingly so ! chapters are split into themes such as quothow respect has become more desirable than power quot quotwhy there has been more progress in cooking than in sex quot and so on it was the index which made me buy this book oddly enough quotcaesar cairo cardano calcuta calvin john camerada cancer quot any book which includes such a diverse range of topics has to teach you many things i m jealous of the author and have bought this book for friends and would recommend it to anyone

the navajo landscape tony hillerman once again takes us into the world of the navajo with jim chee and the legendary joe leaphorn of the navajo tribal police i read this for the first time some years ago and this entry in the long running series is very exciting it has a lot of atmosphere and leaphorn and chee are fleshed out more than usual in this terrific read both chee and leaphorn are dealing with personal issues as this one begins chee hasn t quite figured out how he feels about mary leaving him because he could not leave his navajo way of life behind and move to the city with her he is smitten with a pretty navajo attorney named janet but she s with someone else leaphorn meanwhile is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife emma niether he or chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named eleanor friedman bernal no navajo would be involved as stealing pots like this would make one a thief of time according to navajo tradition chees letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to leaphorn s investigation and once more chee will be helping leaphorn all across the navajo territory this one will stretch all the way into utah and down the san juan river leaphorn will be reminded of a young boy s death by drowning before this one wraps up and it will have unexpected ties to his search for eleanor it seems eleanor was looking for pots made by the anasazi a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth pictographs and petroglyphs of kokopelli the watersprinkler will play a vital part in this mystery but eleanor s interest is also anthropological and someone thinks what she s discovered is worth killing for leaphorn and chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery one will have to race to the other as things turn ugly and two very different men will find commom ground when leaphorn asks the unexpected of young chee hillermans descriptions of the thousand foot cliffs along the san juan river at night under a sky filled with navajo mystery will enthrall you this is a good mystery and quite possibly the best in the series you don t want to miss this one 
musings on a broken spined hardcover my copy is nearing yrs old and shows the wear and tear of living in backpacks suitcases briefcases and brown paper bags this compendium of different books of service s work will take you from his gold rush days of the yukon to his escape to the bohemian quarter in paris to become a serious poet and to his volunteering to become an ambulance driver for the red cross in the first world war his ballads are remarkable in how they take you deeply into the the person s life for that brief time as you read there is the lighthearted comedy he is known for with quotthe cremation of sam mcgee quot as well as the first person accounts of the unimaginable horrors and uplifting glories of battle in the trenches service wrote for the everyday working man in everything he is utterly approachable and unpretentious i will confess as does he this is quotlowbrow stuff quot but it is mighty satisfying 
a genuine classic what can we say a genuine classic now available with every footnote and factoid known to every woman and man 
excellent unbiased well written piece of journalism and entertainment my favorite chapter of this book was branding the babies that provided an historical summary of the methods and initiatives by the us congress the reagan and clinton administrations to solve the illegal immigration issue the writing style of this book is fluent easy to read no political agenda just good unbiased yet entertaining journalism roberto suro is brilliant with the english language and provides inside glimpses into the latino community including the gangs 
fantastic this has to be something to add to your collection if and only if you are truly an advanced player the average player needs to grow a bit before all of the gems in this book can be revealed a new player should buy the book put in on their shelf and plan to read it as part of the next set of books to read and and after they ve picked up the subtleties of the game 
excellent enjoyed reading the book couldn t put it down very intense i am now reading wizard and glass which is almost finished 
how christianity changed the world this book exposes the truth behind the institutions of compassion and education that secularism has conveniently eliminated from the pages of history knowing these truths opens ones eyes to the reality of true christianity in our world a must read for truth seekers

from bad cook to good cook i was possibly one of the worst cooks on the planet until i discovered giada de laurentiis and bought giadas family dinners book it truly inspired me to enjoy not only the cooking but also the preparation of the food it s georgously glossy with lots of lovely photos and the recipes are so simple to follow that i have so far failed to produce a disastrous result which in itself is a small miracle all of the ingredients used are easily available the suggested menus are also a great idea especially for someone who needs all the help i can get one of my favourite recipes is the lasagna rolls and whoever heard of grilling lettuce but it works ! i would also recommend giada s everyday italian book for all the same reasons plus the fact that the vodka sauce is heavenly thank you giada i m no longer scared of the kitchen 
a fantastic book to introduce your child to art i can t tell you how wonderful this book is for me and my two andahalf year old daughter it is such a delight to curl up in bed and turn the pages as she gleefully points out the item that starts with the letter a b c and so on we ve only read it a handful of times but she s already gotten each picture and letter memorized it makes me so happy to be able to introduce her to fine art at such a young age and for her to find so much enjoyment from it this is truly a gem of book for every parent child s bookshelf 
a house divided the shame of the nation the restoration of apartheid schooling in america will challenge any illusion the reader holds that america has left her divided and racist history far behind truly a heart rending account of apartheid schooling that bridges the larger social implications of racial and economic disparity with the daily life and dreams of our children 
judgement in death the audio was fast moving had some twists and turns kept you guess who the murderer was enjoyed the book tape tremendousl 
excellent introduction to quotmacumbaquot bramly s book is probably the best account by an outsider of quotmacumbaquot a generic and often pejorative term for afro brazilian religions such as umbanda and candomble the only unfortunate thing about the book is the title ! another great source of information about quotmacumbaquot is the music book quotthe brazilian sound quot which goes into great detail about the history of candomble in brazil and its link to samba and afoxe music 
the art of historical fiction faced with a long and dreary winter empire may be just the antidote gore vidal s epic makes for educational if sometimes tedious fireside reading empire is a tough one to plow through in one sitting let alone one month but in the end it rewards the reader with an informative narration of turn ofthecentury america the fourth in vidal s five part series empire features both historical and fictitious characters who share the plot in equal dollops throughout the novel a cursory knowledge of early th century american history mckinley roosevelt hay etc enhances the reading experience but even without this knowledge the book is well worth the read the closing dialogue alone justifies the effort 
a book that is likely to send a sharp chill up through the spines of its target audience this book was a required reading during my first year of high school in a course called humanities and i thought it was a pretty interesting but very scary read i must warn you if you dislike violence or are adverse to killing in any shape or form then don t even think i repeat don t even think about considering this novel as it is filled with intense violence and there are definitely some killings most of this violence is done by a character called okonkwo who in a desperate attempt to cover up any sign of weakness will resort to extremely brutal measures such as literally pounding with his fist or slaughtering with some huge weapon anyone unfortunate enough to anger him especially his children you see this okonkwo is a big fella about weighing approximately lbs and he is also the championship wrestler of his village so you know a beating from this dude is gonna hurt he is also a warlike fellow who treats cowardice like a disease the only cure of which is an extremely severe beating as his children often experience if you so much as cry or act in a timid or sensitive manner then you can expect to feel the wrath of okonkwo that is a severely intense beating that is akin to having a giant boulder fall right on top of you it is some pretty intense stuff and okonkwo is definitely mr no play and that is what makes this book so chilling yet so compelling and captivating all at the same time 
good use of chinese and soviet archives this book is an example of how the end of the cold war has helped american history be less quotamericancentricquot we think one thing but along comes chinese and soviet sources that help us have a more balanced view of the past the book traces the relationship between the u s u ssr and china from it is well researched and well argued and for the most part balanced i felt there could have been a little clearer discussion of what lead up to the nixon visit to china in it still seemed to just happen a must for those interested in the cold war china and soviet communism and the such 
wonderful ! excellent ! i can use it in many ways this is the one excellent ideas simple to use a variety of styles to present stories and activities it really works for ages and older ones can enjoy it also thanks 
if liberals talk about the author instead of the book the book must be true 
it shall be done this book is a must read for businessmen educators coaches and anyone who feels like they are in need of a lift ! the parable in this book is a great motivator in today s world where most everyone is trying to find the easy way out and pass the buck this book teaches you to be on the lookout for what may seem like a dubious task but in actuality is a quotblue vase quot test ! i read this book in about two hours easy reading ! should be required in all schools 
scholarly presentation this book is loaded with info on various early artifacts but is mainly for those involved in field work and academia i wish i had looked a little more closely before buying it what i really wanted was a pictorial reference with plenty of colored photos the writing is highly detailed as you would expect for a scholarly reference there are line drawings and b w photos but no color plates most helpful for professionals involved in the excavation process and for museum curators etc however those interested in a general mostly pictorial guide to early colonial artifacts should look elsewhere

a life changer like many other reviewers i am rating this book as high as i can because it actually changed my life it gave me a new way of looking at money things shopping ego status and time it is not a budget book it is an attitude changing book because of this particular book combined with much thought i decided to retire early and work part time to live very modestly and within my means most of the time and to quit wanting more stuff my day is now my own every day is a holiday if i want it to be and i don t even know when the work week begins this one is a must read 
a brilliant book shuman s book is path breaking leading the reader step by step far into what is possible for local economics it places power firmly in each of our hands and it points the way forward through wise and well researched strategies that promise to truly make a significant difference it is a living example of how to be an effective change agent showing how to embark on these efforts in such friendly spiritedness that folks can hardly but be drawn in one can barely get to the end without wanting to leap into action vibrant community healthy societies and restored ecosystems await if we heed his urgent and wise prescriptions 
one of my favorite top books the title says it all i often compare this book to the alchemist but life of pi has far more humor to it 
intriguing and perplexing in equal measure i very much enjoyed reading this book it is a biographical account of one mans experience as he moves from a position of ignorance towards an understanding of zen the bewildering spritual how to which seems to have a lot more to do with what you don t do than what you do the confounding realisation that all effort is false whereas no effort can lead to superhuman feats of accuracy it s a magical true story about how a mans confusion and understanding become fused into something of an incomprehensible truth you don t understand it but it works what i enjoyed most about the text is that it gives insipration to zen learners something to aim for so to speak what i didn t like is that it doesn t really offer insight into how one combines an attitude of no presumed effort with the experience of splitting an arrow shaft lengthwise from the far side of an unlit warehouse in other words the book sufficiently illustrates the effects of success with zen practice but having read the book the cause still remains a mystery a relaxed attitude alone will do nothing to improve your golfing average so how does it work 
so so so funny underdog humor mean and loving at once how does he do it there is much love in his writing even when his characters are disdaining others there is love it s refreshing that a writer who has such a sharp merciless eye could also be so loving towards his subjects it s quite a feat most people do one or the other but not both at the same time 
charming audio but probably better in text i recently heard the audio book for this title the story was pleasant enough even charming if you will you can see the publishing information on the story itself my biggest complaint about the audio book was that the voice actress didn t make the characters seem very appealing she was a good actress to be sure but taylor came off as a quivering ninny and lucas though admitedly a mountain man character came off sounding like a stupid hick i applaud the actress s deft handling of the accents but it made the characters seem very annoying not a bad piece but it could have been better

the title says it all claudia bloom is a vibrant imperfect funny and unpredictable woman who lands in a strange world and tries desperately to fit in all while coping with turning and what that means when you call yourself a tart i cheered and cried and could not put it down don t let the fact it is published by a romance imprint dissuade you from buying this book jody gehrman is an excellent writer with a knack for bringing the details of a moment into cinematic clarity her characters are strong and memorable highly recommended

a generation spanning favorite i discovered drummer hoff in a scholastic book offer at school when i was six and begged my parents to buy it for me like many little boys i was enamored by soldiers and would pour over the book again and again entranced by the colorful european dress uniforms worn by the motley bunch of soldiers who were assembling loading and preparing to fire a cannon each one was distinctive and i was particularly fond of sergeant chowder who brought the powder a gruff looking peg legged fellow in a grenadiers hat and captain bammer who brought the rammer a swashbuckling eye patch wearing chap all of the illustrations were stunningly lined wood cuts brightly colored i would try to draw soldiers who looked like those in the book and learned all the words by heart jump forward thirty years my first child was born and though i hadn t looked at the book in over twenty five years i found myself chanting the words to my baby as i rocked him to sleep i still remembered them perfectly ! i retrieved drummer hoff from my parent s attic and it has now become my two pre school boy s favorite book it is a cherished piece of my childhood that i am thrilled to be able to pass on to them other reviews here have mentioned the subtle anti war message contained in this book and i must agree when the cannon fires it is a two page spread kahbahblooom all done in hellish red with some dark purple and blue behind it when you turn the next page all of the sharply dressed parade ground soldiers are gone and the abandoned cannon that was their focus has become a dilapidated ruin in an overgrown meadow full of birds and butterflies though as a child i could not clearly articulate the thoughts i remember pondering what happened to the soldiers why they had left the cannon there and if they had perhaps been hurt when it was fired it was my first influence to suggest that war might be something other than romance and adventure my young boys have already questioned me about these very things which they too noticed it is a fine age appropriate way to begin to instill the values of peace in the hearts of little boys among all of the many wonderful books written for small children this was is and ever shall be my very favorite it receives my highest recommendation theo logos 
historically exciting intriquing and romantic i ve read reviews regarding the follow up to princess of fire knight of fire and was disappointed to find that many readers considered knight of fire boring and unexciting however princess of fire opens with a fierce battle later called the battle of hastings and the inevitable capture of the king s daughter princess fallon hence begins the attempt to bend or break the strong willed courageous princess however sparks flew between the then lady fallon and count alaric long before the battle of hastings shannon drake heather graham remains true to her nature in capturing your attention with an exciting and gut wrenching opening and then later leads you through a someone mediocre history of the hero and heroine s entwined lives that eventually catapults at the battle of hastings the heroine is considered to be so courageous and determined to avenge her father s death rid her beloved country of the invading normans and restore the crown to an english head that she is actually considered a serious threat to william the conqueror but alas in the end england is ruled by the norman conqueror and the princess is ruled by the conqueror of her heart in all i ve rated this particular shannon drake novel a four star particularly since this is one shannon drake novel that i would actually purchase especially after being disppointed with other drake novels 
good practical advice when i began this book i found it elementary having worked with a coach for years and done a great deal of work in the area of personal development as i continued reading i began to quotget it quot the concept is that we all have the power to achieve our goals simplier than pursuing by attracting well worth the purchase for students of coaching and any one who wants to attain more with less effort

a good man s long journey john tyree is a soldier first a man second or so he thinks until he meets savannah lynn curtis while on leave he falls desperately in love with savannah the proverbial girl of his dreams sweet intelligent and giving john knows he ll always carry her torch when september changes the world john is no exception moved by patriotic loyalty he chooses to reup in the army adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to savannah more promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father this is the story of how an ideal love can falter despite its purity and strength not every romance results in a happy ending but with a great deal of luck those who don t survive will find meaning from the experience love loyalty friendship all those sentiments are great but to what cost and how does this make a good man great this is john s journey to that understanding it goes without saying that nicholas sparks is one of today s master storytellers part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists such is the case in dear john sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components wellcrafted setting high emotion obstacles resolution then breaks it it is from the sadness that hope emerges and john tyree although still quite young gains wisdom that will last a lifetime sorrow will be a large part of this yes but there is room for something more something that will reach beyond the pages and touch john s tomorrow in a way only he will see while this works there is something lacking it is one of those hard todefine qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding maybe it s the heavy reliance on john s soldiering as an excuse for certain behaviors or perhaps it has more to do with aspects relating to john s relationship with his father who appears to have asperger s syndrome im giving dear john books for a beautiful story but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper reviewed by christina wantz fixemer

a remarkable guide to mental health we all behave in ways that mystify us there are those times when we find ourselves hypercritical and judgmental or profoundly nurturing or consumed with anger far out of proportion to the provocation or able to reason with insight and dispassion from whence come these vastly different responses to the triggers of life born to win provides a vivid and compelling journey through the emotional ego states that are invoked by life events the authors conceptualize these emotional ego states through the hypothetical construct suggested by eric berne m d games people play in the parent state we are judgmental or nurturing in the adult state rational and analytical in the child state impulsive and playful or angry and hurt the authors demonstrate how our emotional responses to life events arise out of these three ego states each ego state has an appropriate time and place often however our inappropriate or self defeating emotional responses occur because we have been overprogrammed by aversive early life events to respond from one ego state when another would be far more adaptive recognizing the inappropriate ego state and making the transition to the more proper ego state vastly improves the quality of one s life eg responding to constructive criticism as a rational adult instead of as a petulant child we are all born to win and can do so when we learn to respond to life events from the proper ego state born to win is an invaluable contribution to the cause of mental health 
very good but don t expect it to be easy i really enjoyed this book i had a hard time with his writing style at first but found it easier as the story went along i felt this was a wonderfully challenging book so much i did not know about the s i would tell anyone to read it and give it a chance by the end of the book you will be flying through the pages however this book took more time for me to read than almost anyother book i have read enjoy 
not for the timid whether you are a man in a position of power authority or a woman who routinely encounters men in power and authority this book should be required reading men using their positions of power and authority to victimize women is a problem of huge proportions some men are predators some men are culpably ignorant of their own individual weaknesses dr rutter attacks this issue of sexual tensions in relationships between men and the women who should be able to trust these men his true stories are very clear and chilling they are chilling because if you are honest you can see yourself in those situations dr rutter has expressed the subtle emotional undercurrents that go on within a man woman work professional relationship better than any other book i have ever read he does not mince words or try to nicely talk around blunt painful and destructive sexual encounters within the quotforbidden zone quot if you want to bury your head in the sand and pretend that these interpersonal sexual dynamics are not there then stay away from this book if you want to deal with reality try to understand yourself and safeguard your professional relationships then read this book

i m a fan kurt vonnegut knows how to draw your attention and it s often only after you ve finished the book that you realize the level of seriousness that he was trying to portray having read slaughterhouse five breakfast of champions and a man without a country i was excited when heard about this one from my friend eric its about a guy writing about the day the bombs were dropped on heroshima and nagasaki he s also telling his story of how he converted to bokononism in real life vonnegut is a notable humanist and the cyncism of man made religion is evident in these pages bokonon is a religious leader who follows a few basic steps to creating a good religion he lives life as an outlaw voluntarily and he admits from the beginning of the books of bokonon that his religion is all lies the plots seems to shallow out a bit in the middle only slightly but by the end you are flying through pages to find the ultimate fate of the wonderful and crazy characters dark humor on par with catch it is difficult to decipher what is meant as farce and what is absurd but overall a highly entertaining read and a very good take on organized religion 
ian myles slater on the way of war and peace as discreetly acknowledged on the back cover this book was originally published in hardcover as the tao of peace that edition published by shambhala clearly identified itself on its cover as a translation of a work by the t ang dynasty general wang chen about c e a product of one of the classical periods of chinese history the westview press version is a little harder to recognize for what it is in both versions it is in fact a translation with an introduction and commentary by the translators of taoteching lun ping yao yishu one of the more unusual of the many surviving chinese commentaries on the tao te ching or laotzu daodejing and laozi in the current pinyin transliteration the sawyers continue to use the familiar wade giles system the character classic as it is also known and as wang chen sometimes cites it was of exceptional importance to the t ang the supposed author was officially an ancestor of the dynasty the chinese roots of which were often questioned the westview edition has been repackaged slightly revised in references to the title and expanded by a section of further reading which is in effect a catalogue of the translators other books on chinese military thought for westview rather than for study of the taoteching for some suggestions see below ralph d sawyer explains in the preface that they have also provided a translation of the taoteching itself which uses wang chen s apparent readings and parsing of the text and so differs from the many earlier translations and from the sawyers own understanding of the book each of the eighty one chapters consists of a passage of the lao tzu wang chen s explanation of its application and the translators explication of its mainly military and political context and significance the two alternative titles of the translation reflect the thrust of wang chen s commentary equally well although the choice seems to reflect the markets served by the two publishers as is the case with many shambhala publications the volume is rather thin on references although sawyer s preface does mention some important translations of the tao te ching since he explains that the book is directed at ordinary readers he might have expanded some of these brief comments in the preface the ordinary reader may not be familiar with say the difference between the ho shang kung and wang pi texts of lao tzu which he mentions in passing these are two early commentaries whose approaches and textual readings mark the religious and philosophical approaches to the book the received wang pi text of lao tzu by the way seems not to correspond completely to the one implied in his commentary ! for relevant bibliography see below wang chen and his commentary are the main focus of the book the sawyers attempt to show how the general connects his views to a book usually treated from religious and philosophical perspectives the question of whether wang chen is correctly interpreting his canonical text is of course of no great concern the commentary is a common form for expressing original ideas in many cultures with strong text based traditions hebrew and sanskrit for example as well as chinese this commentary is an attempt to find a consistent basis for humane and effective government it was intended to replace the t ang tendency for random shifting between ruthless interventionism and quietist failure to govern whether this instability in policy was a cause of the dynasty s difficulties or a dangerous symptom is another matter having a contemporary analysis of the dynasty s problems is only part of the book s considerable interest the secondary literature on the taoist classic is very large and the number of translations continues to grow the sawyers work offers an unexpected reading and does not require a wider knowledge of the base text to be appreciated on its own terms those seriously interested in the textual problems of the taoteching can now consult the recent technical edition and translation by rudolf g wagner a chinese reading of the daodejing wang bi s commentary on the laozi with critical text and translation together with wagner s the craft of a chinese commentator wang bi on the laozi and language ontology and political philosophy in china wang bi s scholarly exploration of the dark xuanxue it was published in the state university of new york suny press chinese philosophy and culture series they are significantly more difficult than the tao of war or almost any of the readily available translations of lao tzusuny had also published alan k l chan s two visions of the way a study of the wang pi and the ho shang kung commentaries on the lao tzu in its older series in chinese philosophy which although slightly antiquated offers a fascinating comparison of two of the earliest of the competing philosophical political and religious interpretations to which wang chen was adding 
excellent account and audio read this review refers to in the heart of the sea by nathaniel philbrick unabridged audio edition read by scott bricknathaniel philbrick leaves no stone unturned in this very tragic and complex but true account of the wreck and sinking of the whaleship essex rammed by a huge sperm whale that from all accounts was a definite attack on the ship the crew men who lived and profited by the sea and were the slayers of whales for the precious oil provided were now the victims as the hunted became the hunter it is an incredible story of man s will to survive against all odds that was the inspiration for melville s moby dick philbrick immediately draws you into not only the lives of the essex s crew members but the entire town of nantucket from where the ship sailed detailing the close kint families the women s roles and the daily life in nantucket often revealing some very intimate details the life on board a whaling ship the hardships of the journey for both the crew and their families and the journey itself through the vast ocean are all very much a part of this story you will feel like you have gone back in time to and are there with them as the whale attacks the ship the men nearly frozen by horror and disbelief and the beginning of a long horrifying journey a fight to stay alive under some of the worst conditions imaginable for thousands of miles and many months i was constantly amazed at their ingenuity and stamina as they tried to find safety food and water steering clear of islands they thought might be inhabited by cannibals they later found they had to resort to that themselves questions still remain as to the actual circumstances that occurred a handful of survivors left to tell the story not all agreeing on some points but enough so that this tragedy at sea and the men who lost their lives as well as those that survived may be remembered for their bravery philbrick delves into all the details from the people involved to procedures at sea and even what became of the survivors through the years the book is so well written that it will grab you right away and won t let you go sometimes you have to keep in mind that this amazing tale is not an adventure novel the reading of this audio book is excellent as well scott brick sets the tone and captures the importance the tragic events and the emotions involved this unabridged edition has two sided tapes each one running about an hour and a half most of the second side of tape and all of tape is devoted to notes journals and resources which i found to be quite a big help in pointing out other books i may be interested in reading more about i found the sound quality of this edition to be very good with an occasional voice heard in the background not sure if it was an echo or someone else speaking that in no way interfered with the reading sometimes the reviews for all editions of a book are lumped together on the product page if you are interested in this audio edition the isbn or asin listed on the product details is a book that will certainly get read again and again highly recommended read for anyone but for those who love tales of the sea an excellent account of a tragic story

long but worth it first of all this is the longest book i ve ever read cover to cover the last page of text is numbered i read this out of interest in the subject and not because i was taking a class although i read over a dozen books leading up to this one this book was well worth the preparation time and the time it took to actually read it this book provides thorough coverage of the topic of cellular biology and from what i can tell it may well be the definitive book on the subject i have a masters degree in computer science and i ve read many books on bioinformatics and related topics and the one thing i ve come to appreciate is the almost overwhelming complexity of biological systems and the ominous task of investigating them the length of this book is an absolute necessity and the cd which comes along with the book provides even more highly necessary information the creation of this book was an enormous service to all of us interested in cellular biology and the compilation of all this information into a single highly comprehensible volume was an amazing feat

wodehouse at his best this is a great funny book it may be my favorite jeeves wooster story 
nice introduction to jefferson jefferson is of course an icon of our founding this book sketches his life from birth to death focusing on those aspects that pertain to establishing the nation s political identity also despite its brevity the ambiguities of jefferson are not ignored jefferson was a slave owning aristocrat yet he championed liberty for all people at least in theory however jefferson could not bridge the racial divide and he was hardly an advocate of any significant democratization of social and political affairs his relationship or lack thereof with sally hennings a household slave of jefferson s is mentioned several times too often actually with no hard conclusions drawn if a brief yet somewhat comprehensive biography of jefferson was needed this book is a fine contribution what is obvious is that jefferson and others constructed a basic raw framework for a nation and its government but in jefferson s lifetime alone the operation and even the distribution of power within government was an evolving process in addition much to jefferson s dismay american life was beginning to change from being mostly an agrarian society of small producers it would be interesting to see a jeffersonian scholar speculate as to the possibility of jefferson understanding and accepting the vast changes in american society over the last two hundred years would the vast private power of corporations in an industrial society be of concern what would he prescribe to countervail that power would he have accepted gender and racial equality one has to wonder about the legitimacy of directly invoking jefferson to support positions on either the right or the left in today s complex society jefferson like anyone else was a man of his times constructing ideas and dealing with issues in that context what is really interesting is that jefferson strongly suggested that the constitution be rewritten every nineteen years he seems to have known what we do not that documents written to govern the affairs of men are not so sacred as to be untouchable it makes the strict constructionists of our era appear to be silly in reading this book it is obvious that this nation has benefited greatly from a group of very insightful men from the eighteenth century one would hope that similar wisdom can find a voice in a world where ideas have to compete with sophisticated public relations and propaganda of many forms

great introduction this little number is great for an individual who has little knowledge of judaism displays in a readable way the differences between christianity and it s parent faith judaism great read for anyone wishing an introduction into a very misunderstood faith especially looking on from an outsider 
a rational and a voice with clarity we see a lot of violence on a daily basis all we need to do is tune in to the news most of this violence is by extremist groups groups especially associated with religions followed closely by ethnicity there is a lot of reconciling that needs to be done between the official projection of these religions by our respective and respectful governments as peaceful and the apparent violence with which these terrorist acts are inflicted on the general public by these religious groups the solutions to these problems are neither simplistic nor easy as our governments in all their simplemindedness assume it seems they are clueless at times sen who resides in a land not of his ancestors must be acutely aware of the role of identity in shaping individuals and their allegiances and as an economist he knows the choices that people take through out a typical day even while not aware of the constraints in which they are operating an ideal confluence which benefits the reader s anxiousness for understanding the proposal that individuals have different identities act and shaped by them is fairly easy to convince because in retrospect it seems obvious although a lot of us don t know what we are missing it does seem like he belabors this point repeatedly but that isn t tedious and is excusable sens proposals as to how the governments specifically the british can deal with ethnic and religious hot potato issues are worth taking a look at it seems like some govts are doing the exact opposite of what needs to be done hence inadvertently exacerbating the issues we get a revealing sense into how people tick and sometimes are ticked off those lessons can be used in finding solutions to our own problems in which ever part on this earth we are to me this looks like a global epidemic and rarely do seemingly disparate problems have a common method as solutions my disappointment with this book is that sen doesn t go too deeply into some issues he mentions in passing however that might be of relief to people only interested in the overarching phenomenon and not for example interested too much about british policies 
the best little people book oh my gosh ! this book is so wonderful i read it as a kid and i have it completely memorized it from cover to cover it sounds even better when you say it from memory to people they are like whoa ! i am going to buy it for my kids 
the twilight of an empire ends with the thunder of guns focusing on just two climactic years frederic morton recreates vienna in all its splendor during the last days of the austro hungarian empire the vibrant social intellectual and cultural life of vienna is examined within the context of the seething nationalism of the balkans the machiavellian intrigue among the political rulers of the european nations and russia and the human frailties of the seemingly larger thanlife national leaders which assure that the twilight of the empire will eventually be overtaken by darkness rigorously selective in his choice of detail morton brings to life the varied activities of a broad cross section of viennese society and reproduces the intellectual milieu which eventually leads to the rise of some of the most influential leaders of the twentieth century trotsky stalin adler freud jung lenin hitler tito and a host of others all of whom are part of vienna life mortons seriousness of purpose and his scholarship are undeniable yet his primary contribution here it seems to me is his ability to make historical personages come to life to make the reader feel that they were real breathing humans with both virtues and frailties and not the cardboard characters one finds so often in history books vienna as we see it here has a real heart albeit one that beats in time from the masquerades and balls held by all classes of society to the revolutionary movements innumerable newspapers and pamphlets lively coffee houses and seemingly endless games of political maneuvering one feels the ferment and activity which must lead eventually to change the liveliness of the city as depicted here is a visual and intellectual contrast to the formality and frailty of emperor franz josef making the twilight of his empire understandable and its demise inevitable even the empire s demise is stylish however according to morton as the world war came to the city by the danube it came dressed as a ball tra lahurrah mary whipple 
great resource for the classroom unlike schindler s list in divided lives a book by cynthia crane the reader is able to put a face with a name and learn about personal experiences before during and after the war no longer are these people just statistics but they are actual people who had a life that was turned upside down by the holocaust divided lives is the type of resource that could be used in schools especially high school to show the truth about what holocaust victims went through day after day and the effects it had on the rest of their lives divided lives not only shows students about the uniqueness of this period in history but children can also connect on an emotional level and learn an appreciation for their own lives and the human race

a romp through food taboos this book is an informal exploration of food taboos from apples to potatoes pig flesh to human flesh the book is organized into chapters featuring the seven deadly sins lust gluttony pride sloth greed blasphemy and anger each chapter is comprised of short informative articles related to the relevant sinful theme that describe the social history of a food taboo for example in the chapter called lust we learn how the apple came to be associated with eve s forbidden fruit in the garden of eden allen points out that apples were hardly common middle eastern fruit during biblical times they were however sacred to the celts and when christians came into celtic territory they demonized the sacred fruit of the celts by translating the biblical word for the forbidden fruit one whose botanical identify is not known for sure as apple allen states the celts had associated apples with the glorious wisdom from the sun by the time the christians were done scholars had assigned it to the jurisdiction of venus and lust each chapter also includes several recipes featuring the foods under description some of the recipes are historical rather than in contemporary usage but virtual all have been updated for modern kitchens and cooks sources are cited in extensive textual endnotes there is also a bibliography and index taboos of all kinds are often closely related with religious beliefs allen describes some common religious taboos relating to food such as jewish and muslim avoidance of pork and hindu extreme reverence for cattle one interesting point that allen makes is that christ was blatant in his practice of disregarding jewish food laws establishing a religion that is remarkably free of food taboos allen pokes fun at our modern diet practices but he also makes some serious points noting that convenience foods are so unpleasant they make even work look good they re also immensely profitable for the corporations who produce them american workers now pay more money for worse food so they can hurry back to jobs they hate in his conclusion allen observes the point is that these archaic food taboos and rules however preposterous and evil they may have at times been also deepened our lives by imbuing our most common social gathering with meaning occasionally allen plays fast and loose with details for example he has european peasants munching macintoshes but the macintosh variety of apples was developed only in in new england he also misses some major taboos of course in a book of this nature we can t expect him to cover everything related to the topic but when he describes garlic and religious injunctions against it he never mentions avoidance by some hindus of garlic and onions on the grounds that they are intoxicating or overstimulating such an omission is surprising given the other information he provides both about indian traditions and garlic allen s style of writing is informal he writes to entertain as well as inform making the book appeal to general readers rather than academic food historians since this is a book about breaking taboos readers shouldn t be too taken aback at the kinds of topics allen choose to delve into but they might not want to consider this a read aloud book for the whole family if small children are to participate

no better time to get your ahimsa and satyagraha this is a book that should and will profoundly affect you on the one hand its wonderful and inspiring but i find myself instead feeling heart broken mournful i grieve for an alternate reality where our leaders have either the education curiosity wisdom or courage to embrace the lessons of great people such as gandhi it s not exactly esoteric stuff everyone knows the name gandhi and has at least some sense of where he stands historically even for the non readers there was the movie it was a big deal gandhis true transformation occurred when he realized that violence is demeaning not just to victims but to the perpetrators it is an intoxicating release of sadistic impulses impulses that are addicting and toxic i was reading this book and think about the state of the world and found myself thinking the tired clich give peace a chance it feels so trite a well worn sixties throw back but it also a courageous sentiment peace takes courage and creativity and it isn t as quick and easy as violence in the short term but it is more than just a dream peace is a bold assertion what kinds of things crossed my mind when i was reading this book when john kerry returned from vietnam and testified about atrocities being committed by both sides he was vilified by the right wing portrayed as a traitor but it was an act of courage he obviously wasn t saying we should stop the war because american soldiers are bad people he was showing how violence leads to more violence how the violence of an unjust war corrupted the souls of good young americans who were drawn into warfare violence leads to violence but most importantly the converse is also true non violence is just as contagious we see peace leading to peace on all levels from the macro international level all the way down to individual relationships another example that crossed my mind is the all torecent transformation in the culture of inpatient psychiatry in the past restraining people was considered a good treatment option because it quickly stopped dangerous behavior and gave staff a sense of control and safety but now the attitude has changed restraints are no longer seen as a treatment option but instead as a treatment failure a last ditch resort for extreme cases only and the results people are actually safer violent patient behavior eventually goes down when staff thinks creatively of non traumatic solutions those are some of the things that crossed my mind as i read this book something else i like about gandhi as reflected in his writings whether or not you believe he was born destined for greatness has to do with your spiritual bent but either way he accomplished what he accomplished as a political leader and philosopher through the hard work of personal journey and spiritual exploration he was an anglophile when he was young buying into the classism of the oppressors when he became radicalized after witnessing the cruelty and the glee with which the british soldiers repressed rebellion the pendulum at first swung all the way the other way he became a separatist not unlike malcolm x prior to his spiritual transformation in fact gandhi was almost a middle aged man before coming up with the magnanimous observation that violence degrades all involved victims and perpetrators alike that was a surprise to me actually that gandhi rejected separatism at an older age than malcolm x did so read gandhi read share your books talk about what it stirs up dream of a better way and find a way to act on your dreams and read john stuart mill emma goldman malcolm x martin luther king jr edward said chomsky agree disagree but read with an open mind sorry for all the chatter thank you for listening bye bye 
essential reading for law enforcement this book depicts a geniune need in law enforcement the need to hire train and maintain ethical personnel is explained and stressed to the reader in a way that has been overdue the occupation of a law enforcement offical world wide has a real need to be a true character role model or the public offical that can be trusted edwin has a clear style of writing with a no nonsense approach to describe past present and future occurrences of police conduct i believe the criminal justice system would beam with pride and public trust if law enforcement would read and act on the issues and suggestion that delattre brings forth in this fine book 
the single greatest example modern theatre guare s quothouse of blue leaves quot is by far the most memorable well written and exceptionally challenging play that i ve yet to come across granted the only production i ve seen was an amateur presentation at a local performing arts center but that aside the content of guare s play completely overshadowed any lackluster performances as for the philosophy employed in so many recent films magnolia being john malkovich regarding self affirmation through the powers of universal forces quothouse of blue leaves quot exemplifies this modernist philosophy through and through although quotsix degrees of separation quot is the more regarded of guare s plays hobl is the most exceptionally subtle and quietly subversive very very impressive work 
required reading for every president this should be on the coffee table magazine rack bookshelf and waiting room of every serious national leader conscientious voters should also read this in order to understand what it takes to make political peace in the world but stassen is not merely political he s actually biblical first of all he exegetes like a biblical scholar while making applications which only a leading christian ethicist like he could just peacemaking shows that quotjust war theory quot can lead to peace while restraining war and that passifism is an extremely active practice excellent 
this book is just what i needed i ve seen some bad reviews of this book but those people must not have needed it as badly as i did i found this book after working through my chronic yeast infection for a year the authors make it relatively easy to start eliminating problem foods from your diet working your way through the process as far as needed i happen to be one of the bad cases i can t even eat everything on the strictest level the recipes are real things that somebody with problems could eat almost all the recipes are uncomplicated only a few being detailed many very easy and straightforward many could be considered fast food if you have a crockpot or can handle leftovers remade many recipes help you understand how much of certain fresh herbs to use too this book is valuable for those who are serious about this topic i appreciate it very much

deja vu all over again rising tiderising tide the great mississippi flood of and how it changed america by john m barryjohn barry s stellar history of the forgotten events of has remarkable parallels withthe louisiana of today especially given that a bipartisan committee of congress has called for the dismantling of fema because of its egregious failures in responding to katrina the flood itself began innocuously enough in the spring of when it rained for weeks in the midwest and south the mississippi itself grew fat and swollen he writes tens of thousands of acres went under water the gauges measuring depth continued to rise but no one at the weather bureau there was no national weather service or noaa at the time forwarded the information to washington the catalogue of errors and omissions by the bureaucracy runs to chapters of neglect and racism with black laborers conscripted in new orleans to fill sandbags after the levees broke the recovery from the great flood was just as disastrous as people returned to their homes and businesses the strain only intensified the cleanup seemed endless and hopeless mud was caked everywhere four to eight inches of alluvial deposits that had created the delta it gave off a thick fetid smell a smell like dung mixed with swamp gas people said the victims should have gotten out of the city sooner does this sound familiar yet the city became an armed camp blacks and whites who lived in the city had firearms on the levee backs had shovels and hoes and knives with in reach in both races fear grew it was a deep fear rising tide p compounding all of this was a lack of accurate information rumors mixed communications political corruption and profiteering the only federal response came too little and too late the ku klux klan then a fraternal organization to which respectable white men but not jews or irish belonged controlled statehouses and legislatures by the early s at least million americans belonged to the invisible empire some estimates ran as high as eight million rising tide p as with katrina the issues of race run throughout the story the treatment of black refugees revealed an ugly truth the white businessmen who ran the state of mississippi were more concerned with money than with human life and a bitter fight began between member of leroy percy s family over whether to evacuate the black refugees stranded in the delta or keep them as a work force economic interests prevailed once the waters receded it was time to return to normalcy the bankers lawyers and politicians of new orleans began an aggressive marketing campaign to convince visitors that the crescent city was safe to return to they threatened to withhold loans from businesses which failed to comply with official policies newspapers were encouraged to write favorable stories about the city s revival even if the facts didn t support them rising tide is a remarkable account of the manner in which public policy and perceptions were redefined after the great flood 
a good place to start i had the chance to work under dr michael charney for years before his death dr charney focused heavily on education and teaching people that is what this book does when this book came out he gave me a hard time for buying a copy because it was a quotkids book quot all of that aside the book gives a basic introduction to forensic anthropology on a level that explains it to the reader it covers the case from start to finish as well as touching on the other aspects of forensic investigation such as forensic entomology and facial reconstruction so if you have a child that is wanting to learn more about the field or you are looking for a good place to start learning this is the book to get 
highly recommended i loved blunt s first book and was extremely happy to note that this second one is even better he paints a brooding uncomfortable picture of a canadian town but contrast the gruesome storyline with very human and at times gentle lead characters

the tragic history of god s people in this magisterial work johnson chronicles the long and bitter path of the jewish people from the time of abraham a thorough and exhaustive work it explores amongst other things monotheism the concept of the sanctity of life the israelite prophets the birth of christianity the enlightenment the holocaust and the establishment of modern israel the narrative is compelling on many levels as a work of general history as a tome of metaphysical and philosophical thought and in its discussions of historic personalities the seven chapters are israelites judaism cathedocracy ghetto emancipation holocaust and zion the scope of history of the jews is too vast and its insights too edifying to be summarized in a short review to do it justice it needs a review the size of a small book ! the question posed by the author in the prologue is there a providential plan of which we are the agents is answered with a resounding yes when one reaches the end i enjoyed part seven zion the most as it charts the events leading to the restoration of israel and this brave little country s survival against impossible odds those who do not see a divine hand behind the history of the th century must be wilfully blind if this were the only book he had written paul johnson would still be a hero and a genius in my eyes his account of the terrible suffering and the awesome contribution to mankind of the jewish people will stand the test of time but history is still being written despite the fatuous title of fukuyama s famous book there is hope that god s miracle nation will play a greater and happier part in the future this masterpiece concludes with a postscript a glossary extensive source notes and a thorough index

good for leisure reading to unwind a bit i thought this book was not as bad as some of these reviews suggest i didn t think there needed to be a point tyree needed to prove but that it was interesting enough just following this man s life story i bought it at an airport and read most of it on my roundtrip flights it kept my attention except toward the last of the book it is nice to see a book about black people just dealing with relationships life and managing themselves much better than having to use graphic sexuality to maintain reader s interest as i ve noticed a lot of authors doing

dinner with two th century gourmets dinner with two th c gourmetsa book reviewby wilson g duprey gail unzelmanbibliographer novelist and wine historian james gabler has pro duced another capital book an evening with benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson dinner wine and conversation is a marvelous mix of biog raphy travel american diplomatic his tory and wine history the author has used a dream device to place a professor of american history jack osborne who is also a well versed wine historian and connoisseur of wines in the dining room of thomas jefferson s elegant mansion on the champs elysees in paris his fellow dinner guest is benjamin franklin prof osborne is informed of the evening s menu and then asked to choose the wines for the dinner jack is familiar with the wines that jefferson had acquired for his cellar and is honored with the request the wines and the menu dorsey s champagne aperitif meursault goute d or normandy oysters montrachet spaghetti tossed with olive oil parmesan cheese and an chovies haut brion beef la mode served with ch margaux potatoes two kinds of peasfrom jefferson s garden ch yquem ice cream in puff pastry the dinner produced lively conversation on into the night one of the most interesting parts of this book is thomas jefferson s story mostly in his own words taken from his voluminous papers both archived and published he tells about his month trip through southern france and into northern italy over the icy alps part of the way by mule back tasting wines and keeping meticulous notes on the wines and their histories he canvassed the wines of burgundy the m doc and bordeaux and everything in between whether grand ch teau or tiny vineyard he checked the composition of the soils met the owners and asked about vineyard practices and often ordered wines to his liking for his parisian cellar and his cellar at monticello he of course met many of the wine merchants some of whom he had dealt with for years he soon learned that buying wine bottled at the vineyard provided more certainty of getting what he ordered for there was much blending of wines by the merchants in italy he learned of the wine nebiule todays nebbiolo among many others new to him he was also able to smuggle out in his pockets some of the supposedly superior piedmont rice to send home to a south carolina friend who planted it and found carolina s rice more to his liking throughout this journey jefferson visited all the natural architectural and historical elements including ruins arenas temples and the famous roman aqueduct near nimes wherever he went he attended the plays operas and other local entertainments he ate in fine restaurants if possible and tasted the local wines like other travelers of the time he suffered the indignities and barbarities of the taverns and hotels along the rural roads but nonetheless he enjoyed his time and received a first hand glimpse of much of france and northern italy jefferson made a wine tour through germany as well again tasting and taking copious notes while he experienced the fine wines of the moselle johannis berg hochheim and rudesheim in addition to buying german wines for his cellars at paris and monticello he bought vine shoots that he planted in his paris garden intending to transplant them to monticello all through the evening professor osborne im parted current st century information to jefferson and franklin about the vineyards in france italy and germany and let them know that many of the great vineyards of the th century were still producing superb wines the professor asked many questions of his dinner companions their answers were straight forward despite being asked often intimate details of their lives and those of their wives children friends and enemies jefferson was born an aristocrat a virginia planter with thousands of acres of productive land he owned slaves and was an important figure in the often volatile virginia legislature jefferson considered his three most important legacies the declaration of independence helped write it and signed it the american constitution helped create and the founding and development of the university of virginia at charlottesville franklin on the other hand was born in boston and struggled to become a printer s apprentice at age fourteen eventually he arrived in philadelphia and found success in the printing business he went on to become postmaster invent the franklin stove and bifocal eye glasses do his electrical lightning experiments and become a first class entrepreneur able to retire at age in now aged he began his long and illustrious career in public life he was appointed in as american minister to france where he served until when he then asked congress to allow him to retire so he could return home now an elderly man jefferson succeeded him as minister the two statesmen had been friends in philadelphia at the time of the writing of the declaration of independence franklin enjoyed his new duty of introducing young jefferson to the french ministry intelligentsia aristocratic and social circles all vitally important in diplomatic relations jefferson stayed on at paris as american minister until when he came back to the u s with his two daughters he intended to return to paris but he became involved in national politics was elected president and would never see france again conversation flowed during the evening it seems that a favorite topic was the lady friends of both men jefferson a new widower when he arrived in paris told of only one emotional affair with maria cosway the famous artist alas it did not survive franklin reminded the professor that he had married in philadelphia but his wife had a mortal fear of sea journeys and never joined him for his overseas assignments franklin s life in london suited him so well that he returned to philadelphia only once for two years when he returned to london his loving wife carried on his business affairs at home until her death franklin enjoyed the company of a fine lady friend and named three his london landlady his neighbor in passy and the third was one of the most beautiful ladies in france according to abigail adams none of the ladies succumbed to his amorous eye but all were extremely attentive friends we get a good picture of john adams the massa chusetts signer of the declaration and one time friend to jefferson they would become dire opponents in later presidential campaigns a mile journey with jefferson s close virginia friend james madison is taken through the revolutionary battle fields in new york and surrounding areas naval hero john paul jones is newly introduced in coastal english waters and the marquis de lafayette is revealed in cloak and dagger activities both jefferson and franklin speak long and well of george washington both as general and as president while in france jefferson was honored to send french wines to the capitol for washington s table later on jefferson wrote a most informative letter to newly elected president madison about the wines he should import for the white house with names dealers agents cost per bottle and directions for bottling and shipping abroad among the wines jefferson recommended was the famous italian wine montepulciano from tuscany there are almost one hundred vignette photos scattered throughout the book views of cities of france italy germany england scotland ireland and the united states and portraits of individuals all reflecting the late th century scene of jefferson and franklin following the elaborate and detailed bibliographic notes for the text are a few extra bonuses the fascinating story about the bottle of ch lafite with the embossed initials thj that sold for at a new york auction recipes for jefferson s beef la mode browned flour and mushroom catsup all from a new cookbook dining at monticello in this fictional but fact based imaginative and fascinating journey james gabler provides a vivid portrait of jefferson and franklin as true gourmets enjoying the finest of food and wine jefferson s almost four month tasting extravaganza through the vineyards of france and italy surely classes him as the th century s wine connoisseur par excellence in a sense the two gentlemen were the jet setters of the eighteenth century ! 
monumental weird funny sobering that the author won the nobel may suade the reader one way or another but as this work is what got him the prize which to me says the nobel must be worth something if you don t know canetti s work you won t get the impression from the title that the man is incredibly funny but he is and yet his brand of humor comes only from surgical precise observation of the ordinary canetti is the montaigne of our time of modernity bearing all the marks and scars of our age if canetti s prose has the disarming rambling style that we associate with montaigne s it also has the latter s power to draw out the most unexpectedly profound from the ordinary sort of like old fencing masters they never run never sweat are never fancy but they always beat you to the jugular all the scholarship all the discipline is hidden like the hull of a ship that keeps the whole thing afloat in this book without torturing language canetti tells you more about the nature of power than foucault and more about the nature of crowds than a room full of social psychologists that such a feat is possible ought to be a sobering lesson in itself canetti s book is a wonderful mix of the potentially tedious kangaroo behavior and the funky for example in describing the psychology of mass fear as it relates to its twin the desire to out survive others he cites unexpected examples burial customs in rural india in which a strenuous attempt is made to appease the spirit of the child if it dies a preventable death the peculiar madness of roman emperors and the viking warriors tradition of piling up a mound of stones before going into battle each warrior brings a stone and adds to the pile after battle each warrior removes one stone thus leaving a mound of stones that would represent the dead contemplating by the fire the remaining mound was immensely satisfying to the survivors apparently canetti s notion of the crowd is never just a bunch of people canetti defines crowd as a cumulation of small units into a large ensemble causing it to become something entirely different from the units that make it up he sees nature as the teacher that taught man to behave as a crowd as a liquid for example for the germans it is the forest with its innumerable trees standing vertically that has inspired the german soul since time primordial in its aspiration to become a marching liquid for the arabs it is the sand of the desert for the dutch it is the threatening sea itself for the mongols the wind etc canetti s prose is muscular never bloated given that he was a man of letters and not an anthropologist it may be of some significance that his lifelong project it took him some years to write this book was shaped by his lifelong preference for a world as envisioned by the ancient greeks and the ancient chinese in matters literary moral and philosophical his science is the science of a man confident in his experience and aristocratic power of observation canetti never sets out to convince he has nothing to sell it is his style to simply put it in front of you and then leave take it or leave it but this book will never leave you once you begin it 
a voice from the radio says read this book white noise is quite possibly the most enjoyable book i ve ever read don delillo creates a humorous account of a middle aged man jack gladney obsessed with death and its inevitability in his writing delillo suggests that americans use consumerism as a way of warding of death which is one of the novels running themes the characters in the novel are oddly outrageous with their fanatic conversations about the recollection of trivial things like where were you the first time you brushed your teeth with your finger or where were you when james dean died the dialogue throughout the novel is brilliant and at one point a father son conversation about rain coaxes the reader into questioning the validity of his or her own senses the novel also shows how people are infatuated by televised disastrous events white noise reads like a demented sitcom full of dark comedy and unique neurotic characters that keep you entertained and interested through its entirety if you enjoy comical and creative writing then read this book

not much hope it would have been a gigantic undertaking to write howard w french s kind of book about all of africa africa is after all a large continent with the greatest diversity in species ecosystems peoples languages and histories french does not attempt such a challenge his primary focus is the part of africa that he knows best central africa and its complex history since independence while he draws some general conclusions for africa resulting from the colonial carving up of the continent his concern are the events in the heart of africa given the common misconception that africa can be regarded as one unitary region the title a continent for the taking strikes me as somewhat unsuitable and the subtitle as misleading only a few chapters relate french s travels in other countries all in west africa and almost all struggling with their own post colonial catastrophes such as sierra leone and liberia one notable exception is mali where recent history has demonstrated that democratic development is possible despite political environmental challenges and severe poverty of the vast majority of the population here french finds some of hope among the tragedies french feels privileged for his position given his personal background and family connections in and to the region as west africa representative for the new york times between and he traveled extensively in the region the book records one major political crisis after another most of those happened to occur in zaire in the last years of mobutu s reign french complements his current affairs coverage with reflections on the impacts of colonial history and political power play during the cold war while he places the responsibility of much of the ongoing crisis in the region at the feet of the former colonial powers especially belgian s king leopold his outspoken critique is particularly poignant regarding the us and its philosophy of african solutions for african problems supporting authoritarian strongmen and dictators he argues has been more important for american foreign policy than promoting nascent democracy and the protection of human rights despite the known brutality and rampant frauds of mobutu s regime he was only dropped from the list of acceptable african leaders when another equally ruthless strongman laurent kabila stood at the gates of kinshasa the capital french was also a close and disparaging observer of the us welcome for kabila as the new president french writes with great empathy and passion for the peoples living in central africa the two congos one of them the former zaire as well as the displaced refugees from rwanda they are the real victims of the regimes and the continuing power plays by western governments these are more interested he suggests in the exploitation of rich natural resources oil diamonds and metals than in good governance and democratic participation by the population for example french follows groups of desperate hutu refugees from one camp to another exposing the participation of the rwandan army post genocide in massacres and violence against the refugees and related tribal groups in eastern zaire he laments the rwandan government s continuing profound involvement with the events in zaire congo and explores the reasons why the us administration failed to intervene he interleaves his investigative reporting of events with descriptions of his encounters with many individuals whether opposition leaders artists hutu refugees or just plain village folk suffering from the fighting in their surroundings his direct approach invites the reader to follow his travels into remote areas of the lush rainforests or the wide ranging savanna he focuses our attention on the individuals he meets and their circumstances reflecting their perspectives on local events he lets them convey their views directly in dialogue with him it is somewhat disappointing that an important book like french s published in stops in when he left his position in the region one can appreciate his frustration and sense his exhaustion from four years of crisscrossing the difficult terrain nevertheless the reader would have greatly benefited from and expected some kind of epilogue on the various events still unfolding when he described them also for those not that familiar with the contemporary history of central africa a summary of historical chronology would have assisted in placing the events described more comprehensively friederike knabe ottawa canada 
the time machine review contains spoilers this is a good scientific book that is based on time traveling in this book there is the time traveler and the narrator the narrator take the lead roll when the book is talking about the meetings the time traveler has at his house as the story starts out the time traveler creates a miniature time machine that disappears in front of the narrator and the guests when the time traveler goes into the future with his time machine he stops in the year ad he sees the small robbed creatures that are called eloi at first he tries to learn their language but they get bored and go away as he is discovering the land the other creatures morlocks stole his time machine and put it in the sphinx statue when he discovers his time machine is missing he panics and scares the eloi then on his adventure of discovering the land again he comes across wells and quickly learns that there are creatures down there before he enters the wells he saves an eloi from the river this eloi s name is weena the time traveler figures out the eloi are scared of the dark because the morlocks attack them in the dark after the time traveler goes into the wells and scares the morlocks with fire he returns to the land and runs away to a safe place palace of green poreclain with weena when he discovers that the palace of green poreclain is a museum he gets flammable substance and matches which are not around in this time on there way back to the sphinx statue he and weena are attacked by the morlocks the time traveler sets a small fire to keep them safe which inturns creates a large forest fire during the forest fire the morlocks take weena so the time traveler follows them in hope to find safety and weena when he gets back to the sphinx he finds that the door is open so he goes in and the morlocks close the door so the time traveler can not escape with the time machine right in front of his eyes he fights off the morlocks and shoots into the future where he discovers the end of time as he goes back in time to tell his story he gets to his laboratory and forgets what happened to him then he tells everyone he will be back in a half an hour to gather evidence that he traveled he never comes back again i liked this book because it was easy to put your self with the time traveler and go through all of his experiences 
a good adjunct to orgo just like chemistry for dummies this text covers all of first semester orgo scratches the surface of the beginning of semester two and thats it of course its not going to cover everything or it would be a textbook but it covers the need to know topics and explains them well this is a great adjunct to the text and course to be honest it really didn t make any sense until i had taken the course and learned what i was reading this has great information that your prof may have left out and or it usually has a different way of explaining something which may help or enforce what you ve already learned for example the diels alder reactions in my orgo class we had a page section on it in our notes did practice problem and were told to make sure you know this for the test this book definately saved me here with a thourough explanation of how why what to do etc i fully understood the reaction i read it before class but none of it made any sence but going to class turns on the light bulb and reading it before class is a great way to make learning orgo i much easier there are a few other adjuncts out there that may help the standard deviants vhs set the deep fried world of organic chemistry may be helpful have fun in class 
great book a fantastic book pure delight perfect from the first page to the last consistent quality a book one cannot leave aside 
lonesome traveler is a completely unique experience on the road instantly became my favorite book after reading it a short time ago and of course it prompted me to read more of kerouac in hopes of attaining that same free spirted prose he is known for lonesome traveler delivers a much different experience to the reader than does on the road but is equally as moving the flow of this book can be hard to follow at first but i found the more i read the more i began to quotbequot kerouac many times i found myself reading a passage over and over again in an attempt to completely and fully understand the feelings and emotions kerouac is trying to convey the end result is a longer read than the number of pages may suggest but a priceless experience that is rarely found in modern literature 
basic readable reference this work is a self conscious prcis of the current professional norms of political psychology which loosely presents itself as applying what is best known in psychology to political science in many ways political psychology puts a human face on social political processes that addresses motives as well as clusters of behavior needing explication that soft pedals reductive theory for more empirical observation quantified from many events and cultural circumstances the essays in handbook of political psychology serve to convey the general nature and range of the subject while also being a guide to the central issues and studies in the field it belongs in every political science library 
very highly recommended representations and characters of finite groups are a classical subject with substantial developments well underway a century ago as a result there has been gradual refinement and polishing of the field the beauty of this subject is shown well in this book the style is clear and order of exposition excellent moreover the authors write with great patience both in respect to presenting calculations in detail and in providing the steps to proofs this is not to say the book is easy but rather that the distance from step to step is very well suited for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students the book is highly mathematical in its outlook except for the final chapter which deals with normal modes of vibration of a molecule there are some real gems in a certain finite group is it possible to find an element of order two and one of order four whose product has order three the answer may be found in the chapter quotan application to group theory quot the presentation of the frobenius reciprocity theorem is a exceptional delight as for prerequisites a good grounding in general group theory at an undergraduate level and a reasonably good acquaintance with rings and modules should suffice 
read it again for the first time with the identity of deep throat now known all the president s men has an added bit of excitement i couldn t help but think wasnt it obvious as i read it and thought of deep throat s true identity reading it i realized that woodward and bernstein didn t try to hide the secret as well as all the speculation over the last years would lead one to believe dont be like the taxi driver i had late one night in d c this summer who said he didn t need to read this book because i lived through it man that guy was a jerk he would not shut up

wonderful and i d give it more stars if i could i wasn t ready to say goodbye is such a wonderful wonderful book ! to see my thoughts actions and feelings of everything that comes along during the grief of a loved one particularly one lost by a sudden death i was even comforted by carrying it with me for over a year just having it near me helped so that i could read it anytime i recently borrowed it to my best friend who just lost her younger sister to suicide and i actually feel very naked without my copy my favorite aunt was murdered by my uncle her husband my mom s brother and then he committed suicide trying to deal with it was so hard because i felt there was no one in the world who understood my pain my fears my irrational thoughts griefbursts guilt and that overwhelming feeling of being lost this book helped me to find my way to know that everything i was feeling and thinking was completely normal and just to see it all in print is such a relief i ve also lost an uncle to a heart attack friends to suicide other friends to vehicle accidents and also the loss of a grandparent who died of old age and this book has helped me to accept all those i ve lost in the past and to realize that all people grieve differently that there is no time frame for it and that no one can tell you when you re ready to move on this book gives the griever power to accept what has happened and move through the grieving process and to understand it a little better this book teaches you the grief process from just about every point of view possible parent child sibling friend etc gives you tips on how to cope and memoralize the ones you ve lost advice on where to seek professional help when needed and the writers tell their own stories of loss and everything they experienced i wasn t ready to say goodbye mentions the taboos surrounding sudden deaths such as suicide or homicide and lets you know that it s ok to talk about it and that you need to talk about it just an absolutely wonderful book on grief after a sudden death loss there are very few out there that will compare to this one especially since this isn t a book about faith as many grief books are it s a straight forward grieving process gold mine ! i also purchased the workbook that accompanies this one however i did not get around to actually doing it so i don t know if it would be helpful for those of you who are comfortable with journaling the workbook would be an excellent compliment to the text sorry for those of you who are having to look for this but i am telling you this is a wonderful book and one of the best out there ! 
suitable preparation for actuary exam p i used this book as well as the soa sample exams as my sole means of preparation for the actuary examination p ross does an excellent job of utilizing a plethora of examples in order teach a particular concept in some cases a chapter may consist of two pages of instruction followed by dozens of examples this method tends to be extremely effective with regard to test preparation but more frustrating for students using this as a course textbook the proofs provided are fairly vigorous but a strong background in calculus is essential to understanding any significant portion of this book the chapter discussing jointly distributed random variables is the longest in the book and perhaps rightly so considering this comprises the majority of the p exam however in pages of text about five pages involves a formal discussion of terms and proofs and the rest is made up of about examples many which span multiple pages again this happens to be quite effective when paired with the soa example questions but may prove to be a difficult text to follow when a professor expects you to understand the finer points of probability theory if you can answer every question provided in a sample exam packet you will easily pass the exam and you will master the sample exam if you spend several months covering the first seven chapters of this book

awesome series first in the emerald o brian chintz n china mysteries and it grabs you from the beginning if you like a little fright with your mystery you will love this series this book got me hooked and made me crave more emerald adventures and a nice hot cup of tea 
well written colorful informative and important this wonderful book was recommended to me by a dear friend who is a professor of economics at the university of michigan i purchased it awhile back but only got around to reading it recently and i know i should have read it sooner it is delightfully written and very informative the author takes us through each of the models that have been developed for estimating aid to developing countries since world war ii and the trillions of dollars that have poured into those countries with almost no positive effect he explores possible reasons why this has happened he starts with a sound fundamental principle that people respond to incentives and then shows how the measurements made and the programs developed have almost universally created perverse incentives to growth too often these programs have left the world s most vulnerable no better off and too often in worse shape than before because of the dependency they develop on the rivers of money pouring in what is particularly enjoyable about this book is that the author doesn t go around assigning blame or looking for bad guys sure he does find some who misuse their authority and disregard their responsibilities for personal gain but for the most part he shows us how well intentioned programs provided perverse incentives we should not be surprised or even disappointed that people chose behaviors that resulted in their own gain the author also takes on issues surrounding luck bad governments that kill growth ethnic diversity and growth and the issues surrounding debt forgiveness how it should and should not be done easterly provides an insightful vignette at the beginning of each chapter and illustrates his points within the chapters with many anecdotes this is far from a dry academic paper but it is thoughtful and intelligent it is readable by the average person likely to be interested in alleviating poverty in the third world through growth the author provides several pages of other works that should be consulted on this topic i have read and reviewed hernando de soto s magnificent the mystery of capital and economic growth by david weil i strongly recommend this to everyone because we all need to be better informed about these international issues the everyday media misleads and misinforms more than it helps and politicians pander rather than lead so fellow citizens it is up to us

usefulness of the handbook this handbook is a great asset for any college student that requires a great reference on all types of writing formats in an english course the handbook does clearify alot of misconceptions with writing formats such as mla apa chicago manual and many others it also provides you examples on how the papers using such writing formats should appear on a paper i was able to even use for my research papers in history class even though i got it originally for my english course enc 
very enjoyable and informative read the history buff s guide to the civil war by thomas r flagel was very informative and provided this individual with many bits of information that haven t been seen before as an individual who reads twenty or more civil war books each year i would strongly recommend this read to those who desire those little bits and pieces that are not usually found in more well known publications the book is well written and presented in very readable fashion well done 
good but lacking in comparison scene of the crime is the latest in a recent influx of collections of crime scene photography and it has added appeal in that some of the images are of famous cases such as the black dahlia murder and the manson family slaughterhouse the book is laid out in the same manner as most of these books with black and white images presented in the first half of the book and information for each photograph at the back unfortunately many of the photographs piqued my curiosity only to find a sad unsatisfying case information unavailable comment awaiting me in the back of the book still many of the images are so well composed and interesting that they could be seen in art museums rather than cold case files so this is a minor quibble however there are also quite a few lesser and uninteresting images as well which left me feeling a bit cheated given my suspicion that the lapd coffers are overflowing with many more graphic historic and fascinating images comparing this book to the classic la crime gallery death scenes a homicide detective s scrapbook serves to further point out this collection s shortcomings there is nothing in here as punch inthegut brutal as the image of the decapitated baby on the cutting board or as surreal as the peaceful head sitting in the middle of a road after a traffic accident both from death scenes taken on its own merits i might have given the book a five skull rating but in comparison with its more amazing brethren i d have to rate it a four

deja vu for chandler fans excellent for all chandler fans reading this book for the first time will have many deja vu moments the book contains four of the twenty short stories written by chandler in the s that were warm ups for the seven novels that followed chandler wrote detective mystery stories and became famous for seven novels and a number of hollywood screen plays mostly about crime and private detectives in the film noir genre of hollywood black and white films or what is called la pulp fiction far from being an ordinary writer of cheap crime stories chandler became one of america s best writers from the mid th century chandler was a los angeles accountant turned writer and he developed his own careful writing style he started by first analysing other works such as articles in the black mask mystery magazine he used those stories plus local newspaper crime articles for plot ideas he would set some of his stories in the fictional ocean side town of bay city which is really santa monica or set his stories in west los angeles or other parts of southern california he lived in santa monica after being fired from his oil executive job for drinking in the s he detested the place and moved into la proper when he became wealthy as a screenplay writer in the early s while working at paramount in the late s he moved to la jolla just north of san diego chandler started with short fiction pieces in the s and then graduated to novels in from the early novels he was hired to write screen plays and eventually he wrote or created works including stories screenplays and novels his novels with the private detective phillip marlowe brought him fame including the bogart bacall movie the big sleep this book contains four short stories each about to pages long from the s these are a warm ups to his seven novels and screenplays that followed there are plot elements and prose that are almost a duplicate of some of the later novels for example the second story finger man has scenes and references that are almost directly inserted into the big sleep and farwewell my lovely for chandler lovers like myself it is like eating chocolates to go back and be able to read these early works also chandler has a four page introduction where he makes a number of comments on his writing style and philosophy at the front of the book trouble is my business is the first of the four short stories his career did not take off until after he had written three or four novels and started to do screenplays in the mid s he was lucky in that he was able to write the screenplays and make a lot of money he became famous for the screenplays but simultaneously he rose to further fame by the growth in popularity of paperback books in the s as a result millions of his philip marlowe detective novels were sold and after just a few years he had moved from a run down flat in santa monica to a large house with an ocean view beside the kellog family in la jolla he is now recognised as one of america s best writers from the s through s era if you get a chance have a look at the movie double indemnity where chandler co wrote the screenplay with billy wilder at paramount his first attempt at this type of writing and he and wilder were nominated for an oscar but they did not win i think that is an excellent film and it is generally regarded as one of the best films of the period his technique was to pull old stories apart then change them then re write them as short stories and then take that work and extend it modify it again a second or third time or even more and finally put together complete novels he would take six months to write a short story as found in the present collection while some other mystery writers wrote a complete novel in a week by dictation he was not big on plots but more of a craftsman on the individual scenes and the prose especially descriptions of the people he said that it took him two years to write a short description of a person getting up from a table and walking out of a room so there is a high level of refinement and a certain style that he was able to develop as a result of this writing process this technique is not new shakespeare himself used this technique in virtually every play taking old myths stories and historical accounts such as king lear he would break them apart change them and make new works with new twists turns and addnew characters his last play the tempest is his thought to be his only completely original play chandler used to joke that if shakespeare was alive he would be a hollywood writer chandler is a little more obvious in that some of the prose in the seven novels are almost lifted from the early works in part because chandler wrote only one half page increments at a time and kept those half page writings on file to use as source materials for later works his aim was to make each segment as complate as possible but some of his early short stories are similar to and have almost identical names to the full novels in any case this is a book that is not to be missed by chandler fans and it is simply excellent for anyone else 
absolutely wonderful i ve had this book for three years and it is really terrific so many new ideas and great recipes this has really opened my world and gotten me to expand my vegetarian diet great writing easy to read really love this book i turn to this book every week get it 
this book is fantastic i read a lot of spiritual or metaphysical books but this one is definately one of the best most personally useful ones i just started it yesterday and although i am only half way through i am so excited by the information within i could not wait to rave about it and recommend it to family and friends it is so enlightening to me in explaining my negative thought patterns and how programming from childhood has influenced my entire life no wonder louise hay is a guru to so many new age type authors i am reading sections aloud to my husband i am underlining passages to re read later i see myself so clearly in the examples given as well as other people i love in my life although i did not buy this book through amazon like many others i ve read i would most definately purchase it again for a gift or advise somebody i really cared for that could use this kind of revelation to buy it my copy is the earlier printing so i can only assume more recent re printing dates are at least as good or improved do not hesitate you need to read this book you deserve it and can really benefit from it 
a comedy of great proportions i don t know why i never knew about a confederacy of dunces when it was first published but i just listened to it as an audiobook and it was one of the most enjoyable books i ve experienced in years the book is an impressive character study and commentary on new orleans and the world in general in the early s everyone of the characters in this story is so lifelike and beautifully crafted so that you feel these are people you know not just characters in a book the dialogue is pure genius the protagonist ignatius j reilly is hilarious as the big intellectual slob who is always criticizing and pontificating at everyone from his mother to the people who are trying to buy hot dogs from him on the street the jones character is superb the super wise and wisecracking cynical down andout black man i loved them all ignatius his mother irene mr and mrs levy patrolman mancuso lana lee darlene miss annie well maybe not myrna minkoff and miss trixie so much but they all had a role to play i simply didn t want the book to end it was like losing your new found friends this is a book you don t want to miss read it or better yet buy it as the audiobook read by barrett whitener you are in for a rare treat 
great practical information educational professionals who appreciate todd whitaker s approach will enjoy ryan delaney s mission accomplished by anna t erickson

honestly biased i just finished reading terry eagleton s literary theory an introduction for the third time in years and was even more impressed than before i agree to a large extent with the other reviewers on this thread who called eagleton to task for his obvious biases from the beginning of the book however eagleton makes it clear that his is a biased history of modern literary theory while he eventually slams most of the theories he presents for one reason or another he also has the admirable ability to present each theory in a favorable light before saying what he thinks is wrong with it again and again i found myself won over by a theory only to have it torn apart after which he would present the next theory and i would say ah now this is more like it at which time he would pull the rug out from under that one the important thing to keep in mind when studying any account of critical theory including and especially this one is to be critical it would be as much of a mistake to take eagleton s word as gospel as it would anyone else s if you read this with what psychologist charles tart called an open mind discriminating mind it s a fine overview of a dense and potentially hermetic field of study eagleton doesn t provide the final word on any of these theories but i think this book is an excellent jumping off point for further inquiry 
essays from the evil mind joe coleman is represented in other books but the essays in this book along with the reproductions give the viewer an intimate glimpse into the twisted and detailed paintings of joe coleman ! a bargain 
autobiography par excellence running with the bulls is autobiography par excellence valerie hemingway openly and frankly tells the fascinating story of her life which began as valerie danby smith her mother was english catholic her father irish protestant and their marriage failed young valerie grew up in a convent in ireland literally and she spent the summers of her youth when the convent school was closed at a country hotel that attracted artists and writers aspiring to be a journalist young danby smith went to spain there she went to interview the american author ernest hemingway then years old and enthusiastically visiting sites from his earlier days thus the yearold irish woman began figuratively running with the bulls danbysmith became hemingway s secretary and confidant she traveled in spain and france with the hemingway entourage she moved to cuba to help the writer but soon the cuban revolution forced the hemingways to leave cuba danby smith went to new york city to pursue her career and the hemingways moved to idaho there ernest hemingway committed suicide at his funeral danby smith met hemingway s youngest son gregory long estranged from the family for reasons she did not learn until many years later with fidel castro s complacency she helped hemingway s widow smuggle the famous author s manuscripts and art collection out of cuba for several years thereafter she sorted the hemingway papers at the office of his publisher in new york city when she married gregory hemingway he was a young doctor in new york the marriage took her to florida back to new york and later to montana where the tragic drama of gregory s life eventually brought the marriage to an end nothing in this book is expected if the book were a novel the reader would not believe the story the famous characters the twists and turns but the story is true and valerie hemingway lived it she tells her story with grace discretion and the skill of a fine journalist whose early mentor had been the legendary ernest hemingway at the time she was hired ernest hemingway had stipulated that a requirement of employment was that she would not write about the family she honored that requirement but years have passed and others have written about her relationship with ernest hemingway so the time came for valerie hemingway to tell it like it was it was an adventure

straightforward good beginner information this is actually a pretty good book for those first entering the realm of the yoruba religion it has some good straightforward beginner information i don t agree with every aspect of this book however as i dont see the need to constantly compare our religion to others our elemental energies to chakras etc but simply because i don t agree with everything included does not change the fact that it is a good yoruba primer 
creative ideas for camping this really is a cool book with all sorts of ideas for cooking in the outdoors many that i had never thought of like cooking eggs and bacon in a bag stuck on a stick over the fire the first part of the book talks about outdoor cooking at home and has some neat frugal ideas for outdoor parties then the book delves into camping for a chapter or so dian has some really good organizational ideas for large and small groups the last of the book is devoted to camp cooking the ideas for cooking over the fire are really cool and for someone who has done only a bit of camping and car camping at that really unusual however if you like your food fresh and not from a can or packet the recipes are pretty useless here are your cakes made from cake mix and canned fruit casseroles with cream of whatever soup and all sorts of seasoning packets if this sort of thing does nt bother you then the book should be perfect if you re a health nut like me it will 
still damned funny okay having read every single one of barry s books i d agree that this is not his absolute funniest but i still laughed out loud every other page or so i consider barry the most hilarious writer alive bar none this may not be his funniest book but it s still funnier than of the other books out there 
lord of my love to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty not to show my wit sonnet how to do justice to the legacy of literary history s greatest mind moreover in such a limited review forget goethe s universal genius and his rebel contemporary schiller forget the th century masters forget contemporary literature with the possible exception of three greek gentlemen named aischylos sophocles and euripides a certain frenchman called poquelin aka moliere and that infamous irishman oscar wilde there s more wit in a single line of shakespeare s than in an entire page of most other even great authors works and i m not saying this in ignorance of or in order to slight any other writer it s precisely my admiration of the world s literary giants past and present that makes me appreciate shakespeare even more and that although i m aware that he repeatedly borrowed from pre existing material and that even the sole authorship of the works published under his name isn t established beyond doubt for ultimately the only thing that matters to me is the brilliance of those works themselves and quite honestly the mysteries continuing to enshroud his person to me only enhance his larger thanlife stature the precise dating of shakespeare s sonnets like other poets a response to the publication of sir philip sidney s astrophil and stella is an even greater guessing game than that of his plays although and slightly modified appeared in s passionate pilgrim most were probably circulated privately and written years before their first unauthorized though still authoritative publication possibly beginning in formatwise they adopt the elizabethan fourteen linestructure of three quatrains of iambic pentameters expressing a series of increasingly intense ideas resolved in a closing couplet with an abab cdcdefefgg rhyme form sole exceptions first quatrain amplified by one line six couplets only twelve lines total written in tetrameter and omission of the second line s beginning the subject of a lasting debate their order is thematic rather than chronological although beyond the fact that the first are addressed to a young man maybe the earl of pembroke or southampton maybe sir robert dudley the natural son of queen elizabeth s sweet robin the earl of leicester the first seventeen possibly commissioned by the addressee s family pressing his marriage and production of an heir and or and to an exotic woman of questionable virtues only known as the dark lady even in that respect much remains unclear including the nature of shakespeare s relationship with the two main addressees regarding which the sonnets often ambiguous metaphors invoke much speculation is probably addressed to shakespeare s wife the closing couplet plays on her maiden name i hate from hate away she threw and saved my life saying not you hathaway anne saved my life several others contain puns on the name will and its double meaning s exactly fourteen in the naughty whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will and seven in the similarly mischievous and the last two draw on the then popular cupid theme sometimes placement seems linked to contents e g in music an octave has eight notes and time twelve hours to both day and night sixty minutes to an hour and in the famous which praises poetry s everlasting power and as whose never expresslynamed subject shakespeare himself emerges in a comparison with horace s ode in turn written in first person singular and thus denoting its own author as the builder of its monument more lasting than bronze exegi monumentum aere perennius as well as through the number s optical similarity to the letter s making the sonnet s number a shorthand reference for hakepeare or hakespeares onnets echoed by numerous words containing an s in the text of indescribable linguistic beauty elegance and complexity shakespeare s sonnets owe their timeless appeal to their supreme compositional values the universality of their themes and their keen insights into the human heart and soul as much as their transcendence of the era s poetic conventions which following petrarch heavily idealized the addressee s qualities a form new and exciting twohundred years earlier but encrusted in cliche in the late s indeed shakespeare s dark lady sonnet owes its particular fame to its clever puns on that very style which went overboard with references to its golden haired starry beamy sparkling sunny eyed cherry strawberry vermilion coral lipped rosy crimson purple dawn cheeked ivory lily carnation crystal silver snowy swan white skinned pearl teethed honey nectar music tongued goddess like objects my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun the bard countered proceeded to describe her breasts as dun her hair as black wires and her breath as reeking and denied her any divine or angelic attributes and yet he concluded by heaven i think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare arguably shakespeare s very choice of addressees a young man also the subject of the famously romantic shall i compare thee to a summer s day the first of several sonnets promising his immortalization in poetry as well as the dark lady in turn introduced under the notion black is beautiful in itself suggests a break with tradition and compared to his contemporaries poetry even the equally famous s on its face rather conventional praise of love s constancy let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments echoed in the poet s vow to vanquish time in sounds fairly restrained but ultimately shakespeare s sonnets like his entire work simply defy categorization they are as rival ben jonson acknowledged written for all time just as the bard himself immodestly claimed gainst death and all oblivious enmityshall you pace forth your praise shall still find roomeven in the eyes of all posteritythat wear this world out to the ending doom sonnet

fabulous this is the best book i have found for a general study of the of neural networks i found this particularly useful when looking at how to write my own nn frameworks the depth of the mathematics allowed me to easily answer questions like what if i replaced function abc with xyz i have found other texts failed to show key mathematical derivations or to explore the subtleties of what the maths imply the book covers a plethora of topics from simple gradient descent through second order techniques and conjugate gradient through to the use of bayesian techniques basically confidence intervals on network outputs monte carlo techniques etc similarly error functions non linearities sigmoids softmax etc and data preparation are all treated the extensive bibliography also provides excellent references for further study a whos who of the field as well as actual titles my copy is now dog earred from frequent reading 
fun to share with others the illustrations are delightful for this traditional story a great gift for any child or adult 
great information for online promotion hi i am a realtor in the fl keys with web sites i found the information in this book very helpful it pointed out very specific ways to promote a site and also provided good sources for backup it is hard to find material these days like this that really point out ways to promote yourself online that really work 
great source of historical information this book is excellent el konigsburg describes the apprentice salai s service to leonardo very well it seems as if you are watching it take place before you instead of in reality reading it the mona lisa has always been a mystery how leonardo labored painting a merchant s wife whilst other noble families begged him for theirs to be done such as isabella d este the thing that really fascinated me throughout this book was that it was all based on something real this book was supposed to be a book report ended up being my spare reading book that i read when i had spare time ahh thank god for book reports 
style and tragedy i enjoyed the review by eric karl anderson but i d like to add a few things about anderson s identity interpretation on the five characters that thread nightwood and its meanings in the introduction of the book t s eliot wrote a preface which prepared the readers from possible misunderstandings for djuna barnes brilliant story written in prose was a work of creative imagination and not philosophical treatise i read it twice the second time believing it to be a different book from the beginning barnes persuades the reader to dislike robin for her strangeness living but not present a turmoil in the cold that disrupted the farse of other characters reality when she touched their lives robin and doctor matthew are antagonists they represent opposite dimensions of the self the doctor although a brilliant mind accurate in understanding the misery of man is never the less a failure in bondage with humility and the truth in the end he curses robin for existing having transformed also him nora felix and jenny into doomed creatures in a mysterious and horrific sense of how small their lifes became in the chapter go down matthew the doctor and nora could not hold a conversation they spoke to the readers not listening to each other their lives like a ring closing in their personal pain existing only in the past like dummies tragically possessed by death robin killed what they proclaimed as birthright symbolically how she killed son guido who prayed to the virgin by calling the statue mamma loved the last chapter i that despised robins personal distinction of morality was able to finally understand her her nature made her different nor human nor a beast a creature like the night that drifted sonambule through life no other human soul could be so free so they love her but it s not robin they want but who she is the misery in understanding it was not in reach djuna barnes also tells a parallel tale of obsession for an image of love robin is that woman like an iman possessed with a childs memory but that causes a certain attraction to fear in bow down the writer evoked that it was easier to love a lion for its tamer the story and finally robin were irresistable to my imagination there is a tempting invitation from the writer to participate for the lonely souls they become speak to us and robin unaltered by their existance leaves us readers out the book is brilliant like many readers have stated it is a very hard book to fully comprehend in its various contexts i advice those to wait for an appropriate moment in their lives to read this book it answers many questions if we search and dig between words and the quality of a genuine thinker such as djuna barnes 
a family affair fortune s children was a good read for anyone interested in how the rich lived in the late s the author detailed the main characters very well as well as the over the top outlandish homes that these characters resided in it is truly a nice look into that era and what it all meant to be a vanderbilt reading this book has piqued my interest in other books about the first rich family of america once i began reading this book i had trouble putting it down 
should be required reading for everyone on the planet i had never heard of a traumatic brain injury until after my brother suffered from one due to a car crash after four long months of intensive care and rehab we his family still didn t understand his injuries until we read claudia s book we were by my brother s side night and day reading all that we could talking to every doctor nurse and therapist that we could none of them explained brain injury the way claudia does we discovered claudia s book about months after my brother s injuries and i so wish we had known about it from the beginning we would have understood certain situations so much better i think over my head should be required reading for everyone on the planet god bless claudia and i thank her for writing about her experiences 
the best one volume history of the war one volume histories of world war ii are about a dime a dozen most of them seem to have the words cambridge or oxford in their titles ignore the pacific war and are deadly dull for an american miller and commager s book is the best one volume history i have found i say for an american because the focus is on battles in which americans were the participants the brutal eastern front and the war between germany and the soviet union get short shrift the spectacular air land and sea battles of the war between the u s and japan get equal attention with the western front battles in europe miller doesn t spend a whole lot of time on the events leading up to the war on page germany invades poland and the same breakneck speed in moving from one major battle to another continues the analysis of the strategy and politics behind the war is succinct but adequate to enable the reader to understand the big picture what makes this history better than others is the reliance of the authors on the words of the participants in the combat one half or more of the narrative consists of quotes from eyewitnesses mostly soldiers and journalists and this gives a worms eye view of events that seems more valid and certainly more interesting that the detached analysis of many writers this book gives you a good picture and what life was likein the front lines the text is supplemented by many good photos and maps if you are an american and you can only afford to buy one book on world war ii this is the one you want smallchie 
great companion to the factory service manual this book is a great companion to the factory service manual lots of color photos and step by step instructions from routine maintenance to performance upgrades this book has it all 
it s a text book it was very helpful to complete my assignments plus with an online class you have to really have the book or you ll be lost great information in the book that helped me understand ethics better 
one of two of the best books i have ever read this was an excellent murder mystery thriller i loved it i won t be able to wait hours before starting the third it is so suspenseful the whole way through i thought i knew who did it but that changed within minutes because of all the unexpected turns we also learn that if we put god in control the outcome will change majorly if you do decide to read this i strongly suggest reading the first book quotprivate justice quot first it ranked as sky high as this one 
couldn t put it down i know it s a cliche but it s the truth ! i think this would be my favorite coulter to date i don t care if it isn t well researched i didn t recognize the discepencies as i am not a scholar of regency history and culture it was fun and i enjoyed the interaction between the characters it was certainly not boring i would read it again 
very worth reading even though i do not hold some of the same beliefs as kat duff this is a fascinating book i don t see how anyone could read it and not come away with a new gem of understanding to cherish polish and revisit often 
i love this book if you re into discovering strange records this is definitely a book to read the book is separated into chapters some are dedicated to musicians and others are to individual record collectors which are amusing it gives them the chance to talk about the kooky records they ve discovered there s a nice chapter dedicated to yma sumac which taught me things i didn t know apparently she had a concert in too bad i was only four she sums up her career rather nicely and expresses the problem she had at her comeback i can t sing with just two musicians ! 
right on target the gist of the book is to stay out of the arguments let them work it out i have half heartedly done this before but felt guilty for not trying to teach them how to work it out i no longer feel guilty and realize they can learn this on their own amazingly enough they are learning and i am not being brought into daily conversations of he took my gameboy but he called me a baby but he made faces at me and the conversation where every parent is up the creek continues as for the language yeah there is some vulgarity in the book it probably did not need to be there i would not not buy the book because of it just skip on past it and latch on to the points of the book 
great look at howard s development as a writer as is pointed out by the editor of this volume it s a mistake to view kull as many people do as just a conan prototype the kull stories stand well on their own merit and the character is not just a primitive version of conan still i think it s clear that the kull stories represent an earlier less developed phase in howard s meteoric writing career in these stories we can see howard s story telling mastery in an earlier stage of development than in the conan stories it s noteworthy that howard s first conan story was based on one of his last and unsold kull stories by this axe i rule ! for anyone who loves howard s work the stories in this volume represent an essential stage in howard s development as a writer and story teller also conan s hyperborian world was quite literally built upon the ruins of kull s atlantean valusian world to really understand and appreciate conan you have to know kull even if conan had never been created though it would still be worth the readers trouble to meet kull these are superb stories and very important to the development of the american school of fantasy writing what would later become known as sword and sorcery writing 
an absorbing read i bought this book because i like kent nerburn s writing neither wolf nor dog and i was looking for a book to take on vacation well i didn t get to read it on vacation too busy you know how it goes but i sat down with it the first saturday morning after we returned home i literally couldn t put the book down i kept thinking ill stop reading when i get sleepy or restless or bored with reading it never happened i finished the book late that evening it s been a very long time since i ve done that i didn t know anything about chief joseph and i had to look up how to pronounce nez perce but the story is so well written and the characters so balanced and well developed that it was as if i was a part of the story watching the events unfold in front of me my ignorance was probably an advantage because every time i d put the book down i d come right back to it wanting to find out what was going to happen next this is a wonderful book i highly recommend it

enjoyed it great read first book i ve read by rice but now i ll be checking out her other ones 
overall a very unique and informative book i read this book with some anxiety being a college junior and not a psychologist or psychiatrist i learned of it from my dad a philosophy professor i thought it was really superb and answered many question i had about homosexuality for example i am not gay and ever since the matthew shepard incident i have been trying to understand why gay and lesbian people are the targets of hate crimes it didn t seem to me that the motivation for hatred of gays is exactly the same as hatred for other minority groups sexual orientation and psychoanalysis explains the way that the homophobia particularly in men has its roots in childhood particularly the last part of childhood one point it stresses is that it often seems to be traced back to middle school years and is a special type of bullying going back to my own experience with schoolyard bullies when i was in th grade this made a lot of sense i also learned a lot about the different pathways for sexual development in men and women i now understand why homosexuality is not just one thing and how different gay and lesbian people are from each other i was surprised to learn how similar the sexuality of lesbian is to heterosexual women and gay men to heterosexual men even though there are also differences of course not all the material discussed in this book had equal interest for me for example i wasn t all that interested in the last chapter which is about the way psychoanalysts have thought about homosexuality over the years but it was enlightening to better understand why they used to think that homosexuality was a mental illness i did read some freud and some of my teachers hated him and some admired him at least with respect to sex i appreciated knowing which of his theories are simply out of date friedman and downey think that some of freud s views are still helpful as well all in all i give this book an a grade and even though it is demanding it is worth the effort to read it one good thing about it is that it is very clearly written and without psychobabble or jargon 
slice of life with a twist this meticulously observed slice of life showing the writer s motivations is roth s bildungsroman of a fresh new writer a young roth no doubt who has recently won an award studying for a few days in the country at the feet of his hoary idol saul bellow but it is apparently roth whose nature is incorrigibly promiscuous the older writer has not only a devoted but aging wife but a young female houseguest chronicling his life along with the protagonist literary conversations alternate with veiled references to the erotic frustrations of matrimonial imprisonment combined with the lure of the fetching houseguest the protagonist is told by the older writer its like being married to tolstoy he says following his dejected wife out into the snow after an argument that one does not simply leave a woman after thirty years because one wishes to see a new face while drinking his orange juice in the morning roth s literary erotic imagination goes to work in the book s middle after hearing snippets of a conversation that leads the reader to think and him or his protagonist zuckerman to imagine that the fetching woman is the most famous jewish writer of all time and no he is not referring to god a clever literary coming ofage novel with a highly imaginative twist i won t reveal it here as well as the usual rothian semitic and sexual obsessions a slice of life with a twist 
disection of the neocon foreign policy and its affect on the u s this book by two veterans of conservative leaders the reagan and thatcher governments provide a thorough takedown of the neo conservative foreign policy as demonstrated by the now former leadership of the defense department and our current un ambassador among others these center right authors have provided a thorough trouncing of the neocon viewpoint starting with its earliest iterations and ending with a discussion of the current policies and projections of the leadership halper and clarke write many sensible things to me and i am coming from a center left viewpoint this may be one of the most incredible parts of the book i have come of age in my foreign policy thinking since just before and while i would take a more liberal perspective many of the criticisms of the bush administration foreign policy than clarke and halper have they are still the same as my own thoughts this may also be one of the book s demonstrated weaknesses the authors quote heavily from liberal thinkers but cite only scarcely from their fellow conservative intellectuals this seems to be because other more serious conservative criticisms of neocon failings either aren t popular or are non existent if this is the case it is a shame whichever the case this is an excellent book to get the idea that there are those on the right unhappy with iraq and other unilateral foreign adventures undertaken by bush and the neocons 
very well written but a little romance please i think this book was absolutely fantastic i read this book first and then i read the others though i still have to read a couple more a flaw in all the books i have so far read about anne is that the author has created no romance between anne and gilbert i mean a little kissing wouldn t hurt at all and it would make the books so much more romantic and sweet i don t mean to say that the author has to be totally danielle steel but it would have been nice if she had made her books romantic the worst thing in this whole book was the incessant gossiping of the old ladies at the sewing party i skipped it because it was so boring nevertheless i really like these books and i think the author has described the natural beauty very nicely you would feel as if you were there i find anne s children very adorable and i would like to inform the other readers out there that anne has six children jem walter di nan shirley and rilla i recommend this book to all as it is full of laughter and fun 
a satisfying read this book was a valued companion during my commutes to and from work late this summer and i enjoyed it immensely meade s dorothy parker biography what fresh hell is this is one of my all time favorites and while bobbed hair is not nearly as indepth and is not meant to be it provides a very satisfying taste of each woman s life in the s the only flaw for me is that i found edna st vincent millay s behavior tremendously annoying and so did not enjoy sections of the book devoted to her as much as the rest 
ten apples this is an excellent beginning reader it provides practicing counting and even though it follows a predictable sequence it is fun to see what will happen next 
finding and buying your place in the country this is a must read for the professional and novice country real estate buyer we purchased finding and buying your place in the country in and have used it as our source of valuable information since then though the cover is now a bit tattered and dated the book has a prominent place on our bookshelf it was this book that caused us to look realistically at a piece of property and to put emotion aside we can honestly say that the book saved us from making purchasing mistakes that would have been financially devastating back when we had very little money this had to do with investigating access to landlocked property it looked like a good deal until we found we couldn t legally get to the property without going through a lengthy and costly court fight we have purchased over pieces of rural property and have used the book as a primer for each purchase the book s contents prompt us to think out of the box and to question those things that seem to be appropriate on their face but may have underlying problems we suppose it s time to buy the newest revision however we have scrawled notes on the pages of the old book and that provides a year history of the deals we have completed it would be like getting rid of an old friend final note we were prompted to take that step of living a life rather than making a living after reading the book for the first time it gave us the confidence that year olds typically lack thanks to the scher s for making our lives better we wake up every morning to the sounds of a waterfall in the stream that meanders down to our own private lake our dreams came true due in no small part to finding and buying your place in the country 
good start for a great series unfortunately this was not my first vi book but fortunately i enjoyed quotkilling orders quot and quotbitter medicine quot enough to look further i was not disappointed with the my reintroduction ms warshawski is an appealing character to mystery readers women chicagoans and anyone who enjoys reading about a tough intelligent woman rooting out the bad guys not much of a mystery reader i don t really consider myself one and have enjoyed it immensly give it a try 
a godsend as a personal trainer and unfortunate lover of fast food which i never eat but long for this book was a godsend the recipes are easy and taste as close to the real thing as you are going to get if your cooking skill ends with boiling water then the recipes in this book may frustrate you but to the average person they are easy i recommend this to anyone who loves fast food but avoids it for the same reason i do 
the story of the world volume early modern times we love these books ! we couldn t wait till this latest book in the series came out this book like the previous ones is a history written like a story each chapter topic is connected to the next and covers history as it happened all over the world this one covers from about i purchased a book for my year old to help him learn history when history is told in story format so much more is absorbed and remembered later as well as being more engaging reading he loves history now i ended up buying one for his older brother as well because he was always borrowing his brothers book when my year old father came to town a lover of history he picked up the story world and read the whole thing ! he said it was very well written and he mentioned that he was impressed by how straight forward and unbaised it was i remember so little about what i studied in history as a child but i know it will be different for my kids because of the story of the world i catch my son sneaking in a few chapters when he is suppose to be doing other things but i can t get too mad he s wanting to read history ! my youngest son rd grade just started reading this story world book for himself and he shows the same enthusiasm i think this book and others in the series are excellent for all ages to learn and develop a love of history i am enjoying them now myself and maybe my knowledge will eventually catch up to what my kids have learned a great choice i say to a fantastic writer and educator thanks to susan bauer for writing these books and sparking a great love and new hobby in our family jean in ohi 
read before you visit the park to begin with i don t agree with game hunting at all however if you re planning on visiting jim corbett park in uttaranchal pradesh india i d strongly recommend reading this book before you go the park is beautiful but knowing some of the history and the insights into tiger behaviour that corbett provides is fascinating 
christmas present thanks to the da vinci code and the rule of four my daughter in law has developed a taste for the italian masters this is a big heavy book with great full color reproductions and the bios of the artisis 
great book great author i don t think dv knows how to write a dud book in his typical style this book is a great source for all things induction related this book is great for someone who has little knowledge on the subject as it clearly explains all the fundamentals it is also just as valuable for the more experienced engine builder racer as it contains loads of info on carb mods manifold design and mods mixtures atomization etc it also dispells many myths that do nothing except slow you down rather than writing books based on popular and expert opinions dv s books are based on hard scientific fact he does the work and he has the results knowledge is horsepower ! with dv s books i ve never gone wrong on a horsepower per dollar basis his books are the best investment you ll ever make

the most powerful indictment of th century capitalism in existence friedrich engels classic the condition of the working class in england was written when he was only twenty four and had but recently abandoned his calvinist upbringing for a more critical socialist point of view yet this book reads as if it were written by an experienced political commentator or a radical sociologist without actually at any point becoming melodramatic or dense engels main purpose is to confront the bourgeoisie with the reality of their mode of production and to contrast this with the rhetoric of free choice and civil liberties as well as the capitalist apologia of the political economists of his day in particular andrew ure with great insight into both the causes and effects of the capitalist system engels catalogues the endless want filth despair and misery experienced by millions of labourers every day in th century england he pays attention to housing to factory safety to unionism to the physical condition of the workers to alcoholism the state of the irish underclass to prostitution and disease in short all the ills attendant on industrialization what gives this book such power is that engels on the one hand proceeds in an analytical manner making use above all of sources from the bourgeoisie itself and from parliamentary reports in explaining the functioning of the capitalist system and the competition between capitalists and between labourers on the other hand he writes in a particularly readable manner and at no point bores the reader with the mere summing up of statistics on the contrary every analytical truth is accompanied by a vivid description taken from engels excursions into working class neighbourhoods of the terrible state of humanity that the economic laws of capitalism cause for a great number of people for those interested in political economy it may come as a surprise to see how much of the functioning of capitalism engels already understood at such an early point in the development of theory this gives the lie to the many theorists who would later claim that it was marx only who worked on economics and that engels was a mere epigone this book should be a vindication of engels his later sketches of the political economy and of the historical development of capitalism would lay the foundation for both the communist manifesto and marx economic works but the core insights that would create the modern theory of socialism are for the first time fully expressed here and in a most appealing and shockingly effective manner in other words an absolute must read for every person of intelligence

a god send though i ve seen dr colbert on pastor hagee and joyce meyer shows i really wasn t completly convinced he knew what he was talking about i was completely prepared to dismiss him as quackery and the fringe element of the christian right until i actually bought what would jesus eat and found out that everything he said was true eating more vegetables does make you feel full longerthe bible cure for weight loss and muscle gain is even better being an endomorph with a slow metabolysm my weight plateud for two years straight it was when i read his book and bought the vitamins that he suggested the weight started comming off again taking a supplement of vitamins and minerals he suggested has gon a long way to nurrishing my body and ceasing the intense cravings i was experiencing for carbohydrates colbert also points out how the body works and why sugars and starchs actually prevent weight loss the example he gives of a woman who ate healthy but still couldn t loose weight because she was sucking on breath mints all day was mind blowing once she stopped the weight began to come off it s amazing how something seeming so small can interfere with your wieght loss goals you don t have to be a christian or particularly relgious to get what dr colbert suggests his medical advice is spot on there are a ton of diet books out there but i find that this one is the most simple and effective you owe yourself or someone you know who is struggling with the battle of the bulge to get this book it will help you or even save your life

get it in writing as judge judy points out to her audience there are no courts that protect couples living together people who decide to live together need to set up a legal contract when things fall apart the last thing needed is the distress and lawsuits that don t have any validity of who or what is owed in a society that pushes marriage on men and women it s refreshing to know that there are people who choose to be happy with an alternative lifestyle when the marriage falters couples have to seek legal assistance to end their marriage and divorce drags on for years because the courts fuel the fire which drains both parties emotionally and financially and children are caught in this mudslinging perhaps an alternative to marriage may change the divorce laws in this country

snobs an utterly gobsmacking read as soon as i read a review for this book i knew i would love it and it was immediately added to my amazon wish list i have always been partial to anything films tv shows or books that come out of the united kingdom great expectations was in my th grade english literature book i stayed up and read the entire book in one sitting i think it was then that i became an anglophile and if you love all things british i know you will adore this wonderful novel by julian fellowes i remember reading an interview in the book section of our sunday paper with julian fellowes regarding this book and his photograph had me absolutely befuddled because his face was so familiar yet i could not place him once i bought the book it was on the jacket he played lord kilwillie in my beloved the bbc television series monarch of the glen i also learned that in fellowes won a coveted oscar for his screenplay for robert altman s gosford park he also wrote the screenplay for vanity fair starring reese witherspoon among many other endeavors all four of the above wonderful projects that fellowes is associated with have the same underlying theme the clever and beautifully realized dissection of the english class system snobs is the story told by an actor who is very much like fellowes he develops a friendship with the beautiful edith lavery a beautiful twenty seven year old debutante the daughter of a wealthy businessman and his social climbing wife edith is pragmatic enough to know that she must marry into wealth hopefully titled in order to maintain the lifestyle of her dreams and she also didn t want to work ! she snags the wealthy kind and dull lord charles broughton who even lives in a castle she eventually becomes bored with her new life and escapes with a handsome and charming actor only to discover that there are worse things than being bored snobs is a fantastic book and fellowes is a brilliant author he perfectly describes both the obvious and subtle idiosyncrasies of the british aristocracy this is because he is a member of both classes julian fellowes was the son of a diplomat and had relatives who were titled educated at cambridge he spent time with the upper crust and as an actor with the hoi poli he is also an exceptional observer of british social classes other reviewers have categorized this as a beach book but i beg to differ although a great fun read this book with it s many four and above syllable words and a few words that i have never heard of but was too lazy to go look it up in the dictionary does require a modicum of concentration but every word is absolutely worth it 
goes great with little people nativity scene i bought this book for my month old last christmas she enjoyed listening to the rhymes and even learned to say baby jesus because of it this year we bought her the little people nativity scene and the book seems like it was made to go with it almost all the characters in the nativity scene are in the book and even look similar it really helped her understand that christmas is not just about santa and presents great story and message 
not to be ignored this book is a tiny slice of genius it can t be judged by a descriptive birthing scene in the first chapter or the descriptive climax toward the end what it should be judged by is the wonderful writing the spot on capture of dialect what it s like to live on a farm under rules that seem foreign to us but that are explained through prose rather than preaching we are allowed to see a young boy growing into a man and the responsibilities he accepts at such a young age are remarkable today s children could take a lesson from year old robert peck less video games less television more hard work reading and learning is included here not just farm work we see a masterfully written relationship between a son who loves his father and while his father is not a great man as many would measure him his son wants to grow up to be just like him because he sees greatness in his father any attentive reader should see the same readers may not agree with the strictness applied by the father but the man is loving and caring and intent on teaching his son how to be a man and how to act properly one review said that this was like sipping hot cider in front of a crackling potbellied stove and that felt true it s a rare experience to be allowed a glimpse into another way of life and have it done so masterfully with regard to the graphic nature of the novel it wasn t graphic it was descriptive anyone that s read james herriot s books all things great and small etc understands this that s what happened here if the description in the first chapter of rob s assistance in birthing the two cows was the only place such description was used then it could be considered gratuitous but it wasn t the author was meticulous in his detail even for the most mundane things like creating a tool to help their ox create a pen for rob s new pig pinky its understandable that some parents might not find some of the scenes in the book suitable for their children but that is their opinion they can police books for their children all they want and of course attempt to do so here but a review shouldn t be about policing it should be a fair assessment of the work how this book could make young adults lives more miserable than they already are because this presupposes that young adults lives are already miserable a theorem far too broad to prove is beyond me there is much good in this book to ignore it because of a gory detail or two would be a shame andthis gets high marks for one of the best titles i ve seen in a long time not only provocative and nearly impossible to miss while browsing through bookshelves at your local bookstore or library but absolutely perfectly suited to the book 
complex and involving this is one of a series of books which features dr alex delaware a young handsome and wealthy psychologist at a rather ritzy party he meets sharon an incredibly beautiful young psychologist with whom he had a brief fling some years previously drawn to her despite many misgivings he is caught up in a web of lies deceit and intrigue which culminate in several gruesome murders the plot involves a now deceased but sinister mega millionaire who is a direct copy of howard hughes complete with matted beard long filthy fingernails and all of his unattractive anal retention habits the story becomes more and more involved using identical triplet sisters mentally retarded carers and a svengali like therapist who controls sharon at times i was muttering hurry up and get on with it but in all an entertaining read

a great translation jesse byock s translation of the vlsungasaga manages to be both faithful and readable not as common a combination as you might think and it strikes a nice balance in its use of only the most important footnotes a little more than over the course of the saga these are usually etymological onomastic in nature which was very much to my liking i would have preferred them to be actual footnotes rather than end notes actually but that s just a quibble about having to flip back and forth while reading not a big problem really the slim volume also packs a great deal of essential historical context into a small but excellent introduction there s also a nice glossary of most of the proper nouns and this connects the anglicized spelling with the original old norse forms which can be helpful for those readers unfamiliar with the orthography a great edition of an old norse classic

emotions plus a desire to interact plus evolution language when asked to cite what he believed but couldn t prove dan dennett responded by saying that language was required for consciousness interestingly dennett s view easily harmonizes with strong trends in contemporary wisdom the larger view is that there is something particular and special about humans and their capacity for language that is materially different than what evolutionarily has preceded them this book is a breath of fresh air for its helpful insight that humans are not materially different from what preceded them just more articulated in their thought processes and means of communicating them in seriatim the book traces infant development for the capacity of spoken language and compares that developing capacity with different species of animals within the animal kingdom in a way it s kind of reminiscent of the old medical school ontogeny recapitulates philogeny for those lucky enough not to have experienced medical school the famous saying refers to the similarity between developmental stages of an unborn fetus and the various lifeforms in the animal kingdom for example the fertilized zygote resembles a one celled organism the early developing fetus resembles a fishlike creature and so on in this book needless to say the more articulated the comparison being made between the infant s developing speech capacity the more the authors will be inclined to use a more evolutionarily complicated life form significantly the authors use the similarities between humans and other animals to highlight their basic likenesses which according to the authors subsist in their mutual emotive acquisition of knowledge in this sense this book is like read montague s why choose this book wherein montague merged alan turing mechanistic reasoning with emotive values to create an up to date model of cognition again these features are all welcome where i think the authors falter is later in the book when they try to apply their theories to group dynamics but even so the book remains healthy food for thought and welcome insight if only for the knowledge that when we visit the zoo the animals looking back at us are really not that much different at all but certainly not lacking consciousness just because they don t speak out language 
great book amy timberlake s dirty cowboy is now my favorite picture book i have started using this as a read aloud for my students at school and they love the illustrations the cowboy goes to take his yearly bath at the creek only to find that once he is super clean his dawg no longer recognizes him it is a humorous tale as the cowboy and dawg fight for the clothing

cogent rundown on why the economy matters to you personally in this brief cogent book author tim harford provides an accessible entertaining introduction to economic thinking this deftly written report belongs on the shelf of anyone with an interest in economic matters and as the author makes clear everyone has an interest in economic matters he deftly punctures the balloons of those who advocate fair trade coffee protectionism government underwritten medical care and other such policies these tactics may seem humane on the surface but he contends that they often merely advance the selfish goals of the few at the expense of the many if the book has a weakness it is harford s tendency to take certain points of political opinion for granted and to state them as moral choices without qualification or proof for instance he puts forth the admirable though some would say questionable notion that governments are obliged to cushion the shock of unemployment that however is a quibble we highly recommend this concise comprehensive book 
a king fantasy novel this was the first king novel i ever read as a child and i was hooked although not typical of king s haunted cars or clarvoyant teens king is most seen in his character flagg the evil magician without giving anything away if king isn t your favorite author although he is mine this is a refreshing novel that first proved that he can write using other genres rather than his horror novels although king has been more apt recently to write other things this book was the first that was not so horrific it is even a great read for a pre teen or teen that isn t usually allowed to read king given that the book is much like the popular wizard novels of this decade

good book for learning asp net basics if you are new to asp net or have little to no programming experience this is a good book to start with it will teach you the basics of asp net vb no c here and some basic programming constructs there are some errors in the book which is why i did not give it stars one example of an error is on page dealing with a hyperlinkfield and the datanavigateurlformatstring this is something that apparently changed from the beta version the book was written with and the final release you need to convert this to template for it to work correctly the book also touches on web parts but the code did not work no errors just didn t work if you know some programming and want to get beyond the dummies i d recommend asp net in hours by scott mitchell a very good book without the smarminess that comes with the dummies titles 
stylish social history this was such a pleasant historical read i m very interested in all things stylish if not fashionable this title interested me at once it really describes how so many things we use today date back to the era of louis xiv today s obsession with luxury goods really has its roots in france s history louis xiv wanted every aspect of his life including those around him to be luxurious today many middle class and sometimes lower class working person thinks they deserve a louis vuitton bag or lexus suv living in style is a privilege but can be obtained with some creative thinking and budgeting just as long as we have our priorities straight 
powerful little book this book is basic small and simple but it packs a very powerful punch copan has a way of writing that cuts to the chase the whole book is designed to first presenting common quotslogansquot or misconceptions about certain things ie all truth is relative and then copan systematically deflates each misconception or falsity the thing i think i like most about the book is its simplicity when i say simplicity i don t mean unintelligent i mean copan can take fairly complicated ideas and make them easily understood that takes talent thus this book will enjoy a wide variety of readers moreover copan for such a brief work covers a lot of material copan discusses things such as the absolute nature of truth moral relativism exclusivity and religious pluralism the person jesus and the reliability of the gospels this is a very handy quotready reference quot work for those who have found themselves wondering quothow can i respond to that objection or comment quot 
ann martin s inside out before babysitters club i came across the baby sitters club the secret of susan that book is about a neighborhood girl with autism who goes to a special school the author of that series ann martin mentioned at the back of the book that she had some personal experience with autistic kids and this is how she was able to discuss the topic in a book it was also noted that before she created the baby sitters club series she wrote an earlier book entitled inside out also on the subject of a child with autism inside out is written in the third person via an eleven year old boy named jonathan he has a younger brother james who at four years of age has autism and keeps the family up nightly with his screaming lizzie is the other sibling at eight years of age there are nineteen chapters covering pages for young readers and those adults interested in learning how autism affects an older sibling along with his friends on a daily basis comparing the two books by this same author i felt more connected with the characters in inside out i preferred the writing style and felt it was an easier read i was interested in the activities jonathan and his friends pursued the relationships between siblings and parents and how everyone handled their stress it was very enlightening as a parent to boys to learn about behaviors and coping mechanisms things i can relate to more than the other book centering on girls who offer babysitting services a shopping trip with james was a nightmare and they tried to have someone home watching him so no one had to endure a scene once when jonathan came home from school his mother was crying after such a trip there are conversations between lizzie and jonathan about their parents and they assume that their dad works late so he can avoid james they clean the house and prepare dinner often so their mom can take a nap after a rough night being up with james they always talk about james in front of him as if he were not there there are times that james acts like a wild animal and scares the family inside out shows the compassion for another sibling and the bonds that are formed when the family takes part in the therapies and schooling of the special child this offers a glimpse into the family dynamics with an autistic child the characters were developed and realistic i felt happy reading about jonathan and his growing devotion toward james 
falstaff and richard ii s consolation prize in richard ii bolingbroke usurped richard ii s crown and became king henry iv in henry iv king henry iv stopped the rebellion by hostspur worcester and vernon but his enemy northumberland is still out there and this brings us to the present chapter henry iv despite the title the real star of this play is falstaff in henry iv falstaff had a moderate roll the learned isaac asimov was of the opinion that shakespeare got more than he bargained for with his falstaff and realized he could write a play with falstaff as the prominent character one minor complaint i have is that while falstaff probably could handle a play some of the scenes with him seem drawn out northumberland reappears and he is of course sad over the death of his son hotspur slain by prince henry in part we also meet the arch bishop of york who becomes an enemy of henry iv the arch bishop delivers a striking passage that emphasizes that the past and to come always seem better than the present in act we quickly learn that falstaff has built up some debts and that he is neglecting his duties to the king big surprise prince henry is a backstage player for the early part of the play but rather than being close to falstaff as in part he bitterly rebukes falstaff for his style of life also prince henry expresses some sorrow over his father s failing health but he is afraid he will be seen as a hypocrite if he shows it many people in his position wouldn t be able to wait to wear the crown interestingly a woman named doll begins to find falstaff attractive king henry iv does not enter until act and we can see that the rebellions have taken their toll on him he is having insomnia and he can only talk about the tribulations of his crown it is even possible that he feels he deserves his afflictions later falstaff gathers his men together in a well drawn comical scene westmoreland and henry iv s son lancaster defeat the rebellion of the arch bishop of york mowbray and hastings in a less than honorable way but this is not an invention of shakespeare it really happened in the comical coleville surrenders to our favorite fat rogue falstaff it is on the funny side when falstaff comments that lancaster is so uptight because he doesn t drink but the sad part of the play returns soon enough despite the fact that henry iv s enemies have been defeated henry iv s health has failed and he doesn t have much more of a reign to enjoy and if you follow my reviews this constitutes a small consolation prize to king richard ii the scene where king henry iv admits his crimes begs god s forgiveness and wishes the eventual henry v well is one of shakespeare s greatest moments i always liked how in richard ii henry iv was a young and energetic usurper and then in henry iv he was portrayed as somewhat more heroic and a likable king and in henry iv he was portrayed as a sorrowful and penitent man some people dislike henry v for banishing falstaff but the truth is henry v has little choice falstaff s actions as comical and entertaining as they are are flat out criminal though shakespeare did not keep the epilogue s word by putting falstaff in henry v he would eventually reappear in the merry wives of windsor 
a strangely good group of stories first off the title of this book is a little misleading dark delicacies is not a trip into fantastic eroticism vampiric tales of obscene delight or anything in the vein of goth this book carries the name of a book shop nothing more that is known for carrying only horror books and other such things dealing with the occult with del howison as the proprietor of this shop as well as co editor of this book after i learned as much i found myself diving deep into the terror tales in this book and no book in recent years has opened up as good as this ray bradbury s tale is an intricate circling story that really introduces what can be expected from the other tales in this book what is great about this book is that it covers all ranges of horror from the hack andslash to the psychological and most of them are successful in there attempts to elicit a chill and along with ray bradbury there are quite a few high powered writers contributing their talent to this book including clive barker chelsea quinn yarbro ramsey campbell nancy holder and richard matheson and those are the ones i ve heard of before while i hesitate to say what some of the stories are about i will say that of the tales ive read i was only disappointed maybe twice not once did i feel exploited though which is something very important to me when i read horror these stories are smart as well as scary because of that reason i have to recommend this book above all other short story collections this year that relates to horror or dark fantasy often i pick up a best of collection and realize that only four or five of the tales actually appeal to my tastes not with this one if you love old fashioned horror written by some of the fields masters then get dark delicacies 
book of jubilees the book of jubilees is a interesting read because it is a book that many new testament authors were familiar with and perhaps influenced by the book tells the entire old testament over again from the perspective of the authors of the time helenistic jews and includes many elements not mentioned in the actual bible or not elaborated on extensively in the actual bible the book relies heavily upon the work known as the book of enoch which also had heavy influence on the authors of the new testament particularly the authors of revelation and jude if you want to understand the jewish thought of the time of jesus this is a great book to read 
refreshing hype free reality therapy a life saver this book breaks away from the pack by combining practical hype free admissions advice with a refreshing dose of reality therapy in addition to soup tonuts application guidance the book offers parents advice for preventing the college admissions process from straining our relationship with our kids i strongly suggest reading this book with your college bound daughter or son the author wisely cites studies showing that a good parent child relationship is a far greater predictor of academic and life success than sat scores or selective college acceptance ! thank you i needed that 
an exciting new view of elementary particles i enjoyed this book because it developed an exciting new approach to quantum field theory that appears to solve the divergence issues that have plagued quantum field theory since its inception the method proposed brings in new quantum dimensions that are only evident at super high energies the usual standard model of elementary particles and classical gravity are the quotlow energy quot sector the book is written in textbook style with a thorough description of the features of this new type of qft however the reader is assumed to have some knowledge of quantum field theory although i was concerned about the integrals over quantum operators that appear in the development the fact that the author developed the theory using both a canonical quantization approach and a path integral approach convinced me of its correctness even the fadeev popov ghosts fell within the framework of the approach ! a thoroughly enjoyable book that presents exciting original results 
warm and comforting hug your dog do you have a passion for animals if so you ll inhale this book the authors heartfelt emotions can be felt on every page he clearly adored the animals he cared for over the decades he described the colorful european countryside the diverse pets and the people who owned them in fine detail each story is accompanied by an ink sketch that added some warm visuals my favorite stories were of tricki woo judy the nurse dog granville bennett and cigar what was nice is that since the stories were broken up you could not lose your place when you took a break yet i only took one because this was a fast page turner i have had several dogs in my life and these are the most honest depictions of dog behavior i have read thus far all animal lovers will enjoy this time to hug my dog and adopt another

how so much could go wrong the title of this book refers to the congo river of africa this great river became famous in western minds in the s with the journeys of dr livingstone later it would be the setting of the heart of darkness doctors and scientists in the heart of darkness indeed as the river explains in its long well documented exhaustive tale of secretive unregulated medical research this book s author interviews hundreds of individuals involved in this process goes over countless documents and from it pieces together the following story after wwii there was a race to find a vaccine for polio that could be administered orally numerous groups of scientists from around the world took part in this race the prize being fame fortune and patents galore in public these teams agreed to perform all their research in western countries document everything and only conduct tests on adults who had signed written consent forms in reality many of these teams flocked to the africa congo to perform large scale tests on unwitting and unknowing human populations often without oversight by the press or medical institutions these groups would inject various african primates with polio extract serum from the infected primates and using this serum to make experimental vaccines which would then be given to the local human populations this book contends that by this process hiv was accidentally transmitted from certain monkeys into humans the author provides numerous pieces of evidence in proof of this theory first the very same villages in the congo where hiv was first discovered also happened to be the very same villages in which the polio tests were performed second hiv was diagnosed in these villages years after the polio tests were performed third none of the other currently existing theories can explain how a primate virus passed into the human population and spread so quickly over a period of decades given that the two populations of monkeys and humans had coexisted in the same habitat since the dawn of man without any such transmission fourth during public hearings in the s the various teams presented their oral vaccines to the world scientific community one team found an unknown immunodeficiency virus in one of the samples provided by another team hmmm an unknown immunodeficiency virus sounds like hiv to me fifth the scientists that conducted these trials in the congo are unwilling to release their samples and scientific data for public scrutiny even though all the patents and honors have already been distributed overall this is a very good book even if you do not believe the author s theory i still highly recommend it for the author covers a lot of aspects of the medical field that one might not necessarily learn in school or in the newspapers these include making and testing vaccines animal testing human testing obtaining funding for medical research scientific protocol relationships between the medical community and governments medical reporting competition in the medical community statistical sampling and epidimiology

it s a favorite this is one of my very favorite garden books pictures are beautiful and the book is informative giving plant names and even showing layout drawings of how the plants were placed the gardens were not designed by professionals but were created thru trial and error the way most people do their own shows how pretty a garden can be without perfection even shows many tiny doorway gardens that should not be intimidating for busy american gardeners i would highly recommend this book

quite useful this is not a textbook and not intended to be one it is a collection of board type questions with lenghty explanations i found it quite useful to test myself months before i took the boards to discover my strenghts and weaknesses there are many spelling mistakes and some inconsistencies so it certainly would not hurt if the authors could review their book once more 
bridge to the sun this is the touching true story of an american woman who gets deported with her japanese husband and their daughter to japan after the attack on pearl harbor i enjoyed this story because it gave a very human account of the tragic time in which the story is set and the very good and kind people on both sides of the pacific during those terrible years it is also the story of two people s love and devotion to eachother which overcomes the difference in culture and race i recommend it i saw the movie which was loosely based on this story many years ago but have been unable to find a copy

the optimal viral fighter material in this book convinced me to try the substance researching a list of manufacturers in the back of the book i selected ameriden they had done a lot of research and subsequently settled on a product that had a stablized level of olive leaf extract this means it didn t quotbreak down quot over a short period of time while in the bottle one case bottles later i seem to be symptom free note i took capsule mg four times a day a case of bottles lasted about months

good barry some recycled material excellent book definitely recommended only one complaint there is some recycled material in the book by recycled material i mean text that was taken out of columns written on the subject at hand and inserted into the book with at most only minor modifications this is minimal though and the book is almost completely new material 
very handy review grammar this is a thorough review of intermediate italian grammar the material is presented in tabular form for quick review but is more comprehensive and detailed than the format would first suggest also signora de rome includes numerous subtleties not found in standard american beginning and intermediate italian texts which have been considerably dumbed down in recent years i had to study in italy for a while to learn some of this stuff wish i d had soluzioni then 
i lt literarture class i bet bucks that half of the class is going to cut and paste one of these reviews i probably will to ps i here that this is a pretty good book read it or else 
this book has helped me i have been able to really learn a great deal about how others in my life affect my relationship i also have been able to put into words what i was feeling my husband read it but felt it was just too conservative and didn t really support all the reasons to stay married but it did get us talking it made me feel i wasn t crazy to try to stay married and that for anyone to consider a divorce without truly trying to work things out is a big cop out 
like reading a soap opera from another era this was a lightning quick read there is not much particularly challenging about this novel but it was a lot of fun maupin successfully evokes a very specific time and place s san francisco and interweaves multiple storylines some important social issues homosexuality is a big one are dealt with in a non judgmental and entertaining way tales of the city features several characters who rent apartments at barbary lane from one anna madrigal a mysterious woman in her fifties who has a sketchy past mary ann singleton fulfills the role of naive midwestern newcomer who falls in love with sf while vacationing and decides to relocate only to have significant trouble adjusting to the completely different social mores of her new home there are of course many other characters each with their own storylines i am looking forward to reading the next installment of the series 
reflections in a golden eye review the main character in this story is private ellgae williams it is set in an army post private ellgae williams is a shy but determined young man he is very dedicated to the army and his assigned work even when not on duty the private likes to hang around the post the antagonists in this story are captain penderton and his wife captain penderton is a very hostile man he comes off as a strong man but in reality he is very weak he is a coward in many ways he never stood up for himself especially to his wife mrs penderton isn t a modest person at all she is the strong person in the family and takes advantage of that in every way she is the kind of person that runs around on her spouse and doesn t even think twice about it carson mccullers used flashbacks in this book as well as metaphors she portrayed real problems that happen in real life mccullers did a very good job on this piece of work the way she described the characters i could picture each one vividly mccullers did a very good job at proving that the world was not only all about the american dream and the people s goals toward that but also the ones that rebelled and were not afraid to do the unusual if you like books with twists and turns from the usual plots then you will enjoy this book as much as i did 
the skinny on hiassin were someone to write a biography of carl hiassin in fifty years it is hard to imagine that he or she wouldn t focus on the author s latest triumph skinny dip it is one of his seminal achievements the book simply shines with humor well drawn characters action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts it is also one of his smoothest rides one gets the feeling that hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote here is an overview that will stimulate readers interest hiassin s the book opens with chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship but by some twists and turns and luck joey survives long enough to be rescued much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as joey and her team pursue vengeance by the midpoint of the novel chaz is already an emotional wreck and it doesn t look like joey is about to let up any time soon the moral backbone of the novel is twofold one is the pitting of the everglades forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants the everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business hiassin s two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book but also lends it a feeling of seriousness and two is the pitting of criminals against victims who aren t going to take it anymore hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to joey as most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to one s helplessness there are six main characters in the book joey and her horny husband chaz joey s rescuer mick who is a kind and eccentric ex policeman who lives alone on an island joey s brother a rich expatriate who raises sheep in new zealand mr hammernut the owner of a large agricultural empire and tool the books muscled goon who undergoes a moral transformation the small group of sub characters is entertainingly populated in part with a hermit who lives in the swamp a street tough hairdresser a slap happy senior and a cowardly lawyer though similar elements live in many of hiassin s works his books never feel like he has used a formula to create them more easily this can t be said for all or most of crime writers and should be accredited to hiassin s love for storytelling his skill as a plot weaver and his ability to evoke so many different emotions in this line of thought this reviewer took note of the characters subtle except for tool character changes throughout the book joey for example seemed learn a bit more restraint as she calmed down a little and the same can be said even for characters that have appeared in some of hiassin s previous works mickhiassin has never been a fan of superficial materialism but the issue is slightly complicated by skinny dip and does not simply fall into place along character axes while the villains all crave money some of the heroes are loaded too joey maintains a very frugal existence considering her million trust but her brother spends lavishly joey s rescuer on the other hand lives on a disability check one may wonder if the only difference between chaz and his wife is that she never had to work or hustle for a buck but there is one other way in which the enemies contrast and that is the way they treat their associates chaz is continuously scrambling for something and in his desperation be it for sex money or escape uses other people as tools rather than relating to them as equals on the other hand joey has a good sense of humor and she enjoys the companionship of her pals like most of hiassin s work this book is not an overly violent one although it begins with an attempted murder the event is quite peaceful there is no struggle no blood and the victim joey does not die after reading skinny dip i immediately lent it to my best friend katie who has not been able to put it down so potential readers be warned like katie you may not be able to get any work done for a day or two but the time is not wasted on hiassin s best work to date one comes away gaining not only pleasant memories of laughs and smiles but also the feeling that one has poured one more drop into the bucket of our minds that we must fill in order to make this world a better place in short carl hiassin puts us in touch with the good guys in ourselves

the greatest charles dickens humanist brilliant writer of prose creator of astonishingly endurng characters and creator of david copperfield copperfield is dickens masterpiece and it is his semi autobiographical approach which makes the work doubly fascinating the similarities between copperfield and the historical dickens which are numerous add a potency and extra interest to the narrative still it is the wonderful likeability and absurdity of so many of the characters in dc which really make the story barkiss peggotty ham and agnes are wonderfully virtuous and kind if uncomplicated in their different ways heap and steerforth who share in common their eventual villainy are by no coinicidence contrastingly complex unfathomable throughout and misguided however the problems of simplicity are evident in dora dickens acknowledges limits to the virtuosity of simplicity her downfall is nevertheless tragic but we know it is in the interests of david s long term happiness to marry agnes dickens achievement in the book is his profound sympathy for the human condition there is virtue in every rank but virtue takes many forms moreover dickens shows how inextricably he perceives one s life as constructed around the lives and fortunes of those one encounters in youth it is striking that copperfield s life is essentially determined by those he encounters in his formative years the most important and complex role and character is that of his aunt almost an eccentric fairytale godmother character whose contibution almost suggests her metaphysical condition as a kind of guiding light she rescues david and looks after him when noone else will the tenuous conditions upon which humans succeed and fail are clear because of her role the book is memorable complicated and profound it immortalised dickens himself as well as his characters

a cheater exposed if you are still blindly defending barry bonds at this point you really should have your head examined or at least your g ed rescinded barry bonds never failed a drug test might be the most idiotic phrase uttered since walkoff home run or maybe free o j it s time to pull your heads out of you knowwhere people the guy put on pounds of muscle during one off season you don t do this with a soloflex and flaxseed oil think these trainers don t know their way around a urine test pull the other one when news of the imminent publication of this book was revealed bonds and his lawyers didn t waste any time trying to suppress its release hey barry if you re clean then what s the problem if this book is fabrication then stick it out eventually the truth will be revealed and therein lies the problem for mr bonds because it already has if you still have any doubts about this book let me dispel them read it it s thoroughly researched well written and most of all important it had to be written because this situation had to be exposed i must say that i was stunned but very pleased that there were actually two men in san francisco with the guts to investigate bonds let alone put their findings in print this took great courage because i wouldn t be surprised if these guys received death threats from knuckle dragging fans i wish i could shake their hands and thank them personally for their efforts to put it bluntly barry bonds is a cheater a disgrace to the legacy of the great men who have played major league baseball and a miserable human being for good measure he should receive nothing less than a lifetime ban from baseball and all of his post numbers should be expunged from the books or at the very least printed in a bright red with this disclaimer these statistics were achieved during what is known as the steroid era in mlb and are not legitimate mr bonds has received a lifetime suspension the same treatment should be extended to mcgwire sosa giambi palmiero etc if you want to throw the likes of gaylord perry and mike scott in there be my guest although to me vaseline and sharpened belt buckles don t rise to the level of potent chemical enhancements anyone who reads this book with even the most elemental reading comprehension will come to the same conclusion or perhaps bonds s shrinking numbers this year will be enough to convince you 
enjoyed seeing familiar characters this may not have been her best novel but i thoroughly enjoyed it it was nice to see some of the characters from her previous novels in new adventures if i hadn t read some of them i might have been lost with the rem plot line 
of living in interesting times baudolino starts the book distressed his right road lost he has killed a man a long time friend which is against his own morals that permit lying but forbid killing he ends up describing this event as well as his life s story to a historian master niketas his virgil or shrink looking to make sense of his whole life a book later niketas living up to the maxim its not what you know it s whom you know brings a blind wise man paphnutius who can see right through baudolino s stories solves the mystery of another murder and to baudolino s shock points out that it was baudolino himself who inadvertently killed another man his adopted father frederick the holy roman emperor horrified baudoloino then does some soul searching finds god inside and made whole with this knowledge goes back into the world to settle some old debts this is a nice wrapper around the chronicle of baudolino s life blended with historic events myths and religion in the s the kernel plot is quite engaging especially since history is often more striking when served as a little bit of spice to somebody s personal story history and baudolino s biography are always vying for the primary spot baudolino spends most of the book working towards frederick s glory and with it the glory of a great european empire it is baudolino the pragmatic visionary who suggests to frederick the idea of independent universities and with them the idea of the freedom of thought and it is he again who works on having frederick s rule recognized by the pope a fake letter from prester john and a fake holy grail notwithstanding perhaps baudolino embodies the author s own longing for a colorful and benevolent force working for the benefit of a greater and better europe in addition to giving baudolino the leading role in some of the most important events of his time eco endows him with all a man must know for a complete life poverty love and war o henrybaudolino is basically a mensch he may be somewhat of a schemer but he does not have an evil bone in his body it is perhaps a reflection of the author s belief in some general good that the history of the fairly rough and tumble s is shown as a commentary to such a man 
awesome map looks like a really good quality map that will be very useful for our in canyon backpacking trip 
good sequel some reservations shiloh season is the second book in the shiloh trilogy in this ongoing saga yearold marty must face some of the consequences of past decisions particularly the secret of how he managed to buy his beagle shiloh from judd travers his previous owner just when we thought marty s fears about shiloh s well being were over judd begins to drink heavily and is displaying erratic behavior which causes marty to once again fear for shiloh s safety as well as his own marty faces some difficult decisions again as well as showing maturity as he wrestles with needing to protect shiloh and wanting to find out if it s possible to teach kindness to someone who has never known it while this sequel was very enjoyable it somewhat lacked the page turning intensity of its predecessor in shiloh naylor deftly managed to make all the characters alive and a meaningful addition to the book but shiloh season didn t quite draw me in as well and the scenes with shiloh himself almost seem superfluous if you are a fan of marty and shiloh then you will most likely enjoy this next part of the story if you haven t read the first book i would highly recommend reading it first and become a fan before reading this second book positive elements though marty s willingness to take risks in reaching out to judd travers stem from his desire to keep shiloh safe he learns compassion in the process and then attempts to teach it to judd himself again this book demonstrates to us an excellent work ethic and devotion to family marty may not always know what the right thing to do is but his desire to do the right thing is refreshing negative elements as in the first book there are scenes which may frighten or disturb some children including the use of firearms one of the main themes of the book deals with abusing alcohol and i edited out some language as i read this book aloud to my children

the journey of man a genetic odyssey if you have ever questioned where adam and eve started and how planet earth was populated this is a must read doctor wells located the oldest africans he could find took blood samples then using his dna knowledge produced dna markers he continued this process around the world and by examining the dna markers he could determine the path of primitive people and where they started he produced a readable technical book that leaves the lay person with a clear understanding of where we started and where and when the first adam and eve left the trees and stood up on two feet 
i feel better about myself and my life joan borysenko is a class act ! in this inspiring discussion of various ways to connect with one s own sense of the divine she so gracefully finds the common ground shared by different approaches to spirituality that it s hard to believe that disagreements about religion are at the heart of so many troubles in the world today if only more people would listen to this program i consider myself fairly well traveled seeker in the spiritual realm but i learned a lot about myself and my husband when we played it in the car on a long drive although the program is six cds long for less than listening to it took up even more driving time because we kept pausing the cd to discuss the points she was making that s my idea of a good audio program !

you bring out the elvis in me elvis in jerusalem is less about the americanization of israeli society than it is about the dezionization of israeli culture segev one of the foremost israeli new historians ie revisionists sees the liberation of israel from its drab early khaki colored socialist collective pioneer culture as necessarily a good thing and treats the resultant influx of american products values norms and even language as an amicable step toward globalization and israeli normalization segev is correct to an extent the severe and essentially narrow views of israel s founders have fallen further and further out of step as the state of israel has matured as early zionist philosophies have withered pluralism has flourished where ben gurion and his fellows wanted to create a socialist new hebrew human being and a parochially secular yet all jewish state out of the disparate elements of european oriental and new world jewry israel today embraces a diversity of practices and has re embraced yiddish and ladino culture as well as that of jews from other lands as the state has grown politico emotionally there has been an increasing tendency to treat with the resident arabs israeli arabs and palestinians both on a more evenhanded basis this is all to the good segev addresses but of course cannot resolve the inherent contradictions of living in a democratic secular state in which jewish clergy or zionist philosophers control certain key social structures these contradictions affect all israelis no matter their ethnicity or faith and create the dynamic tensions which drive israeli society forward or back depending on one s views segev views the american model as key he revels in an open pluralistic multicultural society but seems too close to the issue to see that these elements can also cause profound social schisms as they do in the u s he never acknowledges the walmartization of this consumer culture the substitution of instant gratification and cheap junk for quality and bedrock values as in the least destructive segev seems to view most israeli schisms as overwhelmingly political palestine versus west bank for example or religious who is a jew rather than directly addressing the sea change in israel from pioneer culture to organization man culture which in effect is the same sea change that has altered the american social fabric segevs new history in which he questions and debunks the accepted institutional mythos of the re establishment of the jewish homeland is thought provoking it would have been better and stronger had segev bothered to document the majority of his statements and sources although elvis a melungeon of sephardic jewish descent has long since left the building segev provides the american reader with a view of an israel profoundly altered from the day of cast a giant shadow a modern vibrant complex and confused place full of living breathing human beings

murr on faced with impossible relativism falsehood the impossibly of truth what can our reaction be to laugh the ludic as an alternative to the despair of nihilism the discourse is hilarious and at key moments when the action is most intense and the characters are being most lead astray from their purposes they are overcome by a hilarity and a hysteria which incapacitates them and often the reader too read more from murr on the lectern 
katie s thoughts on a western hero i bought gene autry s book after seeing him on the tv show hee ha way back in the early s he was being interviewed by roy clark i believe and during this interview mr autry stated that he recently had published his auto biography back in the saddle again with the help of mikey herkowitz i was living in west plains mo at the time and i didn t have any idea of how to purchase his book so i wrote to gene in care of the california angels baseball team in anaheim california to ask him were i might find a copy of his book about weeks had past when i received a letter from mr autry and he had enclosed an autographed bookplate an x black and white picture of some of the angels baseball players some angels decals and a very nice letter from him on his golden west letterhead paper he was very nice and happy to know that he still had fans that were still interested in his career and will being i found out were i could order his book and did so and i read it immediately upon receiving it and of course put his autographed bookplate in it and i will charish it forever about his book it was very interesting informative and very humorous i enjoyed reading it very much so much so that my husband got very ercked with me because i didn t want to put it down i personally will miss gene autry very much his songs his acting and his personna on and off the wide screen will never be equaled by another the fact that he took the time out of his busy schedule to write to me and included an autographed bookplate which said personally autographed for catherine lebarron quot back in the saddle again quot is the story of my life i hope you enjoy reading it of course i did leave some parts out with very best wishes gene autr

another winner from a fantastic author julie and romeo get lucky by jeanne ray is the sequel to julie and romeo jeanne ray s writing is so spot on accurate sometimes i swear she must be recording people in their home and then simply transcribing it ! but she s so much funnier and sweeter than real life romeo throws out his back carrying julie up her stairs and ends up an invalid in her bed nora julie s oldest daughter is pregnant and on bed rest so she moves home too sarah julie s granddaughter is obsessed with willie wonka the chocolate factory and so the story goes from there julie can t grab a spare moment to herself when everything is falling apart ray has a unique talent for describing physical comedy that few writers can manage i found myself laughing and gasping out loud at poor romeo i wish life was as sweet as it is in ray s world and i treasure the moments i get to spend there read her other books as well they re all winners

timeless lyrics and beautiful illustrations take one look at this book and you will realize how much thought time and effort was put into its creation i read this book to my class of four and five yearolds on the last day of a unit in which we discussed america s landscape its folk music and what makes our country unique what better song to sum it all up than an american classic such as this they loved it ! i sang the verses to them and they joined in on the chorus i can t remember the last time a book captivated them the way this one did ! and to make things even better the cd comes with not one but nine songs performed by woody guthrie and arlo guthrie all of which are lively memorable and downright wonderful children s songs my students as well as the other teachers thoroughly enjoy the music this book and cd are an extremely valuable tool for the classroom as well as the home i couldn t be happier with my purchase and i would recommend it to anyone 
classic tale of moral centre lost and found lord jim has always been on my reading list since i was young i had read heart of darkness three times typhoon and the nigger and the narcissus i found the tales and conrad s abstract way of relating the exploits and thinking processes of simple people many or whom i could readily identify with resonating and profound for me the central tenet of this novel is about moral centre what it is to a man society where action springs from and how a person can loose such a thing and how ones gets it back jim s fall from grace could match any person from any walk of life who finds themselves in precarious circumstances where fate collides with free will and choice in such a case how much does one control and how much does fate decide if we believe jim s case it is not so clear cut at times sometimes people are forced despite their best intentions by events on a course of action that leaves the person reeling confused and depressed that they may have abandoned their moral wellspring even when sure they have not mane may be haunted by society thinking or judging harshly a person who has been judged as not living up to a certain presumed moral order it is easy to see that there were probably some lesser minions in the enron scandal some accountants who should have possibly known better but did not act there are actions of soldiers in combat who try to aim for the good but circumstances may force horrible decisions upon them dramatic examples are not really so necessary because part of the beauty of the book is that it forces common people such as myself to ask continually what would i do in such circumstances jim haunted by his loss retreats to the wilds of sumatra and establishes a new legacy in a part of the world that does not know his past but defines him in terms of his acts after he arrives it is a world of noble savage offerred redemption it is the comfort or loneliness and the profound strength in the personal knowledge that one has done right there is no confusing societal filter or ambiguous circumstance jim does not make a mistake twice he proves to society and most importantly to himself that he has recovered his moral centre for action one honest note for all readers i would not classify myself as an intellectual but i do have an abiding interest in just about everything dealing with the love of knowledge i do not read much contemporary fiction narratives and philosophy and science are more my thing so there is no reason why the abstruse style of conrad s writing should be off putting at times but it is ! and his switch between direct narration things he saw or said to indirect narration things other people told him and that he now relates can be a little hard to follow you often loose track of the narrative subject is he talking about jim another story teller relax for a second and you can at times loose the narrative completely and i defy any honest teacher of english literature to edeny this that is something that stops this yarn from being known to wider audiences but it must be admitted some of the reason is the tenor of the time it was written in but i have a lot of literature from the same age and none of it matches conrad s narrative style for beauty and abstruse description that is both the strength and the challenge of conrad s writing also if you are not familiar or interested in the lore of the sea or british maritime technology and history i am a fanatic then you may have a problem with this book this edition can be very helpful for you because there is a glossary and you can look up terms such as davit and belay pin and know the difference between a cutter and a barque in addition there are significant historical documents in the back of the book relating to the actual historical events surrounding this story yeah and literary reviews not so hot one should make an effort to master this text like most things in life worth doing it takes effort but yields rich results 
great stuff with wll blended theory and practical info i ve been itching to properly learn javascript for a while and had been doing so with the javascript bible that is one heavy book although a bit out dated now i finally came across this book and boy am i glad i did i ve learnt more concepts about javascripting practices than any other book or resources i ve referred to this book in my opinion is definitely for the non scripterprogrammer so if you re new to javascript this may not be the best choice for your first book however if you ve touched javascript for a while or have done some sort of programming or even actionscript in flash this will be quite an easy read its totally opened my eyes to creating sites that are no longer tagged with oh it s one of those javascript only sites again that try to be oh sofancy but break in other browsers if you want to take on the power of javascript but also be a caring friendly web designer this is definitely a book you should check out 
persuasive enough a perfect one sided story carefully equipped with opinions of heavy weighted thinkers elaborately designed to persuade but one sided nevertheless 
among the creme of the creme of business books this is one of the most insightful books i ve ever come across the author is simply a genious embracing the principles of this book may be the difference between developing a successful business or not 
a book that has been rejected despised and burned in india a book that has been rejected despised and burned in india the myth of the holy cow by d n jha dares to challenge the traditional hindu belief that the cow is a sacred animal the myth of the holy cow makes the controversial claim that beef was an important ingredient in the cuisine of ancient india long before the birth of islam and allowed in the brahmanist and buddhist diet a meticulously researched strongly worded persuasively articulated challenge to long held religious beliefs the myth of the holy cow is a unique and iconoclastic contribution to the study of hindu beliefs practices history and customs 
exceptional history and horsemanship this is one of the books that i actually took to college with me due to its unusual author xenophon wrote this work from the his viewpoint of a cavalry commander several thousand years ago even though the work is literally dated his knowledge has never ceased to be of interest to modern riders perhaps the first novel ever written on horsemanship it includes training troops choosing horses and putting on army displays although not the best choice for a person who desires a book to teach them to ride this book will be a delight for any horseperson desiring to learn about ancient cavalry practices and the origins of the horse in military settings 
awesome book if you re a rossi fan this book is just for you definitely different version from m oxley which is good too 
life is at your feet this is the life story of kim phuc with supporting coverage of the horrors of vietnam and the endless legacy of pain and sorrow caused by the war kim was captured on film in the devastating news photo form as she ran naked and screaming from a napalm attack which turned out to be a friendly fire accident to boot while reading this book i was unable to stop flipping it over to look at the famous photo on the cover again and again as writer denise chong does an outstanding job of bringing kim and her story to life granted the book does have a few weaknesses chong obviously saw the need to add background information about the war to support kim s story though in the attempt to summarize or introduce the issues and politics of the war chong s coverage seems simplistic and perfunctory also as kim s biography progresses chong is trying too hard and inconsistently to make the book inspirational with kim s inner thoughts and reflections on her ongoing struggles coming across as forced and sappy in places but these weaknesses do not damage the overall success of the book because kim s life story is definitely compelling and her postwar struggles are especially informative we learn about the wartime travails of kim s middle class vietnamese family culminating in the horrific day when she was injured and barely survived kim has suffered through chronic pain and constant health problems stemming from here severe napalm burns meanwhile the incompetent new communist regime in vietnam used her for years as a pawn in propaganda schemes and ruined her once successful family kim spent most of her teen and young adult years trying to escape the regime s clutches and finish her schooling and interestingly she observed the collapse of two communist systems both at home and as an exchange student in cuba she now lives as an activist in canada chong s coverage of the postwar hardships of those affected by the vietnam war is especially valuable because you see little of this type of material in standard war texts and you will surely root for kim phuc as she slowly puts her lifetime of horrors behind her doomsdayer 
christ doesn t change our understanding changes a book that will make you think not a bad thing for christians to do this book looks at our understanding of jesus and how it changes as we age as charles britt a very wise man once said all we as christians are asked to do is to commit what we understand of ourselves to what we understand of christ we will change as human beings and our concept and perception of christ will change thats what this book is about our changing concepts of jesus he doesn t change our understanding of him changes as we age and grow in life experience one important point this book while very good is for those who have already started the journey of thought and faith beginners might want to start with the jesus i never knew by philip yancey then come back to this book both are well worth reading this one is a little deeper deeper thought is required here the jesus i never knew is a better primer for this book yancey is a writer borg is a theologian both have their places 
a great psychic mystery others have given the plot of this book in their reviews and done it very well so i ll stick to giving my opinion of the book abby does a favor for a friend and ends up trapped by a mafia boss who pulls no punches in getting abby to work for him i found this book to be slightly darker than the first because the mob boss is one really bad dude all the characters that i love are here starting with abby herself ms laurie makes her such a real person and such a likable one that i wish i could meet her and her troop of friends especially eggy this is a great murder mystery and had plenty of psychic insight for those of us who love that sort of thing i loved this book and have read it twice so far like revisiting old friends i have also read book three and can t wait for to be released in sept read and enjoy 
very detailed this was the first lost book i ve ever purchased and i was not disappointed my personal favorite part was the summaries of the show s literary references really interesting stuff the amount of detail in this book is astounding anything you could ever hope to know about the first two seasons is in here r ip boone 
o rourke is masterful being an avid reader of o rourkes material i must say this book is one ofakind it is written in the style of oliver wendell holmes the autocrat of the breakfast table which was a brilliant collection of essays and observations of life as o rourke notes holmes pulled this off with so much wit and charm that there was only one way i could pay his idea the compliment it deserved i swiped it pj s own collection of essays features holmes like alter egos the political nut browbeating the democrat neighbors and frustrating o rourkes wife makes for some of the best one liners in the book and collections of o rourkes own superbly written essays from travels through india beware the customs officials to the u n millenium summit at the un they put butter on their bagels no wonder these people can t achieve peace in the middle east o rourkes own wit and charm somehow makes sense of senseless situations but please don t believe that this book is only for the ivory tower intellectual clique essays are included which feature everything from a drunken wine tasting test to helpful automotive tips use a lighter weight oil in the winter johnson s baby oil for instance rub this all over somebody cute stay home and forget about starting the car the book s politics will primarily delight republicans and irritate democrats although anyone who can laugh at political absurdity will find this a great read no matter what their personal political leanings o rourke dissects and flambes hillary clinton s book it takes a village he offers his own arbitration of the presidential debacle the topic of social security privatization is discussed an unintentionally relevant topic four years later and the last chapter of the book is rife with all the sardonic partisanship one would ever need to convulse on the floor with laughter in short this book covers a year s worth of topics and before you realize it you ve read the whole book in one sitting quite fitting from someone who describes the theme of his book as being one year in the life of a man who said mind if i put my feet up i think i will take this lying down 
examines jewish humor from every angle this is a very interesting and humorous book most of the greats that i am familiar with are represented here so you get a truly all encompassing across the board variety of wit it takes sources of from the written word plays film stand up comics word of mouth jokes through various periods of history it s all here or at least what can be held in one gigantic volume a must have 
great story great art i normally avoid the cosmic heavenhellangelsdemons stuff like the plague but the entire preacher series got such good reviews i bought the first one then the next one byone then the last four all at once this series never gets bogged down in the major cosmic whatnot that seems to be the norm for some series the characters are great the storyline is great and while the art isn t groundbreaking it fits extremely well for the story the only thing that would have made the series better is if the main character was joseph cohen and the series was titled rebbe rabbi everybody knows that yarmulkes and peyes are way cooler than a preacher s collar also the fact that people like kevin smith and penn jillette write the forewords of this series gives a good indication of what kind of audience would enjoy this fantastic stuff 
chicken soup for the mother and sons soul what an inspiring book it brought up many fond childhood memories i sent one to my mom today i can t wait to see her response 
strongly influenced my decision to quit drinking i am an alcoholic after reading this book i understood better why my body can t handle alcohol the way other s can that was one part that helped me to abstain even in the face of the intense cravings which i experienced in the beginning another very enlightening part of the book is the discussion of the influence of the alcohol industry on laws relating to the use and abuse of alcohol that angered me to the point where even if i want a drink really badly i don t want to support the industry ! this was a fascinating read and i recommend it for alcoholics and the people who love them 
compelling and well written this was an absolute intoxicating read i loved it from the first to the last page well written dramatic and surprising thank goodness his work has been newly translated 
jewels of the sun the gallaghers of ardmore trilogy if you are a nora roberts fan you will not be disappointed in this trilogy the added fantasy of fairies and ghosts and the fey irish who believe in them are a delight i ve read all three and they are all as good as the first you will move into the gallagher clan and become part of the family and their fortunes 
success story i wished i hadstarted a businesslong ago my teachers in school made business sound so hard i was turned off thank you for changing my life forever i just wished it waseasier to find more of these on tape 
not preachy but really interesting in so many ways what really caught my attention was the fact the author shows over and over how we so often eat even if the stuff we are eating is stale popcorn or food that on second thought we wouldn t even feed to a stray starving dog that food for us is often more emotional than nutritional or helpful after reading the book i find myself stopping before i reach for something to eat asking myself if i am actually hungry and if so if what i am about to eat is worth my time i even find that i am planning meals better so i get as much bang from them as possible i also found the authors research on what men and women see as comfort foods interesting guess i am more male minded since i also like soup this is a book one will probably pick up and re read and glean new information from not preachy at all but full of wise information and fun to boot 
all for one and one for all i remember the rexall stores in the late fifties not here in knoxville but doted around in the small towns of middle tennessee louis liggett started the company in boston in and they compounded drugs back then as aspirin was almost the only thing available in pill form when i was in my young teen years the only thing i could swallow was carter s little liver pills i still can t get the generic calcium down the rexall products were all high quality and inexpensive then the drug manufacturing companies came along and after years put them out of business that s why prescription medicines are so expensive today and why we have to depend on them the generics are worthless as far as i m concerned as they are not regulated and not the same as brand names no way ! if they were they would cost more everyone knows you get what you pay for on radio in there was a rexall magic hour in they presented the phil harris alice faye show it included a full cast with two young girl singers and ten men doing sundry things in addition to the two stars something like garrison keilor s prairie home companion show in early television nbc sponsored the half hour program the rexall theatre on sunday nights during the summer months which starred pat o brian as your corner drug store pharmacist the had a talking penny in some of their ads comedian louis nye advertised their products on t v with the motto all for one and one for all edgar bergen and his dummy charlie mccarthy appeared on the cover of the rexall magazine the streamlined rexall train criscrossed the united states from boston to l a and served most states exceptions were nevada and west virginia but skipped knoxville for a route going from chattanooga to nashville to memphis we had the southern and l n railways for this area the ticket shown was similar to mine every summer to washington d c on southern railway we still have an active freight railroad in knoxville locally owned and making noise day and night sometimes it wake me up as i sleep with my window open as i did in the old days it works out of the old l n terminal renovated for the world s fair in place of rexall we now have walgreen s the thing i dislike the most about this firm is the problem of substituting for the medicines your doctor prescribes not generic but something totally different with unnecessary ingredients added this could cause harm to a person s health there are a handful of small locally owned drug stores long s in west side of town being the most popular in pulaski reeves s on the square will still sell a nickel coke gregory macdonald wrote about it in one of his books a world too wide check it out 
nice guide for preparing a ceremony this is a pleasant book but it is more of a guide for ceremony preparation with good structure and nice ideas but a small selection of elements and readings it is enjoyable and easy reading together with another heftier ceremony book such as judith johnson s the wedding ceremony planner or diane warner s complete book of wedding vows or another such book it s be enough for an engaged couple to plan their ceremony it will be staying on my shelf 
best bible ever i really love this bible ! it is so cool to be able to check a passage written in four translations all on the same page i used to carry my traditional bible translation niv study and the message version around all the time to compare verses i often find the message speaks to me at a deeper level than other translations and it was cumbersome now i just use this one bible most of the time and use my old study bible occasionally the book is well constructed and the font size is not as small as i thought it would be parallel bibles are a great idea and this is the best one i have found 
a good starting point a good book for beginners and those who are just beginning research on the various mythical beasts she covers nearly every creature within mythology quite a few of which i never heard of at times it felt as though she wasn t saying enough about a creature but she did give enough to go on to further research each one 
excellent book on leg care this is really an excellent book for a novice to find out about what s going on with their horse s legs you can sit down and read about the things people are telling you but you don t understand like when my friend s horse had to be kept in a stall for six months it seemed like torture but once she read this book she understood what the ligaments looked like when they were torn and why it was so important not to let the horse out in the pasture there are lots of photos and drawings so you know what the author is talking about 
the joy is in the footnotes as a religious reader of simmons stuff online i was sketpical about buying this book the extensive footnotes however which contain added jokes exponential material and goofy asides made it more than worthwhile the fun of this collection wasn t so much in reading the articles again but in learning what the author thought about them as time passed 
eastern and western medical wisdom a collection of simple ways to improve the quality and quantity of your life combining eastern and western medical wisdom 
beyond proposals successful business writing on a whole i bought this book to help the small custom software firm that i work for improve the way we do business i felt like we were losing way too many jobs and the more i thought about it i felt our proposals may be the culprit after reading this book i realized that i was right the great news is that this book is laid out very well and easy to apply immediately to the way you do business i can t count the number of aha moments i had while reading this it seems we tend to write proposals based on what we ve seen of other proposals and it turns out those other proposals weren t very good either one of many useful elements of this book is the way it lays out exactly what sections a proposal should have and what order they should be in to be most persuasive lastly what i took away from this book and the reason i recommend it is that it is just a very solid business writing primer as well the structure for writing persuasively is worth the price of the book in and of itself highly recommend 
a good companion to the blue book i ve recommended this as a supplementary text for my legal writing classes for several years now dworsky provides good additional commentary on the otherwise opaque rules of the bluebook my only complaint is that he favors underlining over italics for case citations my experience is that most attorneys now prefer italics 
realistic battle scenes and strategies this is a pretty exceptional book there are three major strengths of the book from the perspective of shaara s writing ability first michael shaara has the rare ability to describe battle scenes including the horror and chaos in a manner that makes these battles accessible and realistic and immediate to the reader very few writers have this gift tolstoy was able to capture the cat and mouse game between napoleon and czar alexander the great in war and peace victor hugo was able to capture the chaos of waterloo in les miserables ian mcewan captures the sad retreat to dunkirk in atonement robert graves captures trench warfare during world war i in goodbye to all that and joseph heller captures the absurdity of war in catch i would have to say that michael shaara comes very close to the writing skills of tolstoy hugo mcewan heller and graves in terms of describing the unfolding of battle second michael shaara is a master at capturing the male or masculine mind i do not mean to be stereotypical here but it is very much a man s book i say this because michael shaara was able to capture male friendship male envy and competition male humor which can be dark sarcastic and gross and the manner in which males respond to a chain of command third shaara is superb at developing individual characters exploring the internal dynamics that make them tick and that lead them to take the actions and positions that they take under certain conditions such as the stress of warfare this aspect of the book was fascinating the portrait of general lee was fair and balanced lee was suffering from cardiovascular disease and was the retired head of west point as a military theoretician he was still under the influence of napoleon bonaparte s military theories he wished to be well informed so as to make the best decisions and then to engage the enemy when he thought he had the advantage he is usually contrasted with the union general mcclellan who frustrated president lincoln because of mcclellan s continuous delays and preparations and avoidance of engagement with the enemy however general lee failed to adjust his military strategy to the improvement in firearms technology it is general longstreet who is one of the two most interesting characters in the story for longstreet recognized that improved firearm technology changed the equation in regard to battleground tactics longstreet s conceptions were not appreciated during the civil war and unfortunately were not appreciated during world war i when so many of europe s young men died senseless deaths by charging machine guns the character of joshua lawrence chamberlain is a wonderful counterpoint to longstreet longstreet is in constant mourning for his four children all of whom died in one day of fever chamberlain on the other hand is pschologically very healthy with the ability to respond to those around him with a healthy range of emotions longstreet was a military genius but unfortunately a genius that was unrecognized as such because of the aura and mantle of sainthood that the south had conveyed onto general lee chamberlain on the other hand was a college professor who was not trained to be a soldier but who was extremely pragmatic and resourceful this is a very enjoyable book full of history well written

he talks to dead people very helpful and detailed book interesting and explains many realities or views of life events and how to handle the engeries of ghost activities understanding things from their point of view 
prose with a unique flavor other reviews have given the outline of the narrative but a good way to convey the strength and variety of the writing not always cynical as some suggest is to follow the example of the reviewer who quoted the first line as a touchstone sell the apples by offering a free bite in that respect here are a few more snippets good and evil keep very exact accounts said the centaur and the face of every man is their ledger i wonder now if any of you gentlemen he is talking with four archangels in heaven never mind can give me news of that lisa who used to be my wife he described her and they regarded him with compassion but he does not only talk of emotion in terms of a contrast between cosy if imperfect domesticity and casual eroticism he acknowledges passion queen anaitis says for i and none but i can waken that desire which uses all of a man and also wastes nothing even though it leave that favoured man for ever after like wan ashes in the sunlight to me that ranks with racine s famous venus toute enti re  sa proie attach e incidentally an amusing example of that casual eroticism which got the book into so much trouble is when chloris is somewhat alarmed by his staff and therefore jurgen hid his staff where chloris could not possibly see it you can see where that could cause problems in the s the great enforcer comstock had only died a few years before and his society for the suppression of vice was active today it rates nothing more than a mild chuckle and an appreciation of an alternative to biological detail 
really quite thought provoking all parents should read this and do what they can to foster real play in their children this book makes me realize just how many plastic toys my daughter has in her room how stain free her clothes are because she doesn t like to get dirty and how much she is missing because of all of that she needs to get outside more fly more kites read the book then you ll know about kites ! dig more dirt bring home more bugs and animals and make up her own rules and her own games many well intentioned parents myself among them are doing more harm than good to their kids by teaching them how to play enrolling them in organized activities keeping them away from germs and filling their rooms with stereotyped plastic toys yikes ! what are we doing i am so very glad i bought this book and if anything i have said in this review strikes a chord with you then please buy a copy for yourself i know you won t be disappointed you ll be inspired if you like this book check out a day in the garden by bettina steitencron it is a wordless picture book favorite of ours !

icons viewed by the orthtodox among the many books on icons this is one of the oldest still in print why has it become a classic because it was written by one of the greatest twentieth century theologians vladimir lossky and by one of the greatest th century iconographers leonide ouspensky who spent the whole of his artistic life in france painting icons and frescoes their approach is unique not only because of their deep experience of the orthodox faith but also because of the way they decided to describe the colour prints reproduced in this volume what we have here is a superb commentary in the form of selection of poetry from the feasts during which these icons are placed in the middle of the church much of this byzantine hymnography has no parallel in the west it is what is heard in the eastern christian church throughout the liturgical year which this volume beautifully illustrates both in word and image the authors feeling for the uplifting prayer of which icons play such a vital part is genuine and rarely found in any other book about the iconographic tradition all christians and many non christians will appreciate their respectful presentation of the revelation of god to man as it is presented in this book

not for everybody nikki giovanni as a credit to american poetry but one has to realize that what she write is for everybody to compare her to somebody less controversial like maya angelou for example is not unthinkable she has never written along those lines and at this stage of her life she never will the beauty in her poetry comes in her raw honesty giovanni isn t writing for a particular audience she isn t reaching out to be the next poet speaking at a presidential convention she is speaking from her heart her experiences are not those of many people both white and black so many people can not relate however for those that can nikki giovanni is more than a writer she is an american treasure 
great gift for a friend strarting a new job at a new company i bought this book for a friend who was leaving one investment bank to head up a group at another bank after reading the book he told me that the situations described and issues discussed were dead on correct he had thought that the challenges he faced were unique but amazingly this book had illustrated the many common issues facing managers in a new company and gave useful guidance in how to deal with them oddly he said that he couldn t put the book down praise usually reserved for a thriller evidently it applies when a book can improve your life as well

nice to meet you i think i liked this book and i think you should get it but watch out there s a big surprise waiting finding jesus discovering self is a buffet table sort of a book a collection of bible stories about jesus first person stories from the authors poems and quotes from writers famous and otherwise and directions to help the reader reflect react and respond to the ideas presented in the stories ok so far the bible stories are familiar the personal reflections engaging and interesting the poems and quotes enlightening and easy to read it s like a long dinner table conversation with those smart compassionate well read friends you always wished you could spend more time with there s a magic bookshelf that pops out the perfect quote the poem the literary example at just the right time as the evening goes on though something a little disturbing starts to happen the talk turns to you me and the friends start to tell their stories in a more intimate way revealing not just the easy morals or the funny parts but how they fell short were disappointed didn t act right learned a hard lesson the hard way something about the way they tell their story makes it impossible for you to stay silent and you find yourself talking thinking feeling in ways you hadn t expected it gets tougher the friends use challenging words like imagine it differently ask yourself what the other person is feeling or name your unfinished business caren goldman is a friend and in the interest of full disclosure when i read this book i could imagine her at our dinner table telling these stories running to the bookshelf for the rilke poem that put the idea just right fixing me with that look when i m less than honest with myself bill dols i ve never met but i know things about him from these stories and i ve let him sit at my dinner table too both caren and bill present jesus in a new way too not the gospel of certainty but the gospel of questions love embodied in the unanswered far more than the answers these old familiar stories that jesus told or that were told about jesus are presented like a familiar stone or a picture we ve seen forever they ask us to turn it a little hold it in a different light look from closer in i read the good samaritan story then they asked me to imagine that i was the priest who walked on by or the robbers who stripped and beat him ! their questions for reflection take the story all the way home look around you who do you pass by every day they quote the talmud milan kundera and poet derek wolcott i get up from the banquet the dinner conversation the engagement that this book invites a little tired it s not an easy self help affirmation this book it s hard the jesus i thought i knew is different from the one i meet in this book so is the self this book asks us to look at the beauty the ease the love but also the anger the selfishness the disappointment smell the flowers of course but smell the funk too acknowledge the rest of the picture live with the tough questions its not easy i stopped a couple of times i thought i don t really need this and i don t really have time and i m not sure what they believe and if they believe the way i do in the end i found it immensely helpful a powerful experience living the questions raised in this way the questions about jesus the questions about myself is a better way to live it s like the way i feel getting up from that dinner table challenged alive full energized and ready for more caren says that it s her hope that the questions will remain a welcome signpost on your journey to healing and wholeness bill says it s exchanging the insatiable search for meaning in the bible for the opportunity to read sacred narratives as life s drama around and within me around the middle of the book there s a little ts eliot poem that summarizes the genius of this book for me we shall not cease from explorationand the end of all our exploringwill be to arrive where we startedand know the place for the first time

more a series of newspaper columns than a book i enjoyed this book quite a bit but it only really works in the context of other reading on contemporary israel he focuses on the americanization of israel a fascinating topic but this is a book of essays not of scholarship furthermore segev assumes a fair amount of knowledge of jewish and israeli history he s a good writer and this is a fun read for someone who is familiar with trends in israeli life he doesn t however really set out to prove his thesis also it would probably not be terribly interesting to someone with little or no background in the subjec 
do yourself a favor and read this book hi all if your like me you know a thing or two about diets also if your like me you ve heard this wacky idea about how to lose weight without dieting i have read so many books about non dieting but never was really able to do it i honestly believe that for me the thoughts and ideas outlined in this book is what i always needed to hear linda moran has a way or writing that is genius in it s simplicity she never talks down to the reader and yet still finds a way to challenge old beliefs somehow making you internalize it even more maybe if we disfunctional eaters can learn even one or two things from this book we can finally begin to heal ourselves from the bonds that have held us back for so long i for one am finally begining to see a light at the end of the tunnel and even am learning to embrace the tunnel itself thanks for this wonderful book

nurturing concepts for all creative genres it was a an italian virtuoso contrabassist who told me to read these lectures stefano plays all the arduously difficult new music literature for the contrabass he travels with a violoncello so he can play all that repertoire as well when he plays this music he often ponders calvino five primary conceptual corridors toward what he thought of as literature but music as well can be contemplated with these ideas quotlightnessquot well music has a density mozart played games with it and interpreting mozart can be a treatise in the dialectic the transformations and timbral modulations of lightness to heaviness ask any violinist calvino of course expounds on kundera s popular book on the weight of the lifeworld of living in the east the coal dusted passageways or of a fallen love begun transgressivly there as well dante is a frequent pilgrim example here the lightness of snow falling imperceptibly on the mountainside quotquicknessquot but not how fast things move our silicon valley odious airjets that may puncture the ozone layer or violins but the quickness of an image to transform our consciousness to lighten it up from the cruel oppression of citylife thats poetry i think robert musil is here as well the complexity the numbering imagination of his transitory work to modernity the opening two decades of this century his quotman without qualities quot a seemingly endless work and gedda s quotawfull mess quot on the street a probing detective novel of complexity of a murder in rome on the way to the labor bureau of the roman government in music i frequently think of visibility when i have nothing to transport me into the bowels of a bruckner or an antheil symphony what do i see in the music like the weight of this century in the quotlargoquot from the quotfifth symphony quot of shostakovich multiplicity as well another calvino chapter is here sprouting its wings like a peacock all around us if we only have the patience for it to phanthom and explore all images of a work as looked at through a plexiglass we seldom do that how exact is art quotexactitudequot is what leonardo di vinci lived his life with rewrote almost everything calvino tells us as leopardi the essays

a nice ride once again i am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject i bought this to get a better feel for the old testament operative word is feel as a roman catholic the old testament is addressed in the first reading at mass but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner it is particularly confusing hard to read and difficult to understand in proper context without some help in fact there are portions of the old testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous davis s book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people in a certain time and place and within a historical milieu it may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like but it is sufficient to be effective it is just too simplistic to look to the bible for all answers as if it were some sort of statutory code with the answers to all questions the search and answers for truth are never ending and the bible is a beginning i get more from catholic writers who explore the bible and the traditions of my religion relative to our world than i do from the book itself davis is throwing in his spin as well as a pretty accurate assessment of the bible in historical context which i found quite helpful take it for what is worth a spin in a convertible through the bible a nice ride but nothing more 
do not go to disneyland w o reading this book this book was my bible for our trip to disneyland we traveled w young children and so many of the tips and advise in this book was irreplaceable we also purchased birnbaum s disneyland resort expert advice from the inside source birnbaums disneyland which was a good book too but since it s the authorized version you feel like you are looking through rose colored glasses as you read the book whereas the unofficial guide to disneyland was great for giving you all the pros and cons not just disneyland is great buy all our souveniers lol birnbaum s book served kinda as an over view for me whereas the unofficial guide got into the nitty gritty of really helping me enjoy my vacation to the fullest 
another great poem by ed sanders sanders has perfected a unique style of narrative poetry this book tells the story of ginsberg s life as a private citizen and as a public figure but it also chronicles his development as a poet for those daunted by the collected or even the selected poems sanders usefully points out what he thinks are ginsberg s best poems as he goes along although i did not intend to when i sat down with it i ended up reading it straight through to the end a very moving ending it was too 
must read for sales managers with new sales people if you are developing fresh talent then you need to have this book i have used this in countless lesson plans when teaching my people the fundamentals of selling this is as close to required reading as you will find gitomer is the ultimate sales guru because he keeps things simple he doesn t teach how to sell he teaches you how to show value so people will buy bible is for beginners in many ways so if you ve been around the block enough to know the way skip this one and grab one of his red books or the patterson principles they are for the more experienced sales professional

a classic reissued j b bury wrote his quothistory of greece quot before world war i but it was such a good overview of classical greek history that the third edition was still being used as a college textbook in the late s although only selected portions of the text were assigned reading i read the book cover to cover and have kept it to this day bury writes in a lucid easily understood style that entertains as it educates although bury recounts campaigns and battles in stirring fashion he does not neglect the greek contributions to politics the arts and sciences except for his obvious dislike of the spartan king agesilaus i found bury to be fair and even handed in his evaluation of the peoples and events that shaped greek history

almost like following a tv series i am always fascinated with anything to do with the middle ages the best attribute of this book is the clarity of its author s writing it is a pleasure to read bishop s words in very plain english i should add this is not a big book and yes you can comfortably read it in the beach or while sunning out in the yard having said that i felt that the format could have been a little better laid out as there will be a tendency for readers who only have a passing interest in history to forget what they read only a few pages ago as each page throws out one detail after next but that also means that this is one of those rare books where you can start reading from almost any page and not be confused all in all a great starter book on the middle ages 
what a guy what a book bill is a true moderate the kind who get to chat with our dear leader who is well known for fielding tough questions from those not numbering among his cheerleaders this proves he s a moderate right and say what you will bill s done a great job of making his church going followers forget about his sexual harassment of his secretary that cost him well into the six figures to make go away rush takes first place though for cheerleading the drug war while being an addict himself if being able to hold contradicting thoughts in one s mind is a sign of intelligence their fans are geniuses if you love bill you ll love his book

terrific resource and not just for anime fans my kids were adolescents back in the s when japanese animation began to be seen on american tv and for a long time even though i d been interested in modern japanese literature since college i unconsciously equated anime with speed racer then i learned better and became a semi fan enough to rent several of the best reviewed series from blockbuster but i had never sat down to learn the milieu of the art form until i came across this author s two books on the subject he covers a very wide range of japanese cultural stuff from names of historical periods and the different types of bells you find in temples to major writers whose work has been adapted in anime and the reason for the big eyepinkhair thing you ll no longer wonder why guys in japan get nosebleeds from looking at girls what the sound of cicadas in the background are intended to imply and why you shouldn t be upset that some anime meant for kids includes mild nudity for that matter he goes into the sexual psychology of various other japanese folkways too with no embarrassment or leering which supplies the cultural context you really need if you re going to understand this stuff actually this book would be useful not only to would be otaku but to any westerner puzzled by various aspects of japanese society there s a new thicker edition coming out soon and i m definitely going to have to acquire it

the corvinus clan here s an overview marcus is after selene because in her past a past she doesn t remember at first is the location of a dungeon her father built inside is william his brother locked in a cage for over years marcus is close to his bother and wants to free him the brother was imprisoned by viktor after a murderous rampage that was killing thousands of people and turning them in werewolves but without the ability to change back william himself is always in lycan form throughout the entire book and marcus is usually always in his hybrid form preferring that to the human mask he can wear we are introduced to a group of people known as the cleaners they clean up the mess the lycans and vampires make they are the people who blackmail or payoff witnesses to keep their mouth shut they have documented the history of the vampires and the lycans and the war between the two selene spends most of the book saving michael until he dies by the hand of marcus violently as well selene discovers she loves him but it is too late meeting the cleaner s leader she is offered a chance to get revenge because although the leader had the opportunity he couldn t bring himself to kill marcus with the help of the cleaner s elite crew they fly to the dungeon to try and stop marcus from releasing william on a world not ready to understand such a creature in a body bag is michael selene can t bare the thought of leaving him behind he lies at her side and she transforms her love for him into hate aimed at marcus she knows she is going up against a force much stronger than her even with the gift from the cleaner s leader fighting marcus and possibly william is near suicide especially when she realizes that she is too late and the two brothers are united once again and william has years of hunger to sate while this is happening something miraculous is happening to michael dead cells are sparking to life and the genetic code is multiplying fractured ribs reknit themselves ripped organs healed a new heart blossomed and brain activity resumed but this new michael is stronger smarter and the sub hero of this book that he is meant to be still things are not easy in their battle william is strong and smart and damn fast faster than selene and michael all the cleaners are killed by william and they turn into werewolves to fight and destroy our heroes this book reads much like a movie meaning that greg cox didn t add as much into the story as he did for book one book one is pages this is with a larger font still the book is a damn fine read as we wait for the movie to be released and it is a tight and entertaining read the hours will zip by this book needs to be on your shelf next to the first book which is next to the first dvd sadly though this book i feel will only be appreciated by the cult fans of the first book movie of which i am one 
a wonderfully hopeful and uplifting story by the time i had got to page i was hooked i found the language a little slower to read than normal having to get used to the speech of the slaves being written as it sounded but i actually got to quite like that harriet beecher stowe writes as if she s the narrator and i could almost see her at the side of the stage inviting us to see the next scene as we follow the lives of uncle tom eliza and george the many people they encounter and whose lives they touch and whose lives touched them i cried and i smiled and i felt very humble this is a very moving book yet oddly without being sentimental and that is to the author s credit she writes well and makes every character very real and their situations both heartwrenching yet uplifting a book that not only gives a valuble insight into life at the time in kentuck and what it was like to be sold down the river but one that gave me a hope and uplifting that i d like to stay with me for some time to come 
unintentionally classic it s a terrible book the characters are uninteresting the motivations are obscure the machinery is obvious the sex is strange and unerotic the writing is terrible but in spite of everything naked came the stranger is a hoot there s nothing you can point at and say this redeems but the book is so weirdly enjoyable that it really doesn t matter read it in autumn hide it from your friends finish it in an afternoon one of my all time favorites 
if you liked mccullough s quottrumanquot mccullough s quottrumanquot taught many of us about the beginnings of the cold war and the nuclear age if this book isn t as quotentertainingquot as mccullough s book about harry truman not many writers are as entertaining as david mccullough it is certainly a quotmust read quot if you want to fully grasp what harry truman s presidency was all about the gravity of the problems it faced and how cold war policies came into being also the quotcreationquot of nato a subject quite relevant nowadays acheson was indeed a marvelous writer and this work offers tremendous insight into what went on quotat the creation quot of cold war politics acheson was a brilliant individual truman certainly recognized the combination of political talent and genuine humanity when he saw it acheson withstood a lot absolute trash thrown at him by mccarthy and his cohorts ironically so since it was truman s original policies that opened the door to that sort of thing but survive it all he did and so did we and as a result posterity has lots of good things to say about this wonderfully creative and far sighted patriot this book fills in many of the details that quottrumanquot simply didn t have room for a biography written by a man we learned far to little about in school and college 
practical homicide investigations excellent reference book i am a criminal investigator the timely manner i received the product was appreciated 
if only there were more churches like this one we ve been living in a new city searching for a church where we could invite any of our friends regardless of their background life situation and past church experience or lack of without fear of putting them in an uncomfortable situation a much larger order to fill than we had expected because as it turns out many people are not comfortable in church period this book explains how that has come to be and why churches are struggling but most importantly it demonstrates exactly how churches and all christians can and should reach out to and meet the needs of an ultra diverse population with diverse backgrounds lifestyles and situations this is not watereddown christianity or moral relativism contrarily it is biblical christianity in its best purest most powerful and effective and user friendly form for anyone interested in effectively reaching the seemingly unreachable the author is incredibly engaging and easy to read but be warned that the substance might just change your perspective on church and religion ! 
i recommend this book for everyone this is not a large book but it is a wonderful book i highly recommend this book for everyone especially for gifts i would love to read more books like this it is truly an inspiration

a masterpiece this is the defining book on the man who defined the game that defined america in the early th century the big bam is a wonderful set piece about ruth and the times in which he lived and shaped to a large degree the anecdotes about the babe are insightful and entertaining the narrative is lively and lucid and the whole is greater than its parts i came away with a keen sense of the man that he was a perpetual adolescent whose enormous talent helped transform baseball from chess on grass to the modern power game via the home run

excellent reading this book is a great read a poignant account from a group of wwii airborne veterans not high ranking staff officers that experienced the inhuman realities of war but more than that the underlying message as the book was appropriately titled was a group of young men with eclectic backgrounds and aspirations came to be brothers i would be doing the book injustice if i tried to write an accurate synopsis of it and by accuracy not only do i mean the historical facts but also the human emotional triumphs and travesties that is conveyed in this work i ll let the author and accounts from the various members of easy company speak for themselves get this book it s definitely one to add to your library

john glenn was reading his own book so i decided to save time amp go with the audio albeit abridged version i figured it would be light amp easy not that gleen isn t smart it s just that there is no pretense to the man his stories are interesting if his delivery leaves something to be desired they reveal little about the inner man it is a standard straight ahead autobiography of a man who isn t a writer he was sucessful in several different fields then retired to do the best part all over again hero is an overused word today but he a real one that s a go so are his memoirs 
highly recommended anyone interested in learning about conservative presbyterian amp reformed from now on p amp r theology should consult this book coming from a calvinistic baptist background there are certainly a number of things that i would disagree with in the book however reymond has done a very good job presenting p amp r theology in a clear but scholarly fashion though many will complain that the book is not balanced and treats some subjects superficially reymond s objective was to articulate what the p amp r tradition teaches rather than giving us a comprehensive systematic theology try erickson s instead some p amp r people will find that reymond is too logical rather than biblical and that he relies on gordon clark too heavily for his view on revelation god s nature the atonement election and theodicy for example reymond is unapologetically supralapsarian in his view of the decrees pp and insists that whatever comes to pass is good because it is willed by god see section on theodicy on pp also his view of christ s eternality is also controversial departing from the standard nicene view a view which i disagree with reymond however you have to give him good marks for trying to defend his particular position besides these questionable positions reymond does an excellent job defending a very high view of the inspiration of scripture liberal quotchristiansquot perhaps should read up on this section he also does a good job defending the typical calvinist understanding of fallen man that fallen man is totally depraved and unable to save himself another aspect of this book i like is the way he presents the orthodox reformed understanding of the covenants of the bible he follows the traditional westminsterian scheme of a dual covenant of works covenant of grace structure covenant of works meritorious salvation covenant of grace salvation by faith in christ alone though i do not agree with this structure reymond has given us a good treatment of the topic from a historic reformed perspective his section on soteriology is very well done following the traditional reformed schema and his section on ecclesiology is very informative expousing the presbyterian and paedobaptist perspective his section on eschatology could have been better he writes from an amillennial perspective but gives lots of scripture passages to defend his viewpoint however many will find his sections on the divergent views of eschatology very informative pp the appendices are also useful even giving us a brief treatment on the calvinistic tulip pp finally the bibliography section on other systematic theologies is very handy for theology students pp one final note before i close someone below was disappointed because reymond didn t really interact with the so called new perspective on paul reymond does this in his book on paul s theology this book was not a place for reymond to interact heavily with this growing movement however the new perspective is a new movement that is trying to influence i should say infiltrate the p amp r tradition reymond defends the orthodox protestant view of justification pp the new perspective is trying to destroy the teachings of the past years reymond does briefly discuss daniel fuller s and e p sanders views on pp and p footnote respectively reymond does a convincing job telling the readers that the view of justification and law promoted by these two authors faithworks justification is a departure from reformed and protestant orthodoxy reymond is not trying to put down quotbiblical theology quot here but trying to defend the correct view of justification by faith alone sola fide those who have a problem with reymond on this issue are those people who are trying to legitimize their stay within the protestant tradition while denying a major tenent of the tradition perhaps they should find a different home to expouse their works salvation gospel only one perspective is right both cannot be this book is a must read for all who are interested in p amp r theology 
read this little story the tale of tangle and mossy two child like creatures on the adventure of the ages alone together parting re uniting until which is which becomes forgotten and un threatening and best so unimportant simply this is the best fairey tale i have ever read it is a classic if you know anyone with fantasy and imagination regardless of age this whould be a most welcome gift addendum to a reader it is difficult to respond to a question after the questioner has left the room who is dr peter kreeft and what makes his opinion so important to you it is sad that such a beautiful and wonderful story is so assaulted by a need to find the incarnation of god himself within it not that he she is not but please isn t that the bibles role i think you last three comments point to your problem that is you really want someone to tell you what this book really means suggestion perhaps if you read the story to a child or a very old person over the course of three or four day you might find it much more appealing best regards 
a classic romance i m a real sucker for victorian age novels so of course i picked this one up i absolutely loved it the story follows jane eyre a poor girl with a crummy childhood through her stay with the cruel reed children to a poor hard boarding school where she was taught and through her life as a governess she teaches a young french girl and gradually falls in love with the master of the house but the love is that sort of forbidden love jane struggles with this love and her low position in life it s a classic beautiful romance novel full of love and the complications in love i ve read many victorian romance novels but this one tops them all i loved it and my mother read it when she was younger and loved too just goes to show how good literature never dies if you enjoy a good quality book read this it s a wonderful romance novel that doesn t take an eternity to read what s not to love 
an honest assessment this book purports that through the use of positive thought and mental imaging one can change their life and character the way this book communicates this idea is by giving success stories and briefly explaining the process itself here is the real deal about this practice it works but it doesn t usually come all at once and give people continuous miraculous results like any skill worth possessing it takes persistence practice and trial and error people often experience much initial success when first trying out the principle of mental science or affecting circumstance through thought and creative visualization but they often experience some difficulties also its not a panacea for life its a practice that deepens over time and through effort and study this is a great book because it tells you that you have tremendous latent power within you that you have access to it and that it can change your life well all these things are true and the world needs to wake up to the possibilities of the inner life what the book doesn t emphasize is that more often than not its a process that requires commitment and persistence to acquire as opposed to a magical cure all even so the beginner will see results and those results will continue as they continue gradually becoming more meaningful but perhaps not as explosively as this book emphasizes through its many dramatic success stories my reccomendation for reading the magic of believing enjoy its positive tone and motivational nature and try the practice for yourself claude m bristol has a way with words and this is a great place to start learning about some really cool principles however also know that sometimes the real transformation occurs not through a good book and a little bit of practice but through sustained and sincere hard work just like any other skill or field of study the good news is if you find that metaphysics the science described in this book is your bag and you are willing to put in the hours the results will be worth it 
superb this is the best edition of chaucer on the market including all of his major works if you re serious this is the one to get 
so funny this book was so funny ! i would be sitting somewhere and just start laughing out loud thinking about something funny from the book i loved it from start to finish and i plan on reading the rest of the shopaholic books 
a key to understanding the enigma of u christianity metaphorically has many keys many prominent voices play major keys promising blessings and offering comfortable settings christian scharen the author of one step closer introduces a minor key the theology of the cross that fits u s voice the theology of the cross fits u because it avoids the all too common proclamation of faith hope and love that ignores the present realities of doubt despair suffering and injustice it is a tradition that looks at the world and speaks the truth about what it sees the good the bad and the ugly in the words of the church reformer martin luther the theology of the cross calls a thing what it really is this book helps make sense of u s style of talking about god jesus the spirit and the christian life in a holistic way it s an excellent resource for those wanting to understand the spirituality found in the band s lyrics it also serves as a mini lesson in theology especially as it pertains to the cross and the different forms of communication found in the bible the author provides keen insight into the psalms the wisdom literature the parables prophecy and apocalyptic writing in the first section of the book in each chapter a different pattern of speech is examined with examples of how u mirrors the style and content of that particular form the second section focuses on the theology of the cross with u it s a way of singing truthfully and unflinchingly about god and the world god loves it is a way of speaking that highlights faith over certainty hope over despair selfless love over the self indulgent pursuits that tempt the church and its leaders to grab power and money for themselves once again the author provides specific examples from the band s music the last section introduces the idea of living the truth as a way to live the cross it provides an account of how u lives out their faith for u following god means doing the truth one can easily come away with a greater understanding and admiration for what u is all about the band deserves credit for not succumbing to the popular self fulfillment trends in the church whats especially valuable is the author s ability to introduce readers to the christian tradition by illustrating from u his thoughts on cross centered theology are rewarding and worth more than one read this is a scholarly but easy to read work the author displays a mastery of theology and u he more than adequately supports his contentions through scripture almost exclusively from the message bible and an analysis of the band s lyrics and interviews this book is a valuable edition to the growing volume of literature on u it would have been helpful if the author would have elaborated more on some of the controversial elements of u though it may be a minor thing their seeming indifference about drinking smoking and swearing is hard to understand their critical attitude toward the church and some christians is understandable but a little troubling some christians feel that u is not christian enough ironically you can see from reading this book that u follow in the tradition of the cross by speaking honestly and pointing toward sacrifice and service toward others in so doing they have turned it around and indirectly challenged the church and individual christians to be more christian 
wondeful fun i read this to my month old almost every night he loves the fabulous illustrations and the silly rhymes and of course we add all the animal noises my nieces and nephews are similarly enthralled when they come to visit after one such visit my sister inlaw suggested we get this book for my nephew s upcoming birthday so here i am ordering another copy ! commotion in the ocean is delightful in the same way 
on the origins of the enlightenment i m going to break with the consensus and state upfront that i was not overly impressed with rousseau s discourse on the origin of inequality there are a number of problems with the work and taken at its face value it does not present much to the enlightened reader firstly i ll start with the one issue for which rousseau cannot be faulted and that is age rousseau was an enlightenment thinker but that doesn t mean he had many correct facts at hand in this respect i would highly recommend the discourse as a historical document what it says about inequality is rather marginal but what it says about the state of philosophy in mid eighteenth century france is invaluable but the facts are still wrong rousseua spends most of his time talking about mankind living in a state of nature this means living as the primitive societies of rousseau s time did at least in his mind he presents what is essentially the noble savage model of prehistory and what a noble savage he presents too to modern eyes of course some of his assumptions about life in a state of nature are downright humorous it goes without saying that modern readers have an enormous benefit in this regard this is actually a good look at what educated people thought about in those days if rousseau wasn t well read then we could say that no one was he does periodically cite contemporary scientists of his day on the zoological arts and this can be enlightening for us as well as for the author where rousseau gets into trouble is in his transition from the state of nature to the state of civilization his thesis is that inequality is a result of civilization but he transitions into this in a rather awkward manner basically he makes a few speculations based on his state of nature ideas about what early man must have done at moments as we gained use of speech and agriculture and such basic things i didn t think he ever really made a connection in part this is because his premise is so badly flawed though it is not the author s fault it does tend to contaminate his entire argument that follows but even more than that he could be completely correct about the state of nature but still blunder into his conclusions i will do rousseau credit by taking his argument at face value i don t think that as an enlightenment philosopher he would be offended if his facts were later shown to be faulty nor does the author ever give the idea that he considers this the final set instone word on the matter but the argument is still weak as i said the primary value today for a reader of the discourse is historical rousseau is reasonably clear about what he means and the work is short so novice readers should not be put off by reading this particular primary source from that era it shows that the enlightenment movement was willing to make bold new statements and work with what they had to find out what they could do as a piece in the long story of intellectual discovery the discourse stands on its own

another hit from stross as in his other books accelerando iron sunrise and singularity sky this is a novel of post singularity after the non biological entity has become conscious and evolved with a terrifying speed into the eschaton which is beyond human comprehension in this tongue in cheek horror tale alan turing completed his last theorem and a turing machine was born unfortunately this opened the gateway to a universe of awful creatures battling this is our intrepid hero bob and his sidekicks of computer geeks indeed it reads like a funny mi noirehorrorscifi jack of all trades as the nerds save the world from certain doom 
i love it at first i thought that this book was useful it turned out to be a must have for everyone ! a great resource and instructional book for almost every aspect of a human being s health ! although people always tend to comfort themselves that nothing s wrong with their health sometime they suddenly find out that they have been having a hidden serious problem that they should consume not less than a billion medicines to cure this books helped me spot the reasons why i had several but minor problems which my mother always tried to convince me to believe that i m a perfectly healthy person now and with the help of hormonal balance i discovered and was able to reach the specific health problems i ve been having for the last years and how will i be able to overcome them highly recommended special thanks and appreciation to dr scott isaacs who seems to have put a lot of effort in bringing up such a perfect solution book 
what a great and most interesting writer eliot weinberger has done a real service to the world of literature by selecting and translating these pieces they show the range of interest the incredible ability to make inventive creative cross connections of one of modern literature s true masters borges borges covers worlds in his writing worlds of literature worlds of the argentinean society he and some of his ancestors grew up in worlds given in a universal encycopediac reading which seems to cover all continents and all cultures borges greatest work is considered to be his ficciones but his signature is present in all in a single page of a book review or a philosphical meditation for him worlds mingle and combine and are retranslated in such a way as to reappear as literature he also in this work reveals himself to be a decent and courageous opponent of fascism he confounds and surprises us at times with these strange mixings of things but the poetic and parable like element is so strong in this work that it engages us and forces us to question our own small pictures of reality what a great and interesting writer what a pleasure to have this work to enrich our minds with 
the true story of pocahontas john smith and chief powhatan everyone is familiar with the story of pocahontas and british explorer adventurer john smith they are romantic stories fed to us by the likes of disney yrs ago in the film and countless romanticized versions in historical fiction novels this documentary book exposes the truth about what really happened in the span of time that john smith jon rolfe and the virginia company founded jamestown and dealt with the indian tribes headed by chief powhatan and his brother openchancanough since thanksgiving is fast approaching this makes a fine book to read if you are interested in the earliest british colonial period of the s when the pilgrims fist arrived in the eastern coast of the united states this period has been romanticized by movies and novels evoking a thrilling time of danger intrigue and romance when indians and colonists sparred and sometimes made peace even made love princess pocahontas was the daughter of chief powhatan she was only fifteen or so when she first met jon smith and a romance was highly unlikely even if perhaps the girl felt an attraction to the supposedly attractive adventurer john smith had traveled across the globe to foreign lands as a british explorer and was in his day a bad boy that he may have gotten into trouble with chief powhatan and his people is probably true pocahontas was a diplomat a healer medicine woman and regarded as a peacemaker even if she didn t do a dramatic a thing as offer herself up as sacrifice to save john smith s life she did for a time lessen tension between the natives and the colonists she married jon rolfe a british nobleman was converted to christianity learned to read and speak english she journeyed across the atlantic leaving behind her old life in the tribe and became a popular figure in london society she became a lady most people forget about this phase in her life and it must have been a very interesting story within itself did she miss her old life was she as respected in london or did she experience a form of racism because she was not a white english lady powhatan s life is documented well in this book he was a very influential man in his time and he too was able to negotiate with the english jamestown brought these people together they hoped that jamestown would be an independent utopian society where english and natives could live and prosper unfortunately jamestown succumbed to disease and death the dream died and conflict between natives and colonists resumed if you re a big history buff this book is for you 
face the fire nora roberts once more hits stars with this trilogy if you love roberts this is one of her finest 
pulp fiction in a book this book reminded me of the movie pulp fiction it took a while to get into it but boy was i glad i stuck with it the plot was a wee bit complicated but well written and written in a way that made you want to stick with it different characters flew around the pages but eventually everything came together and made perfect sense it was the type of book that when i d finished i placed it on my read again list 
enjoyable fiction tying past present based on the description i expected this to be a davinci code knock off but gave it a shot since i recieved a free copy comparing labyrinth to the davinci code do it injustice this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it s own right i enjoyed the characters plot and switching between the past and present i m not sure it has literary value i wouldn t argue that the davinci code does either but it s certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow 
thorough as usual you know you re in for a long read when the original hardcover came in two volumes ! but anyone familiar with michener knows not to be put off by that as with his other fictionalized histories the stories here and there are many are a fairly good reflection of what really happened in the place being profiled this time it s south africa and the time span is from prehistory to with a heavier concentration on more recent decades writing just over a decade before apartheid fell michener really does seem to have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible as to how that shameful chapter of history came to pass as usual his anti heroes are presented evenhandedly leaving the reader to recognize their flaws there are of course plenty of those and they at least keep the very long book flowing pretty well throughout the or so pages his historical research is impressive as always the book s one shortcoming is that it does try to encompass so much over such a long time so after a while its own references to past events become confusing to the reader helpfully there are genealogy charts for the major families in the back of the book but even those sometimes left me barely able to recall the events referred to a few hundred pages down the road and how does it all end without giving anything away i can say it s interesting in retrospect to see what michener or at least his characters were expecting in and when they thought it would come to pass if you like his other historical epics you ll probably like this one too 
thorough deep and enjoyable but a little anthropocentric i enjoyed reading this book very much and would recommend it the discussion was deep and enthralling many issues were explored but some important ones weren t explored quite deeply enough i wonder why although it seems to try not to be i found this work to be too anthropocentric which the very last paragraph illustrates clearly at the end of the day i don t think it s all about us 
dazed and confused satoshi kitamura is the kazuo ishiguro of the under set me and my cat is of my daughter s favorite books and she s a serious fan of kitamura s oeuvre a great book when they ve outgrown duck is dirty and other board books 
a very pleasing read i first read this book about years ago and have been trying to but it for many years now as a larry niven fan i first read it because of his name being on the cover it is unlike other books by niven and not part of his known space series if you find it please give it a try ! it certainly made me smile 
naked kerouac this book is powerful and honest coming out in the same year as burroughs naked lunch the two works bear many striking similaruites compared to the other works by kerouac i ve read on the road the dharma bums and parts of maggie cassidy subteranean angels this book seems strikingly different the work that jack and ginsberg did on the heroin infested burroughs scriblings to come up with the powerhouse work naked lunch must have had a tremendous effect on jack this work shares the disragard for the line between fantasy and reality a compelte self indulgeance of the writer i can see jack with his reams of paper just clacking away howling with leerie laughter like the shadow and a dedication to storytelling and imagination that naked lunch displayed for a whilrwind read fest try to digest the two in succession 
a decision point has come a time to love by robert greenberger is the fifth book in the time to series of star trek the next generation novels taking place immediately before the movie star trek nemesis the first four books were up and down affairs wallowing in trek continuity and occasionally telling a good story a time to love however is the first one that s been fully satisfying it is rather lightweight but for some reason it packs a punch it begins the story of how william riker first officer of the enterprise finally finds himself with a command of his own after all these years under captain picard while concentrating on this and his relationship with deanna troi the book also tells a great story too a time to love is a short book pages but somehow greenberger packs a lot into it the first ten pages are a little slow as he summarizes what s happened so far in the series but he does it in an interesting fashion having troi and riker going through crew transfer applications commenting on what s happened so far and how it s affecting morale this scene is also important as it begins the realization carried throughout this book and the next that riker has to finally make a decision about his life he s years old he and troi have rekindled their romance in the movie insurrection but they haven t moved forward just what is he waiting for plus he has turned down many command opportunities to stay with enterprise but is that still the right thing to do i ve never seen such an effective summary before giving us new information even as it goes over old some of the later scenes such as geordi s do slow down and tell us too much about the past without anything happening but those scenes are not very long the characterization in this book is wonderful riker and troi get the most but everybody else is great too picard is getting fed up with the boring missions that he s been given mainly to keep enterprise out of the spotlight and allow time for the furor to die down picard feels put upon and he wishes for a mission that he can sink his teeth into the delta sigma iv mission turns out to be just what he asked for but perhaps too much his frustration when the ruling council on delta sigma iv is frozen with indecision is palpable as his annoyance with himself when he realizes that he hasn t kept on top of the situation on the enterprise very well during the mission crusher s indecision about the offer to head starfleet medical is hanging over her head and she keeps coming to the realization that she and picard will never have a romantic relationship and she must also look to her career in the meantime though she is determined to do as much to help the people on the planet below as she is able even better are the scenes with the various security officers as they try to quiet the situation down on the planet before it escalates into even more violence we get scene after scene of these officers doing their job many of which look like they re going to end with the typical red shirt ending but they don t always this makes the scenes that do contain something bad even more effective greenberger writes these scenes with tension keeping the reader entranced to know what will happen next these scenes also give wonderful characterization to lt vale the security chief who is responsible for all of these men and women greenberger perhaps has too many times where he says that vale would give her life for picard over emphasizing it a little bit but overall her characterization is quite good kyle riker doesn t figure a lot in this book except by his absence and the effect of the search for him on will these scenes are extremely effective with will contemplating what barriers that have been in the way of the reconciliation of him and his father as well as taking stock of his life riker is taken on his search by one of the natives and they visit the man s home as well emphasizing just what riker has been missing all these years while being full of action and conflict emotional and violent the book makes a very effective character study of will as well as the other regulars i found it incredibly entertaining to read the only weak spot in the novel and this may just be setting up something for the next few books is the geordi and data story where geordi has to scrounge for parts by trading with various other starships in the area like some supply sergeant data suggests that geordi become a true supply sergeant by getting everybody s inventory and seeing what they have and what they need facilitating the delivery of these parts through a ferengi trader this subplot doesn t appear to have anything to do with anything except to give these two major characters something to do i hope that changes but in this book they felt forced into the story and as short as it is i think the other storylines could have been developed a bit more still that is the only true fault a time to love flows very nicely flying by as you read it the prose isn t wonderful but it s greatly functional serving its purpose and getting out of the way these are the characters i know and love and greenberger manages to tone the angst down considerably no mean feat in this series so far this is the first true winner in the series david ro 
superb book some people may like to consider this book legalistic or even self righteously written i stongly disgree with them in his book on courthsip joshua harris prioritized principles over methods he never mentioned how people should do certain courtship procedures in formula fashion instead josh wisely presented christian principles involved in courtship the focus upon these standards of christian conduct make the book applicable to people of almost every age and every culture the author does not boast about his experience but proposes an ideal to the christian youth of today an ideal all would do good to follow this book is highly commendable it is one of the very best among all christian dating books i have ever encountered 
good information good detail and a great number of organizations makes this a decent addition to anyone s fr library 
a sweeping accessible overview of the hypnotic process rick voit ph d co author hypnosis in clinical practice steps for mastering hypnotherapy routledgetrancework is a wonderful achievement in presenting a thorough conceptual framework and understanding of trance states hypnotic communication and the rationale for technique through its clear language thorough review of research and the introduction of powerful and novel teaching formats yapko carefully carries the reader from this well established framework into very practical applications for psychotherapy its progressive building of concepts and logical applications results in a comprehensive discussion of how hypnosis and hypnotic language serve as natural extensions of the therapeutic process to basic skills and clear cut guidelines for the integration of hypnosis into practice this book certainly provides the reader with many practical ideas for hypnotic language induction procedures and clinical treatment planning yet this reviewer believes the book s strength lies in how effectively it lays the groundwork for why these methods make sense his sections on the concepts behind trance and hypnosis human suggestibility and responsiveness brain function and various contexts in which hypnosis is practiced give the reader a depth of understanding that fully restore this meaning to an extent that few other texts achieve this is a book with few if any weaknesses if anything it may have attempted to do too much and yet should any of its elements be removed it would not be the complete work that it is yapko s thorough examination of the myths surrounding hypnosis and how they reflect misinterpretations of the process involved serve to illuminate the alternative truths involved he most effectively dispels myths about hypnosis by examining ways in which responsiveness and suggestibility create the potentials through which we induce trance this assignment of responsibility and further discussion of normal hypnotic phenomena allow the reader to grasp the purpose of techniques as means of utilizing not manufacturing trance behavior in short it successfully replaces the mindset of doing hypnosis with one of being hypnotic unlike many other introductory books trancework carefully and clearly examines those conditions and characteristics in people and in the therapeutic setting that lay the groundwork for hypnotic communication i would recommend this book for students of hypnosis at any level of training for the serious beginner there is probably no more comprehensive and user friendly text available it has been my experience that many professionals who have completed advanced levels of training have not gained a comprehension of the hypnotic process sufficient to comfortably apply their skill with any range or effectiveness in trancework these readers will discover an opportunity to expand their knowledge base while increasing the breadth of their hypnosis skills because of its clarity and scope this book would be of great interest to someone seriously curious about hypnosis 
a great summer read take this to the beach or your favorite vacation spot even out to the yard in the hammock a very sweet book 
good but dated this book presents a fairly empathic view of the saudis it doesn t absolve them of the harshness that often makes up part of their lives but it doesn t dwell on them either i find it objective and balanced the only real problem with the book is that as others have noted it is very out of date the few pages added to this edition don t really cover the incredible transformations that have happened in the country since ms mackey lived there it really should have been re writtena better contemporary book is thomas lippman s inside the mirage current up to even that has already been overtaken by political events in some regards the information is far more applicable to modern saudi arabia 
great it is hard to go wrong with anna pigeon this is like many of her books with the strong nature content and interesting characters keeps you guessing all the way and wondering if she will make it in the end 
keep tissues handy i was skimming the stacks in the grief section when the orphaned adult caught my eye what a cold harsh title i thought yet i was compelled to read it until then i d never come across a book written specifically for those who have lost both parents and it was good to see that someone had finally addressed this life changing event what took so long based on its unparalleled impact and the fact that nearly everyone experiences it you d think there d be a slew of books written on the subject but there isn t levy addresses this scarcity early on by referring to society s impatience with adults who are grieving the loss of an elderly parent it s two weeks then get over it after all it s the natural order of things levy is the revisionist of that theory having gone through the experience himself he knew firsthand that society and the literary world was selling it short and decided to do something about it by writing this book he makes a persuasive case that the loss of both parents and along with them our place called home is a monumental event that deserves more discussion exploration and patience the book is a treasure the author has a wonderful writing style that gives you the sense he is beside you at eye level confiding in you he gently guides you through the minefield of parental loss attempting to describe explain and make sense of some of the most difficult emotions you will ever know at the end of each chapter are beautiful poignant poems written by real people in tribute to the parents they ve lost one of the best features of the book is that as a psychologist who is himself an adult orphan levy is able to write both as a victim and as a learned observer he s able to share his own grief experiences alongside those of his orphaned adult patients it is this melding of his first person accounts as a son husband father and brother with his clients stories and his professional observations of them that gives the book an extra dimension and makes it more rewarding than most for those of you who ve lost both parents and are struggling with the aftermath processing the grief regaining an identity facing your own mortality you ll find much to relate to in this book this is a highly emotional read especially for the bereaved and a box of tissues should be kept handy but while it may evoke tears it also brings comfort that someone has at last recognized the unique issues perspectives and concerns of the orphaned adult levy has brought them out of the shadows and into the light and has made the case for all of us that two weeks is not nearly enough 
great intro to heinlein is this the best book robert heinlein ever wrote no will fans of other heinlein books recognize the sci fi master s style and philosophy yes this book is a great introduction to robert heinlein especially for a younger reader just starting out it captures the philosophy which was an important part of all of heinlein s military sci fi but is shorter than some of his later works and written in the tradition of his juvenile fiction however i would have to agree that it will still be entertaining for adult readers like all great writing this book has several layers which readers will discover as they reread it as they age all inall this is a wonderful book if you are looking for a perfect gift for a younger fan of science fiction look no further

please someone just say something this was a very well done suspenseful tale of the kinds of secrets and pains that occur in families and how the sufferers of those manage them in stiff and proper small town wisconsin in we learn that amanda lost her sister mathilde mattie through the ice on a winter s eve returned from milwaukee after nursing ww i soldiers and suffering a bad relationship amanda has only a year before losing mattie and taking up management of the family farm and the raising of her little niece ruth when mattie s own husband carl returns from war amanda is not particularly forth coming about the circumstances of mattie s death and the two of them exist in the family home almost in a sort of truce amanda taking the lion s share of raising the child ruth and amanda are the story tellers and there is some confusion early on about when things are taking place in the recalled narratives but eventually the cadence of the story picks up and is not only manageable but well done although ostensibly the book is a suspenseful one all roads leading to the discovery of what actually happened to mattie and why it is also a complicated exploration how people deal with the traumas in their lives very well written i was only frustrated by the behavioral limitations that carl and amanda seemed to exhibit there were many times i wanted to shout just say something but i recognize the time period the ethnic and sociological limitations and the behavioral expectations that these people faced and more than anything i felt sorry for them

a good book i admit it took me about weeks to read this book but it was good jane is a very defined character and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic it seemed to make sense the only complaint i have is that i felt many times like i needed a french dictionary at my side when jane talks to adele and occasionally other people it is usually in french with no translation whatsoever but since it was written in a time when most educated people took french what can you expect i would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations the french is not perhaps very important to the story line not that i would know but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying

fantastic presentation of a fantastic series baron and rude s nexus remains one of the best science fiction superhero series ever done and dark horse gives it the treatment it richly deserves in this classy archives format to their credit they ve allowed the three black andwhite issues to remain in black andwhite rather than coloring them allowing the reader to experience the artwork in as close as possible to its original presentation the only thing lacking is the classic flexi disc that was packaged with issue featuring an audio dramatization of that issue s story and with the unforgettable nexus theme song

rebus versus the wolfman i m baaaaaack after reading the first rebus novel knots and crosses i knew i d continue to read the rest of ian rankin s excellent crime fiction stories this is actually the third novel in the inspector rebus series and author ian rankin s prose continues to astound me he masterfully weaves a tapestry of plot character and location throughout nearly every page example from the prologue she drives home the knife the moment she knows from past experience is a very intimate one her hand is gripped around the knife s cool handle and the thrust takes the blade into the throat up to the hilt until her hand meets the throat itself flesh upon flesh jacket first or woollen jersey cotton shirt or t shirt then flesh now rent the knife is writhing like an animal sniffing warm blood covering hilt and hand the other hand covers the mouth stifling screams the moment is complete a meeting touching the body hot gaping warm with blood seething inside as insides become outsides boiling the moment is coming to an end all too soon but this time we re no longer in edinburgh no no inspector rebus is sent to london oh the pain to try and help catch a serial killer whom the local coppers can t pin down they ve nick named the murderer the wolfman because he bites the victims on the stomach after he kills them but why send rebus well in knots and crosses he helped find another serial killer in edinburgh and so george flight a local london cid guy requested scotland s expert rebus sees himself as anything but an expert on such things but reluctantly goes to england s capital to do what he can come to find out he can do quite a bit including getting into lots of trouble he falls for a beautiful psychologist named liza frazer who might have connections with the killer ! disappears for hours or days on end drinks like a fish and goes on television and announces that they ve caught the killer even when he knows they haven t but rebus mind works a bit differently than most folks he can worm his way into a killer s mind as the case unfolds and we again see how rebus past comes to the forefront and aids him in capturing the villain the great thing about rebus is that he s so f ed up that the reader can identify with all of his vices and character flaws he s no superhuman and he knows it but what he does have is a nose for killers and this bodes poorly for them because once rebus is on your trail you ll never get away now it s on to the next in the series ! 
one of my favorites others have said pretty much all that needs to be said but i ve read pretty much everything heinlein has written and this is definitely amoung my favorites 
very good recipes i ve tried most of the meat recipes and have liked them all some could have the spices upped a little bit for more zing i just wish it had more main course recipes i m really not interested in dessert soups and miscellaneous i m disapointed that the recipes don t indicate the approximate number of servings 
somewhat helpful very interesting i myself write westerns so i bought this book in the hopes that it would help my writings be more accurate while the information contained in this book isn t quite as specific as i would have liked it does have some very interesting and entertaining facts such as slang terms cowboys used the terms used for the different hairstyles during the th century and common diseases that plagued the population it also lists the different types of horses which is a tremendous help for me if you write novels or are just an avid history buff of which i am both then i think you will find this book interesting 
wonderful the world lost a real gem of a writer when stan berenstain passed on november together berenstain and his wife jan and eventually their two sons created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families this book is a great example almost all parents are familiar with the difficulty that kids have in learning and practicing good manners and often have a tough time in teaching kids how to be polite one of the best things about this book is that it s not just the kids who are the naughty ones papa bear has some rudeness problems and even mama bear succumbs to an issue at one point it s great for kids to learn that manners are a lifelong skill that will always take a little bit of practice this book is a wonderful place to start 
beautiful i found this book for my little girl after discovering a dinosaur and shark book for my son it is so beautiful i sat in awe for about minutes looking at it when i first received it it s not disney s cinderella so don t look for any comparisons instead it is a beautiful story full of imaginative pop ups that allow little girls to pretend they are in the story as cinderella herself my little girl years just loves to sit with me and my husband and flip through the story even my year old boy loves to look at it

the end of liberalism and the beginning of common sense theodore lowi created quite a splash with this book when it first came out in edition ii came out a decade later while there had been any number of crude and hysterical attempts at deriding the post fdr american state serious political scientists began taking up the challenge in the midst of the bewildering obscenities of lbj s bungled great society the escalation of the vietnam war and the intrigues of the nixon white house as both a period piece and a classic work of political science lowi s book has few rivals save perhaps james buchanan and gordon tullock s the calculus of consent he expertly and lucidly traces the evolution of american public philosophy legislation and jurisprudence and the policy outcomes they produced before during and after the founding of the second republic lowi s version of this story is that rule of law specific legislation of congress delimited by the constitution has degenerated into interest group liberalism broad grants of power to the executive branch which then create powerful agencies with ill defined mandates and capabilities the result is now that anyone with a perceived or real grievance mobilizes for government action bilking the state of more money and resources and adding powers to the executive branch and its deputies that skirt on unconstitutionality this sobering development lowi makes clear should pose serious problems for all political agendas left right and center he concludes with some modest recommendations for what he calls juridical democracy which essentially means a narrowing in scope and an increase in the specificity of the laws congress passes and the president signs bringing them more into line with the powers and limitations enumerated in the constitution such proposals mirror those of tullock and buchanan as well as those of friedrich von hayek despite these associations this is not a conservative book it is an earnest plea for sanity from one of our most thoughtful iconoclastic and independent minded political thinkers urging us to consider the consequences of our government s excesses before it is too late in a post world of soaring budget deficits rampant defense and entitlement spending and mounting threats to civil liberties lowi s book is an urgently relevant reminder that no branch of government nor any political party should be above the law even for the best of intentions

very instructive the truth is that women can have a threesome much easier than a man a woman needs to convince one woman a man has to convince two this book has chapters for single men but most chapters address bi women and couples with a bi woman however men without partners can learn much about gently introducing their next partner to the concept of bi love for single men this book is worth the price just for the chapters on seduction lori tells you how bi women think and operate and more important how all women want to be seduced if men approached women as seductively as bi women do every man would be casanov

loose ballads at first i didn t find much to rejoice about in this collection of poems the expectation berryman sets up with his title is deceptive i found little evidence of dream what i mean is that i found this writing highly literal straight forward and self conscious i e the antithesis of dreamy secondly songs troubled me one of the thing that distinguishes poetry from prose is poetry s musicality and having songs in the title of a collection hints that there may be lyricism within however i found the diction flabby the tone impotent and therefore lacking any semblance of lyricism perhaps what berryman meant by songs is this perhaps these poems are loose ballads without the envoi and without the predicable rhyming scheme ballades address an important person henry in this case and sums up the point of the poems its terrible to sum up a collection of poems or is the dream songs considered one poem in parts but here goes basically in each section we have the protagonist henry in various situations or in mere contemplation the forward for this book is interesting in that along the lines of pound and eliot berryman has made a concerted effort to inform his readership that this is indeed a persona poem and therefore not to be confused with a biographical poem perhaps what berryman has produced here is an eclogue an eclogue is a poem written in the form of a monologue or dialogue in which the speaker tells us what he feels about a particular theme and why and why others ought to feel that same way from handbook of poetic forms when i approach these poems as bucolics or eclogues berryman s craft and the poems meanings open up for me otherwise these seem banally idea driven and terribly discursive in that they re sometimes laden with private references for example the opening few lines huffy henry hid the day unappeasable henry sulked i see his point a trying to put things over the best way to enter these poems then is to embrace berryman s eclogues as a means to engaging with the main character henry because these poems are character driven the language is conversational idiosyncratic and at times pedestrian like how most of us are just plain boring in our impromptu conversations in this sense these poems have an immediacy to them the reader can almost hear henry s diatribes straight from his mouth however henry is not without pithy insight in part henry displays his humor and resign if i had to do the whole thing over again i wouldn t at times these sections begin with such intrigue they reel in the reader part begins tell it to the forest fire tell it to the moon and at times the readers are reminded of the fact that henry s merely a character in berryman s head these last two lines of part henry mastered henry tasting all the secret bits of life and that s just what we get from these dream songs bits of a berryman character in all his intricacies both commonplace and celebratory 
stunning short stories from stephen king everything s eventual us by stephen king should be required reading in all university writing courses the fourteen stories in this specific anthology are exemplary in his brief intro king asserts the short story is a dwindling art form hundreds of publications pulps digests weeklies used to feature them but few do in i agree wholeheartedly with king for each magazine that announces they ll accept short fiction again i could easily name two that ve died if short story authors aren t rewarded by paying markets the format might disappear completely and it s difficult getting an anthology published nowadays even if you re stephen king some of these stories appeared first in blood smoke legends fantasy science fiction and usa weekend very few authors have the range mr king possesses one tale herein is about a teen assassin and his employment through an illinois sub contractor that s relocated him to ohio for nefarious purposes one story is set in and revolves around a young boy that goes to fish for trout in a stream where he s then menaced by a riverbank encounter with the devil one chronicle concerns the author of a popular series of books that has hired an attorney to compel a reticent hotel manager to grant him a stay in a haunted room one story is about a married couple from new york city engaged in a bitter divorce yet another turns around a man s friendship with john dillinger and other depression era gangsters even though i appreciate all fourteen stories i m only going to tackle five i just want to tease you a little i ll begin with everything s eventual pages which is the second longest contribution king offers up this story in twenty parts marked by roman numerals which works for some reason dinky earnshaw is our protagonist one night while he s home viewing coogan s bluff dink gets a phone call from mr sharpton of transcorp when they hit it off dinky agrees to embark on a career in ohio free car free groceries free house after the corporation hones his extraordinary talent turns out dink has this weird ability to write specialized symbol laden letters that penetrate your mind killing you if you read them next up is the impressive the man in the black suit this more literary story appeared in the new yorker and later appeared in year s best fantasy horror before being reprinted here this story won first prize in the o henry best short story competition for but stephen king thought someone had made a mistake that s hard for me to believe though since this pre world war i story about the innocence of a bygone era is so vividly captured by king our protagonist here is an elderly man named gary that pens a story in his diary about the time he encountered the devil in the woods in and was scared stiff by the devil s appetite demeanor and lies spooky stuff the yarn i m going to summarize next is i ll note this in passing but this is the third story in the anthology that is hotel motel related this is significant because king exploits this device to remove his protagonists like mike enslin from the familiar placing them in transitional spaces like fish out of water if you take the numbers in and add them together you ll also notice they total in this story is a haunted room on the thirteenth floor of the hotel dolphin supposedly nobody s rented this nyc room since why s that many deaths have occurred in this particular room highly inventive concept ! i understand this will soon be a major motion picture starring john cusack unless you re a divorce lawyer you ll get a kick out of lunch at the gotham cafe this story is the real screamer of the bunch like the device used in the hotel stories king instead removes protagonist steven davis from his marriage to diane coslaw in rebellion against imminent divorce steven then decides to quit smoking during this highly stressful period in his life needless to say the combination of stress and withdrawal are heightened by the marital discord which almost knocks him off center when steven and diane are scheduled to meet for lunch at the gotham cafe in nyc with their respective attorneys steven s attorney john ring bails at the last minute family emergency disaster and hilarity soon ensue and last but not least i found the pulp tinged the death of jack hamilton to be exquisitely written our protagonist in this yarn is one homer van meter and he ll regale you with remembrances of his bank robbing days when he used to run with babyface nelson dock barker john dillinger jack hamilton red hamilton harry pierpont and a moll named rabbits you ll be laughing along with king as he narrates how homer and dillinger s crew fled a shootout in wisconsin but there s even more there s pathos ! homer was a witness to the shooting of jack hamilton he relays how they tried to save his life but ultimately failed if you read this you ll realize even low criminals have a conscience of sorts look if you pick up everything s eventual and find yourself enjoying it do yourself a favor and place stephen king s latest book or a copy of his son owen s first novella in your shopping cart on amazon com i understand stephen s publisher granted him a first printing of one million copies so there are high expectations for this particular novel it s likely to debut at on the new york times bestseller list before month s end i understand this new novel blends gothic horror marriage and romance two of these three topics being fresh territory for king since i ve read dozens of king s bestsellers i look forward to anything new he releases that might hint at variation 
i thought this would be disappointing i was wrong ! its rather nice i wasn t that impressed with the idea behind this book fashion as such doesn t really interest me or only in a historical sense anyway what has always had me wondering is why on earth the french seem to have so much style and verve seem to be the very heart of it both historically and in modern day even the terms for the most stylish of wear haute couture pret a porter and even elan are french after all it is not just style they define it is the essence of style and it is not just fasion it is food and more so i picked up this book to see if dejean could shed some light on it i expected a quick once over perhaps some fuzzing at the edges and a book designed to be read rather than giving any depth and it is none of these things it seems the french can also write with style this is a wonderful quirky book it certainly offers some convincing explanations for the french role in all things good and dejean dates it back to the reign of seventeenth century louis xiv who lived long and glamourously his quest for things to make his life brighter drier and more beautiful may well have been the starting point for this ultimate role the french have now the quest for things such as mirrors which were good a method to keep himself dry when it rained the umbrella food clothing even paving on the streets to prevent getting covered in mud dejean argues have all contributed to the way the french are now i don t know if i am that wildly convinced that a king years ago really had that great influence on the national psyche now but what i did find was the detail and the information was compelling i found myself reading this and enjoying it just for that so much i didn t know about french history so much in fasion and food i didn t know and thoroughly enjoyed learning about a good read easy page turner and while frivolous tres bon

newbies beware if this is your first suzanne brockmann novel stop ! the troubleshooters series is best read in sequence the characters are reappearing and their stories build through out the books understanding the history of the storyline is most significant in gone too far which explains the discrepancy in the previous reviews i always appreciate the characterization which ms brockmann utilizes in her stories she is a superb story teller who teases her readers with bits and pieces of stories about old and new characters this makes her series a pleasure to read for those who have traveled with her along her journey but can be frustrating and confusing to others who come in during the middle of things after reading the entire series in a frenzied month or two i personally hope to read more about sam and alyssa in the future 
a fascinating book and great fun to read over pages of diverse types of puzzles divided into chapters of similar types of questions with a humorous lengthy and explicit solution to each the author s claim that one need have no more than school certificate mathematical knowledge to be able to tackle these problems is totally beyond me apart from a few simple problems at the beginning they get progressively more and more complicated that being so the clear and detailed explanations might well be sufficient for anyone with even a modicum of ability to think logically i personally was unable to understand the vast majority of the problems or their explanations but don t let that put you off i was a mathematical failure at school and probably not who this book was intended for nevertheless i loved the book immensely and would absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend it it also contains excursions into all kinds of diverse topics and especially a lengthy and fascinating history of the arithmetical astronomical and religious considerations that make up the calculation of the date of easter delightful and mind expanding thoroughly recommended 
wonderful the book is amazing i loved mishima s language his descriptions paint such a vivid picture in one s mind the best part is his constant scrutiny of his feelings and analysis of his self 
love first i found this book to be helpful it is more for people who love a person who is currently on some form of substance it talks about intervention etc i did however find some of the chapters to be useful for dealing with a person either while it s before or after they decide to quit using their drug of choice it taught me to be patient and show lots of love 
great examination of disease and history in arno karlen s quotman and microbes quot history is approached through the relationship of disease to mankind starting with the first humans to the present this is a fascinating examination of the microscopic world s impact on the macroscopic world the origins of some diseases such as cholera the black plague and aids is covered as well as epidemics affecting only small parts of the world throughout the book it is emphasized that we could be on the brink of new pandemics the most obvious example is aids that will not only dramatically reduce population but change our world view and lifestyle modern pandemics and our responses to them are compared and contrasted to past pandemics with the resulting opinion that although we live in a technologically savvy world our reactions of fear and panic have not changed all that much my only minor criticism by the last quarter of the book is too much repetition i found my mind wandering and was a little confused by the end however i think that this is an excellent book for those interested in interdisciplinary biology and history studies

appeals on many levels part travelogue part history of the balkans and the middle east most notably part agatha christie biography the book satisfied this reader on all three levels eames sometimes tried too hard to coin meaningful metaphors but those instances were easy to overlook what wasn t easy to overlook was his mis categorization of syria as part of president bush s axis of evil which as far i know know included iran iraq and north korea it seems that would have been a relatively easy fact to check one suggestion for any future editions would be to include more maps perhaps one at the head of each chapter overall an extremely enjoyable read 
what s next when i came back to usa in from japan after years i was a little shocked it s there are so many obese i stop seeing proportionate people as i admired once before since i m from japan we were small and rather plain looking what happened ! i thought it s that soda pop as i always watch the countless gallon bottles my next customers are buying at the every grocery shopping as i was wondering this nation sued tobacco companies so i kept wondering why don t they blame major soda pop companies for obese soda pop companies are not the sole culprit but i was surprised to find that tabacco companies and sweet companies are somehow related anyhow whatever the policy that the government had or have if any failed i really hope to do something to improve american diet sooner is better i go to large oriental grocery store at least once a month you will be amazed how much size of green section they carry it s almost times of what giants or safeway carries for example 
matches cameo coat pocket nt there are many features to commend the kjv large print bible but i personally appreciate the fact that its pagination matches that of the cameo coat pocket new testament thus you do not have to become separately familiar with one bible in your personal study and another new testament to carry with you and use for memory work 
john madden writes just like he talks he even sounds excited in print ! madden clearly loves the game of football and his exuberance is evident throughout this book his stories and anecdotes from both his coaching and broadcasting days are both hilarious and insightful my own favorite part of this book were his reminisces of his days with the raiders when he coached that team to their first superbowl victory he really makes you feel like you were there 
worth reading after the other boleyn girl i have to give philippa gregory a big thank you ! for approaching this story from a different perspective from the other boleyn girl it delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of english royalty and wealth again i was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events there were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end i was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book so if you are deciding whether or not you d like to read this after having read the other boleyn girl i greatly encourage you to do so you won t regret it 
collected and worth reading through wallace stevens is one of those rare writers who had a golden touch with words wallace stevens collected poetry and prose not only brings together several collections and uncompiled poems but also selections from his journals essays and letters and in all of these he showed himself to be a thoughtful intelligent and very talented man over his lifetime stevens wrote several books of poetry but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves the lush grandeur of sunday morning the hymnlike le monocle de mon oncle and the humid grittiness of o florida venereal soil he takes multiple looks at thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird and the lush six significant landscapes in other poems stevens dips into outright surrealism like in the delicate tattoo there are filaments of your eyes on the surface of the water and in the edges of the snow and also adds a meditative bent into the snow man for the listener who listens in the snow and nothing himself beholds nothing that is not there and the nothing that is but stevens was a man of many talents there is a trio of one act plays erudite and a bit whimsical and which have his usual thoughts on art and poetry woven into some of their passages it is followed by the essay collection the necessary angel which reflects on the nature of imagination poetry art and the role of the poet in a society his uncollected prose is not so tight there are literary experiments snippets of atmospheric fiction and sprawling essays on all sorts of subjects cattle kings of florida even included are acceptance speeches and sound bites like an enlightening little nugget on walt whitman finishing up the volume is a selection from stevens notebooks ranging from puzzling poetry is a metaphor to revealing after one has abandoned a belief in god poetry is that essence which takes its place as life s redemption and finally we get his letters and journals which are friendly relaxed laid back and still show that his mind was always thinking about his art wallace stevens collected poetry and prose is probably the best way to get a full view of stevens work and his mind too his poetry gives little glimpses of his attitude toward the world and his art but his essays and journals add to that by the time you hit the final page it s hard not to feel like you know stevens if nothing else stevens writing can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful he lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote his style tends to be a bit on the ornate side stevens freely uses the more exotic terms such as opalescence pendentives and muleteers wrapped up in complex verse sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free formhis prose style isn t any less impressive stevens could lavish as much on his essays as he did in his poetry and showed that he was very good at arguing his points the last parts of the book are sprinkled with anecdotes about his travels bits of poetry and plenty of beautiful imagery the streets are blue with mist this morning wallace stevens is known for his exquisite lush poetry but the full collected poetry and prose shows just what an intelligent cultured man he was a must have 
jake bernstein trading stocks book this book has a very good trading information regarding gaps strategies and stochastics i have been looking for a while a book which explains how to trade the gaps finally found one the explanation is very strightforward and complete in addition he gives some own created stochastics strategies ie stochastics pop which are very reasonable 
great action in this one the story line is full of surprises and excellent suspense the ending isn t up to peters standards though enjoyable reading none the less 
a book that invites mental participation does cliff pickover provide an answer to humanity s questions about the nature of god absolutely not what he does in this book is much more important he encourages his readers to think for themselves by creating a series of paradoxical riddles that continuously entangle themselves in catch s pickover demonstrates how little we actually understand about a hypothetical omniscient being can we ever understand god from a human point of view i don t know but this book encourages us to at least try that in itself is a valuable gift one word of warning if you are a passive reader looking for a few hours of lazy entertainment don t buy this book however if you want mental stimulation and a nice potent cerebral workout definately read this book ! it really doesn t matter if one believes in god or not when reading this book the thought processes evoked by the book are worth the price itself 
veiled web the best of science fiction amp romantic suspense finally read veiled web and it s just wonderful the author did an incredible job showing the two religious and cultural heritages of lucia and rashid and then setting them in modern society trying to respect and understand one another s views i especially liked zaki the ai his transformation from dare i say it spoilt egocentric child to an entity with a conscience and world view was a lot of fun to read he is charming in his vulnerabilities rather than weak and despicable truly an achievement ! i would highly recommend this as a look at a culture clash and how determination can overcome bias the author deals with a lot of concerns such as quothow do we know if a machine has a soul quot in a sensitive and forthright manner without bogging down in technospeak 
wow before i read this book i was afraid to lead and would back off leads if i thought there was a chance i might fall i had led a couple s and easier routes on bolts last week i led a sustained d last month i took my first lead fall on a c and yesterday i led b as if it were no big deal the rock warrior s way has transformed my view of leading and of climbing in general and has opened up a whole new world of climbing for me thank you arno ! 
excellent commentary on an unusual play shakespeare is not my favorite author although i do understand the concept of his iambic pentameter and its style and flourishes are highly regarded while i can appreciate the labor it must take to put a story in such format i frankly find the poetics of it hard to read that makes the commentary which is about half of this version very helpful to people such as myself by reading the corresponding notes i was better able to put the story together with the style making for an exciting tale i would highly recommend this version to people who have difficulty deciphering shakespeare s style 
the classic classic that i still don t get why it s one this is another of those books that everyone tells you how wonderful and incredible it is i read it and okay it s a book and a not bad one at that but is it amazing is it the greatest most thought provoking book of all times is it truly just overrated we have a story where it s almost as though the narrarator is not the main charactor but rather her father is the story seems much more about atticus than scout but that is a matter of interpertation it s a story about racism injustice and thinking about all of that atticus is a man who goes against what the rest believes and though he fails he knows that he has succeeded by making people think about the issues they are facing so we ve covered the topic it s an interesting topic and the book itself has some wonderful parts but for the most part it drags on and on i rate this a four because i feel that it s something everyone should read if for some odd reason you didn t read it in high school whether you like it like so many others dislike it as many teenagers who are forced to read it do or merely feel that s it s okay but overrated like myself it s worth reading not just to find out where you fit but also to try to see and understand why it is much loved i myself have only just realized that everyone loves this for the fact that it tackled such social issues it s worth reading but not everyone should expect to find it a brilliant classic but rather just a good old book 
wonderful writing wolff tobias wolff writes a wonderful memoir about his experiences in vietnam his poignant writing and storytelling makes the pages in this book flow like a steady stream wolff is a masterful storyteller who captures what it was like over in vietnam during his time and skillfully brings out those adventures to the page i recommend this book along with this boys life if you are in the mood for a well writen memoir

monsters in the museum i happened to discover this book on a dusty old bookshelf in a basement the plot sounded interesting and i began reading it as an experiment i was immediately swept away preston and child have an elegant descriptive writing style reminiscient of classic leiterature even whern they re writing about a brain eating monster attacking a s wat team the action is fluid and gripping and the story itself is extremely suspenseful the ending leaps right off the page and slaps you in the face this book introduced me to preston and child and i ve since bought every single book these two have produced pick this one up it s well worth the cash 
autobiography written by a great american benjamin franklin no matter which way you look at him was a great american i love the stories and folktales about him his life and his wonderful words and sayings this autobiography of his life was written by ben franklin when he was sixty five it was written in letter format to his son and it he reminiscences about his eventfull early life throughout we see benjamin s powerful literary style and his great humour this autobiography is well worth a visit if only to get a first hand look at a very colourful historical american 
charming i fell madly totally and completely in love with the heroine of elinor lipman s the inn at lake devine natalie marx is around twelve when the short novel opens and her family has just received a politely worded rejection letter from the proprietor of the inn at lake devine there are no rooms at the inn for people with jewish names the first half of the book recounts natalie s comic attempts to visit the inn her real but limited success and the interesting people she encounters along the way the second half of the book concerns the twenty fiveyearold natalie s re introduction to the inn and her romance with the innkeepers son as always lipman s characters are quirky yet true to life they respond to real life situations in real ways yet lipman s compassionate eye for the comic shines through 
complex deep and moving story of an african farm is a difficult work to describe it must be read several times and carefully pondered before all of its secrets are unlocked ostensibly the book revolves around the lives of three children and later adults who live in the karroo plains of south africa the main focus however is on two of the characters waldo the earnest and deeply curious son of the german farmkeeper and lyndall the beautiful outspoken and rebellious orphan who suffers all her life for her ideals the book itself is semi autobiographical waldo represents schreiner s journey from fanatical childlike faith to bitter skepticism who reaches a watershed of sorts when he hisses to lyndall there is no god none lyndall on the other hand embodies schreiner s frustation with her station as a woman barred from the upper echelons of society and her inability to find a mate who is both her intellectual match and willing to accept her as an equal i want to love she whispers to the grave of waldo s father i want something great and pure to lift me to itself there are many other themes that flesh out the subtext of this extraordinary book the tragedy of solitude that ultimately all humans are alone in the cosmos dear eyes the dying lyndall whispers to her mirror they will never part us readers who expect a narrative will be dissapointed what narrative there is serves only to undersore the book s many themes often the flow of the story is out of sequence or devoid of context and deliberately so roughly the book is divided into three sections the first introduces us to the characters as children and reveals their innermost thoughts the second and shortest section is entitled times and seasons it is somewhat of a summary of what has gone before dealing mostly with waldo s journey from christian fanaticism to dispairing atheism and foreshadows some of what is to come the third and longest section covers the lives of the characters as adults and is by far the most powerful and moving piece of the book the reader who is looking for mindless action is advised to pick up the latest tom clancy novel or whatever passes for literature these days those who are willing to put aside all preconceived notions and have their cherished beliefs challenged are invited to read this book the search for truth is endless but this book is a perfect place to begin 
suspenseful eerie and of course well written i enjoyed this book more so than king s others because he doesn t spend the first pages introducing his characters he gets right to the story and devours your attention no two stories are alike it s hard to pick a favorite king develops solid characters in a short period of time and gives the reader insight as to why or how he came upon his subject matter 
complete the only basic book you ll ever need i just got the third edition of this book to put alongside my copy of the first edition which is so dog earred i may just toss it out now that i ve got the new one this is the best book i ve found for someone who wants a solid reference book that covers everything from a toz or you could say apples to zinc if you fad dieters may not find the latest gee whiz diet here but those of us who want down toearth up to date information still stick with this one 
the things they carried a memoir but also like a series of short stories which flow together seamlessly into almost a dreamlike tale it is a great read even for those of us who have no real conscept of what war is really like many hidden jewels inside well worth the read 
a wonderful novel charles frazier s cold mountain changed me as a writer he really showed me how much i need to learn mr frazier s bold use of period music throughout the novel has inspired me to reach deeper into research for my own books beyond that his careful precise use of language kept me hooked throughout the pages of this wonderful story i enjoyed the cadence and the way new words from that era captured my thinking i say new but they re really old words that have evolved or dropped from modern usage deep in the heart of this rich colorful narrative you ll find a tender love story you ll also find the land lovingly described in a rich tapestry woven together as only mr frazier seems capable of these days the war and it s brutality is described in some detail but it only serves as the backdrop to inman s struggle to return home to his true love and the country he knows and loves being a person that loves the mountains and desires a simpler life i found myself identifying with inman from the very beginning while the film was okay forget it and buy the book there is no way to translate to film what mr frazier has accomplished with the language and the music simply put i love the way he describes the sound of the music try and describe the sound of music sometime it s not easy especially the type of music described here there are many surprises in this novel but from my perspective there is no way a thinking person can read this novel and not walk away a little bit richer a little bit more fulfilled and having their view of the world altered just a tiny bit obviously i recommend this novel in my first novel only one novelist made the acknowledgements portion of my book that person is charles frazier thanks for the lessons mr frazier 
perfectly executed this book was perfectly conceived and executed these smart stories by smart women cover the whole tonal range funny poignant gut wrenching beautiful thoughtful irreverant wonderfully sappy and the publishing concept itself was brilliant a clever way to crack a difficult market strength in numbers taking power into their own hands in retrospect it seems so obvious but i m sure that two years ago these women had little idea how brilliant they were being i m years old now and anyone who has reached my stage of geezerhood knows the value of having even one good solid friend i attended a salon event these women put on in san francisco recently and i mentioned to one of them just how great i thought it would be to have twelve friends as tight as they seem to be her response well now you do and that is the feeling that one comes away with after reading their book twelve new friends

fierce ten stars anyone who has sat in class and was just bored stiff with the disjointed disconnected way of western teaching and rote memorization will love this one this is truly the missing link for those of us who have seen and read historical allegorical and sci fi epics such as anthony and cleopatra ben hur sparticus julius caesar lawrence of arabia the ten commandments the matrix samson and delilah all of the greek mythology programs jason and the argonauts hercules troy etc etc know that there was something missing from these shows and that if the avoided ingredients were placed correctly into the storylines these movies programs would have been great because they would have been correct even today if one was to look at the new sci fi shows star wars star trek deep space nine and other programs one would see ancient architecture names languages and places that is not new at all but the ancient future that has been rehashed of special interest see page and view the ancient buildings prevalent in many of the above listed shows the links of the ancient population with the current population in chapter vii the ancient languages that is still used today by the descendants of the kemetic tribes the same population found indigenous in every corner of the world the author is one of the great thinking persons of his time and this influential text should be part of everyone s library

mesmerising and honest as we watch with bated breath american troops and their iraqi proxies fight tooth and nail to take the insurgent strong hold of fallujah in iraq so i counsel all who care about what happens in this crucible to read and study carefully this magnificent book by the world s leading expert on saddam hussein first what this is not in a new foreword mr coughlin admits with admirable honesty how he was taken as a fool by the shadowy people who live in the secret world of the spies they fed him what he calls lies and he swallowed them as did others in a less exalted position no excuses there then and now mr coughlin says he wished he had known there were no weapons of mass destruction be that as it might mr coughlin argues with real logic the west had to take out saddam i take issue with him not on the why but the how surely our own elite forces aided by the british and others could have gone in quietly and done for him and his friends and family had that happened we could have avoided the mess of today that is only my viwqw it is a small objection to what is a wonderful guide to iraq well done !

a work of art thank you amazon for recommending this exquisite novel to me as a gold box special with an afterword by annie proulx and the recent success of brokeback mountain this exceptional piece of western literature should now find the audience thomas savage so richly deserved in as restrained and sparing in language as its central antagonist phil burbank savage has the uncanny gift of eloquence through omission allowing the reader to read between the lines i was captivated by his talent and jolted by an entirely unexpected but immensely satisfying conclusion this book has been five times optioned for film yet never made i doubt that will go on much longer

they bury lies don t they tempe brennan starts out her second adventure exhuming a grave at a small church tasked with identifying the bones of a nun she s just getting adjusted to the montreal weather in the middle of the night she s called onto the scene of a terrible fire that turns out to be rife with murder as tempe works on her two cases she also returns to her stateside home and continues being drawn into a macabre web featuring a cult at the same time her sister is exhibiting strange behavior after her latest divorce kathy reichs is a practicing forensic anthropologist who has somehow found the time to write bestselling fiction lately her life has also led to a television series called bones although the tempe brennan of the television show is little like the tempe brennan of reichs s novels they re both worth reading and or watching max allan collins has written a novel based on the television show i really enjoyed the forensic aspects of the novel but there were several instances where i almost felt bowled over by everything that was going on tempe s relationship with her sister hari is dead on and accurate feeling very real and very troubled however death du jour also felt hurried and too relaxed at the same time there was a lot going on but it took a while for everything to come together kathy reichs is still turning out one of the best forensic series out there and i m a fan of the television show death du jour is a fun educational read that mystery and crime scene fans will enjoy

compelling i came late to the anne heche party i loved her in volcano a schlocky movie and only recently saw her in six days seven nights which i surprisingly liked i have the hard cover version of the book which has a different cover and puts her in a more flattering light trained as a mental health professional i must say i found the book well written from the perspective of a person recovering from the appalling abuse anne suffered she is very candid and frank about the type of abuse she remembers things get a lot more murky once she s famous and she basically glosses over anne nellen that s too bad as that s why i bought the book at the bargain bin the bookstore i must say she did a lot of kooky goofy potentially dangerous and desperate things i think she missed a lot of major points about her relationship with ellen and how it related to her relationship to her mother who is atrocious however i will never look at anne heche the same way again and i will always have empathy and support to give to her for her struggle which i m sure is continuing up until this very day

you will meet a tall dark stranger when stephen king has a great idea he does not squander it many writers have tackled the concept of precognition but few have done is so masterfully the dead zone is full of thrills mayhem and wow moments while king is still getting warmed up when johnny smith wakes up from a five year coma he is endowed with the gift of second sight by touching another person or a simple item he is treated to the vision of a future event the sky is the limit with such a concept and king does not leave any piece of that sky unexplored before the midway point of the book johnny is saving people from house fires reuniting a mother and son and steering youngsters away from a horrible skating accident that has not happened yet a reader has his money s worth before this novel is half done each character is vivid and dynamic particularly those of smith and a certain politician named greg stinson the second half of the novel is no less exciting but profoundly more significant as the story unfolds tampering with the future is an endeavor fraught with peril as any fan of physics can tell you johnny is confronted by such a challenge forced to choose between accepting the fate of the world or embracing his gift and using it to change the future there is a serial killer to sniff out and even that is not as vital as his next step which involves a truly demented man who will one day be president the finally act of the book can be summarized by the question if you could go back and time knowing what you know about adolph hitler would you kill him its a fun question to ask at parties for john smith and his dubious extrasensory abilitiy it s one big cross to bear the dead zone is one of those books that will be studied for generations but forget the acadamia for now it s a must read novel for fans of almost any genre and a perfect choice for those rare birds who need an introduction to stephen king

the dimensional translation brought to life philosophers scholars and other intellectuals have tried countless times to translate lao tzu s tao te ching there are so many translations and commentaries however all of these other translations provide a linear comprehension of the tao te ching linear meaning the knowledge derived is thought to be of ideological value reason being that all these philosophers scholars and other intellectuals are not masters of the tao and hence they conject based on their inadequate level of realization hence providing the linear incorrect and missing the point translation master liao being a grandmaster of the tao has given the dimensional and applicable translation of the tao te ching i m a taiji gong practitioner and through my own meditative experiences i can understand and apply the tao te ching as translated by master waysun liao if i may paraphrase to help others understand the tao and the te is analogous to part and parcel of the whole te being part and tao being the whole this dimensional aspect that interaction of the te and the tao is what master liao elaborates on in nine nights with the taoist master i highly recommend this book for anyone studying the tao i hope this book becomes widely known as a great translation for the tao te ching because its standard is higher then intellectual 
sobering debate why is there terrorism in the world today alan dershowitz speculates the reason can be found in the world s reaction to terrorism in the past he claims the appeasing nature of the european nations when faced with the terrorist acts of yassir arafat s plo and other palestinian groups from to convinced the islamic extremists that terrorism indeed achieved its desired results and is therefore a popular device used today dershowitz details the history of terrorism going back to ancient times but he focuses primarily on the terrorism began by palestinians in and continuing to this day with the exception of the united states and israel each country victimized by arafat s terroristic acts eventually caved to him met his demands and eventually recognized his cause countries like germany france and italy are dershowitz s favorite targets as he contends the leaders of those countries acted exclusively with self interest failing to consider the incentive they were giving to the terrorists to commit harsher and more creative crimes in the future dershowitz asks why would terrorists stop terrorizing when not only were they not punished for their crimes but they were also rewarded with exposure and support we all know about the olympic killings in munich but how many people know that germany released three of the murderers involved shortly after their arrest according to dershowitz the actions of european countries from made the september th attacks inevitable they received no penalty for similar crimes in the past and actually received incentive so why not do it even though dershowitz is not usually a fan of the politics of george w bush see his book on the election of he sees the overwhelming response by bush after as the proper action for any nation victimized by terrorism whereas dershowitz believes the european nations encourage future terrorist acts with their actions bush s effort to strike back with sever and precise force is the right thing to do dershowitz goes on to discuss scenarios in which torture would be morally acceptable when fighting terrorism many people will ask if this is the same alan dershowitz who has made a career out of being one of the top civil liberties attorneys in the world yes it is even though he puts a deep importance on civil liberties he also believes the safety of the world takes precedence dershowitz has spent years developing his theories on when the safety of the masses trumps the liberties of some most of his counterparts prefer to bury their heads in the sand on this issue unable to face the reality that sometimes liberty must be sacrificed for the betterment of society dershowitz keeps coming back to two important events first he uses a quote by george w bush after the beheading of daniel pearl in which bush says terrorists must understand that these types of acts only hurt their cause dershowitz shows how terrorists have not believed that in the past when their crimes were directed at most of the world excluding the usa and israel dershowitzs second favorite event to discuss is the pre incarceration of zacharias massaoui and civil liberty laws that tied the hands of the authorities who had him in custody he claims this is a close real world example of the ticking time bomb scenario many philosophers and leaders have debated for centuries what tactics are you willing to take to get information from someone who knows of a catastrophic event but will not discuss it dershowitzs solutions point to a man who truly is concerned with protecting the constitutional rights of the individual and abiding by the laws of the geneva convention but who is also concerned with avoiding the naive policies of most civil libertarians who would rather protect the rights of one man than to save the lives of thousands even those who disagree with him on certain issues will see a debate master at work rarely are arguments more focused more passionate better researched or more convincing a must read for anyone interested in understanding global terrorism

a wholistic view of healing thoughtful and original this is probably the best work on healing i have read so far i am now on my third reading and it will not be the last as there is so much in this book to chew on whitmont who was born in the early part of the century is if he s still alive an m d and psychotherapist and also well versed in homeopathy alchemy chaos theory the theories of rupert sheldrake and david bohm and many other topics such as art literature and drama he has a truly broad intellect as well as a highly developed intuitive sense i would say his ideas are firmly within the humanist tradition without any new age leanings indeed he shows that in healing darkness is just as important as quotthe light quotfor the darkness is where one goes to mine the gold of the deepest human experiences he does not approach the causes of illness from the standpoint so prevalent today of quotwe cause our illnesses by not dealing with our emotional or soul issues quotrather he points out that illness as well as all phenomena proceeds from a deeper level of reality whose patterns are not readily discernible or understandable when viewed from the three dimensional reality we inhabit although i cannot summarize the book well because it contains so much i would say that his basic stance is that everything of the visible world is rooted in an invisible reality an quotimplicate order quot to quote physicist david bohm and that in healing we must take that implicate order into consideration just as much as we do the physical reality of the illness his way of doing this takes up a good part of the second portion of the book the first portion explains his way of looking at man reality and the universe with an interesting first chapter on homeopathy i highly recommend this book to any healer whether you are a nurse physician psychotherapist energy healer somatics practitioner whatever its not necessarily an easy read but it will open up many dimensions of the healing process to you

where are you tonight sweet marie this was the first serious modern work on alchemy that i ve read and boy did i luck out ! it is a work charged with authenticity and vision von franz gives you some historical background on the origins of alchemy then introduces this th century alchemist gerhard dorn and his inner and outer struggle to illuminate and heal the schism between spiritual alchemy and western christianity dorn doesn t come to any happy conclusions but the chapter on medieval magic is worth the entire read it includes a serious attempt to examine the question of evil oh thank you ! and the historical process of projecting the contents of the psyche onto some aspect of the body also an inspiring section on the cloud as symbol in alchemy and christian mysticism for the confusing and darkening part of a person s journey inward to her own core also peppered throughout are juicy tidbits about things like necromancy pyromancy hydromancy and something jung himself was into for a while called geomancy which she explains in a brief but fascinating aside the book is developed from transcripts of a lecture she gave in zurich at the jung institute it reads like a lecture with the rythmns and addendums of the spoken word mostly intact but obviously translated that s ok it flows like pure gold and is a great window into this whole zurich scene and the living body of work that von franz and jung together embodied this little work is bound to inspire and fuel some aspect of your own imagination enjoy 
very satisfied with the contents if you read the editorial review it is stated that the book is about installing and configuring oracle database g on linux yes the author did explain clearly the process of installing and configuring the oracle g on linux he also covered a few more topics such as ha high availability tuning sql rac replication index and partitioning but not in depth but the coverage is acceptable and useful do buy this book and you will find it useful if you love oracle dbms running on linux platform

please someone take down donna di giacomo s review roland topor s book about city life alienation is one of the most brilliant pieces of horror i ve read in some time while reading it i couldn t help it but find some parallels between topor s book and thomas ligotti s own my work is not yet done ligotti himself also happens to write a great introduction to this book s main course focusing on the differences between pessimistic receivers of the novel prize for literature and the real pessimist writers that go unnoticed also included is a selection of four previously unpublished short stories and a brief gallery representative or roland topor s ink drawings but please don t read donna di giacomo s review on this page i have no idea what she was thinking while writing it but she pretty much fills it with spoilers for of the novel laying there for any unsuspecting readers to find and i have no idea why the amazon staff that usually checks these reviews before public viewing gave it the green light fortunately for me i finished the book long before finding that spoiling wreck but others might not be that lucky and this is a very good book to have it mercilessly ruined like that 
great work no book has ever influenced me as this book by dr covey i think dr covey is the newton of human behavior apples were falling from the trees but it was newton who discovered the law of gravity similarly the habits are common sense but dr covey has beautifully knitted these habits i bet most of us follow most of these habits reading this book reinforces the existing principals that we have teaches us about the missing links in our life how many times have we been told about the goose the golden egg story did any body think that even our resources in life business are like that goose we have to take care about the well being of our resources the best thing about this book is that it redirects your priorities often we neglect our physical health our family and our community obligations i recommend reading the th habit because it comes with a dvd which is treasure of new thoughts 
a lexicon fit for years of study this lexicon is invaluable for doing greek word studies as a layman struggling to teach myself greek i find it a great place from which to launch my greek word studies it contains more than references to classical intertestamental early christian and modern literature this edition contains more elaborate definitions of greek terms than other lexicons i have seen the benefit of these to me is that it helps give me a fuller sense of the word being studied and helps me to avoid anachronisms there is no doubt in my mind that this is the lexicon for serious greek students 
surprised by how fantastic this book is when i saw that this book was written in i wasn t expecting much koontz is a great writer but i figured this was just around the time period that he was still finding himself as a writer what i discovered in this book was a style of writing that isn t common in any other koontz book which certainly isn t a bad thing a lot of time koontz doesn t deviate far from a particular formula but this book bears no resemblence to anything he has ever written and it is a pleasant surprise highly recommended for those who need a break from reading koontz s recent novels

very enjoyable and helpful reading on nonviolence i had two misgivings about this book before i began to read it both of my misgivings turned out to be unfounded the first one was that since i have read my fair share of nonviolence books i feared that it would all be repetition cortright starts the book with mohandas gandhi and martin luther king but not with the ordinary biographical stories of their lives rather he uses them as vehicles to explain the secret of nonviolence together with today s scholars and his own opinions it works very well and even though gandhi and king are familiar to me i learned a lot especially in a later chapter were he writes about gandhi s and king s views on gender and sexuality the second misgiving was the subtitle which made me hesitate if i would buy it or not nonviolence for an age of terrorism i was afraid that this was another american too hung up on terrorism like terrorism was the biggest problem humans face today as a swede living in a country who has not been struck by terrorism or taken part in the war on terrorism it might be more difficult for me to understand why terrorism is seen as the biggest problem in the world when tens of thousands of people are dying every day of poverty actually the book doesn t talk very much about terrorism but poses an important challenge to nonviolent activists if we want to stop the war on terror we ought to be able to provide a better solution to the problem of terrorism than the military does i have been racking my brain on how we can be more effective in our nonviolent campaigns this book gave me a lot of food for thought on the subject but unlike strategists like gene sharp cortright doesn t limit nonviolence to its effectiveness he sees nonviolence not just as a method but as a way of life he tells about his struggles and his times of doubts about the ideas of nonviolence my respect and admiration for the author rose after i understood how much involved he has been for many decades and still is in the peace movement here is a man who not only teaches and writes about gandhi and king but actually tries to use their methods in his life he manages to combines the learnings of the history of nonviolence with the nonviolent movement of today a potent combination that we need more of i am sure military analysts sit day in and day out trying to analyze yesterday s battles to learn how to fight more effectively tomorrow we nonviolent activists have something to learn from the military in that sense cortright s book really highlights the importance of making this analysis and to learn from our mistakes the book gives a refreshing criticism of our nonviolent icons i had heard negative rumours about gandhi and king but was unsure if they were true according to this book some of them were and some were not but cortright makes a more important point you can admire one part of a human s life like gandhi s nonviolent struggle against the british occupation while at the same time be deeply critical to another part of the same person s life like gandhi s warped views on gender and sexuality cortright rightly points out that we should not expect flawless leaders talking about leaders i have been embarrassed to keep coming with nothing but male nonviolent role models in my nonviolent workshops so i was happy to find two great female role models in this book dorothy day and barbara deming two women who really deserve more appreciation for their contributions in the nonviolence struggle in the end of the book cortright gives us some practical tools to use in the nonviolent struggle were he emphasizes the importance of setting up concrete and achievable goals and warning us from disregarding the importance of fund raising and working effectively with the media he also encourages us to try new creative and some times more risky nonviolence methods not always the petitions demonstrations but also boycotts strikes blockades and sit ins these types of methods have proved to be the most effective in the nonviolence movement according to the author we who work for peace and justice face incredible challenges it is easy to get discouraged when you see what you are up against cortright gives us hope in spite of this he shows many examples of how nonviolence has made fantastic gains the last decades there have been victories even in the cases were it seemed we failed and it takes time some times a very long time to change for the better what we need in the struggle is persistence and hope according to cortright both these traits have grown stronger in me while reading this book martin smedjeback 
stop the presses call william boot the forrest gump of the s oblivious to the process he is a part of he continually finds himself in the right place at the right time blindly stumbling onto the big story that made him a reluctant hero in scoop evelyn waugh one of the most famous curmudgeons of english literature produces an enjoyable and easy toread satire that will recall the novels of p g wodehouse and graham greene s lighter efforts in the book mr waugh points his razor wit toward the media royalty politics warfare and travel all in the context of a fictional and fanciful war in the made up republic of ishmaelia that is based on italy s ill fated war in abyssinia now ethiopia which mr waugh himself covered as a young reporter his sharpest barbs are saved for his one time profession which he paints as being populated by lazy and back stabbing prima donnas incapable of independent thought and more interested in style or at least the appearance of style than in substance the bland boot the story s protagonist who is a decent enough fellow but a hopeless journalist manages to get far closer to the truth than any of his colleagues but does so only by chance though the attitudes language and practices described in scoop are more than a little dated there is an element of truth in the picture mr waugh paints of the fourth estate as sad cases like the contemporary one involving one time new york times rising star jayson blair remind us the descriptions are however greatly exaggerated it is impossible to imagine a time when writers were sent into the field so poorly prepared with unlimited expense accounts and rewarded for sending in cryptic messages that are somehow turned into massive front page reports there is a slight element of sour grapes in mr waugh s description of the newsgathering field he failed to excel in something most obvious from the names he chooses for the fictional newspapers in the story the daily beast the daily brute etc more importantly like most popular satires scoop is really less about its subject matter than about comforting those who don t move in the same circles as the rich and powerful the book dismantles between its covers remember that these are the same people who were expected to buy this book when it was published in even critics at that time recognized this in an as amatteroffact way referring to scoop as a comedy of errors mr waugh dashed off to pay the bills between more weighty projects but the most serious flaw of the book concerns the way the main character boot evolves or fails to evolve characters are the cornerstone of any great story and even with a farce like scoop compare boot to the bumbling wormold in mr greene s our man in havana another satire produced by a serious writer on a lark the story is dramatically improved by illustrating the evolution of characters over the length of the narrative but in scoop boot returns home just the same as when he left all of the characters in fact fail to change at all during the course of the story with the possible exception of the compelling and shadowy russian hungarianpole cum german love interest ktchen not the best possible work from an author known for producing noteworthy personalities in his more noteworthy novels like decline and fall and brideshead revisited 
alas ! a woman to rape a man don t get me wrong i am very much fed up on reading stories that heroines suffer the most well the heroine here did suffer the most but at least in raping issues she got the first score imagining those scenes will heat you up don t laugh well i condemn rape strongly no doubt about it it was just i prefer this jl book than her others that also contains rape scenes i personally didn t like her a pirate s love for that really depicted how women are so low and degradable read it and you will know what i am saying at least in here you could be proud of what rowena did well not most of it but she did fight i also didn t like how warrick still punished her after days of retribution a like for a like it seems he get the most bargain between the two of them to sum it up the literature is good i cried some of its scenes hate the rape and forcing a woman who rapes a man definitely a sexy and perverse thing but still not a good thing hey ! i want to clear out that she was just forced by her vile stepbrother who turns out at the end of the story to become warrick s vassal after saving her from falling from the roof geez 
two part harmony a useful critical book i am the author i am unwilling to rate the book but thought less than stars would show a lack of self confidence the book is out as of june from georgetown university press

the analects of patton axelrod gleans patton s speeches and writings to distill what he believed to be patton s philosophy of leadership he also includes a few memoirs of patton by those who knew him personally axelrod sets out each anecdote or saying in boldface and then gives a brief commentary on what he believes patton meant by the statement for the most part the commentaries are superfluous you could completely dispense with them except for the fact that they sometimes contain additional statements by and anecdotes about patton patton emerges as a talented but flawed leader contrary to his reputation as quotold blood and guts quot he was a humane commander who truly cared for the welfare of his troops his statement that he d rather waste ammunition than lives pretty well sums it up the book is well organized entertaining and informative on the subjects of both leadership and military history 
i actually became smarter after reading this book the book offers a very broad and seemingly unrelated range of information you read familiarize yourself with the theory of what is done in the field and afterwards it is very easy to apply the quite interesting information gotten from this book inevitably you would require some more practical not necessarily detailed information pertaining to more advanced projects in this case you will at least know what you are looking for and manage the time and project in a more professional manner 
men of principle even if it kills them this book reads a little bit like a precursor to the novels of ayn rand a group of men espouse almost impossible ideals and then try to live up to them at any cost or in this case kill or die for them the title refers to a group of well educated idealists at the turn of the century who are contract murderers but only if they agree that the murder is morally justified a potential client visits them and offers a contract to kill the head of their agency strangely the executive ivan dragomiloff finds this to be justified sends out the order for his own death and then spends the rest of the book in a deadly cat andmouse game with the men he has trained so well this book was made into an entertaining but not very deep movie around starring oliver reed telly savalas and diana rigg

a must have for beginners this is the one and only book i learned the tarot from many moons ago this was in fact the only book to learn from for many years i imagine this classic in the hands of anyone beginning to go through the basic meanings of the standard rider waite images this is the basis of most other packs the meanings can also be applied to the marseille deck i do not advise one to begin with this system as the minors are not illustrated the contents give an overview of the basic history up to the s of the history of the cards the astrology information was very helpful numerology was ok i have never been a big fan of numerolgy for i personally feel is to be too simplistic as for the quaballa this goes right over my head and always will maybe someday i will take an interest in this i would probably start with this book some of the information is a bit dated but i am sure this perennial favorite will be relevant for many generations to come if you plan on seriously studying the cards i could not think of a better place to begin ! 
precise observation of nature published in this book contains page length poems selected by the author you don t read these poems to get a story line but rather a feeling of place with ammons its the precise observation of nature quotbees stopped on the rock quot or a quotsnow log quot there are also mirrors of the self quotof a life that did become quot in the poem easter morning in some ways he is a modern transcendentalist looking at nature observing carefully and looking even deeper i recommend this book to anyone and its a good introduction to ammons 
america is beautiful america is by far the best portrayal of a young person trapped in society s system of foster care that i have ever seen the book may be too real for some but not if you are a realist americas battle to understand who he is in this world is an exhiliratingly sad ride that alerts readers to a child welfare system that is overworked and understaffed america actually gets lost in the system which is symbolic of the thousands of american children who are ignored and lost everyday in our country s protection services america reminds us that our children need more than just parents to raise and watch out for them our children need other adults teachers coaches counselors neighbors and general role models to look out for our youth and set a positive example for them all of those commercials that ask for communities to take a second to get to know their youth are not for those of us who already do that even if you chose not to have kids our country was not built on the attitude of its not my responsibility i love america symbolically literally and on so many levels i can t even put it into words america is beautiful if this book doesn t touch your emotions then you are not human this book is raw real and heartbreakingly intriguing thank you e r frank for an expertly written young adult novel

much more of a book than i ever thought my wife and i recently read this book to our young children neither of us had ever read it as children our children loved hearing the story of the real bambi and were sad on the nights we were unable to read to them from it bambi was written not just for children and when you understand the author was a jew who fled nazi persecution in early th century europe it gives you a better understanding of and appreciation for the underlying tones it should also be noted that this book was banned by the nazis because the author s ancestry so you may enjoy reading a banned book both for you and or your child our children loved the story although some of the material is a little violent for very small children our children were able to deal with it okay the story contains much more than just childrens themes such as growing up and becoming independent it also has the theme of equality and not ever thinking of oneself as inferior to others just because they might have more power than you or your group i am very grateful that my wife and i were able to read this to our children and share the experience with them i was also grateful to learn about the author and what he went through in his lifetime it is a book that you should most definitely consider sharing with your child children

a must for hitchcock fans daniel spoto is well known for his fascinating biography of alfred hitchcock the art of alfred hitchcock fleshes out the master every bit as much as the biography but in a different way what makes this book a must for hitchcock fans and in particular those interested in studying his mastery of the film craft is that spoto bolstered by many interview hours with hitchcock is able to get inside a creative film genius mind and give us an idea of how he explored his basic themes as well as the manner in which he manipulated audiences through exploiting his unique brand of suspense spoto also gives us a look into the technical side of the master film craftsman letting us know how he kept audiences mesmerized with compelling scenes such as the killing of janet leigh in psycho and those incredible special effects in the birds in which it appeared that the winged creatures were about to lay total siege to the previously serene northern california town of bodega bay in addition to what he actually did donald spoto is also to be commended for something he did not do in so many retrospectives of film greats be they directors or performers authors believe in devoting an equal or relatively equal amount of space to every movie with which they were involved thankfully spoto did not do this devoting greater attention to the classic hitchcock movies that generated the most discussion among filmgoers and cinema historians not surprisingly for those who have studied hitchcock s films spoto regards vertigo starring james stewart and kim novak as hitchcock s most complete and artistic work and explains why providing excellent insight into the film in the process another film that continues generating widespread praise in the hitchcock oeuvre for its technical genius and inventive plot and characterization is notorious starring the dynamite team of cary grant and ingrid bergman spoto covers this screen classic with comprehensive scrutiny spoto covers the wide sweep of hitchcock s career we move from his beginnings in london in silent films and are finally transported to hollywood and hitchcock s impressive debut for producer david o selznick with rebecca

one of my very favorite children s books oh how i wanted to be elizabeth ann when i was little and first read this book ! first of all i thought that elizabeth ann was far and away the most beautiful name i had ever heard in my entire life and i definately identified with the dull suburban upbringing though perhaps my parents weren t quite so hypochondriatic how i wished that some distant relatives with a farm would suddenly appear and take me away so that i could eat maple sugar candy and learn how to churn butter and rescue kittens and go to a one room school house twenty years after i first discovered this book it is still one of my favorites written by a leading advocate for montessori style teaching this book empahises the importantes of self reliance and self teaching although i recognize the moralizing now that i m a grown up i never felt it when i was a kid and simply delighted in reading over and over and over again about the adventures of betsy and her eccentric vermont relatives 
great story that is little known as an industry insider worked for malcom mclean from to its great to see that the story of the development of the container and its amazing economic impact has been recognized the container along with the jet plane and advanced communications are the three major innovations that have made the world a smaller place and permitted globalization for all its benefits and shortcomings i would prefer to see more of the business economic facts covered including the economics of a successful container line today the coverage of united states lines in chapter is too superficial and could be expanded overall a great attempt to cover the history of the container industry

great collection great collection of success literature i especially enjoyed acres of diamonds russell conwell s book acres of diamonds was developed from a speech he delivered to church congregations over times the proceeds he earned from this speech are reputed to have given him a fortune which he used to found temple university in philadelphia acres of diamonds is the story of a successful farmer in india named al hafed hafed is tempted by the allure of wealth and sells his farm to search the world for diamonds years later he dies penniless having not found diamonds however back home the man who purchased hafed s farm accidentally discovers a huge field of diamonds on hafed s former land conwell uses this story to illustrate that success often lies close at hand if you are willing to open your eyes and mind to opportunity conwell further suggests that most people are pygmies of their possible selves rarely achieving the potential of their innate abilities or local opportunities conwell also discusses his basic philosophy of business and gives several rules or suggestions for budding entrepreneurs the seeds of fortune are close at hand stick with what you know find your niche and don t be swayed by the allure of greener pastures find out what people want and fill that need this sounds obvious but many entrepreneurs start with a product or service and then try to find a market for their product or service conwell advises finding the market first then developing a product or service to meet that demand make the best possible product and provide them to a large number of people acres of diamonds was first published in it is still valid today and provides valuable lessons to anyone attempting to achieve financial success you may also want to read think and grow rich by napoleon hill and the principles of creating wealth by phillip collinsowrth 
still deciding i just started reading this today it is hard for a non mba to review the book being that my only understanding of what goes on in mba halls is based on my friend s stories and the plethora of business books i ve read however i can say that the book covers most of the topics being discussed in classrooms today what i find most convinient is the ease with which the authors handle the business language furthermore the book is tightly organized starting out with a basic review of macro micro economics i think even someone just looking for a basic understanding of business and economic phenomena will take away a lot from this book 
personal stories i live on the edge of a town miles from the mexican border where it is not uncommon to see groups of udas running down the street to a safe house or piling into a coyote s car and border patrol helicopters buzzing overhead but this book gave personal insight into who some of these people actually are how they survive here if they make it beyond the check points and a glimpse of the life they leave in mexico and why i could not put this book down and was glad ted was able to tell the story to those of us who would not hear it otherwise very readable 
life changing i just refered about people to this book in the past week so i figured i should add a review here also this book is really and truly life changing there is something about the words and the way its written that you can t put it down until you re finished reading it and there s an overwhelming sense of peace that comes over everyone who reads and finishes it it is short to the point and really inspirational i keep a copy on my bedside table and open it almost every day to find the nearest highlighted quote to give me energy since i have read this book and his other books also i have seriously changed my life for the better it is so simple to do you realize the power of peaeful and mindful living and how easy it is to do

feeling alone in the arene of orm i am a proud owner of visio for enterprise architects the only case tool i own and i ve have also purchased and used t halpins text regarding the use if this tool in this text terry goes thru great efforts to promote the use of object role modeling orm in conceptual designs i am somewhat sceptical about why there no other book or author using orm in their explanations of conceptual designs i whish i had k to purchase a copy of erwin so i could be in the main stream i also contacted microsoft and asked if they were enhancing visio for enterprise architects in visual studio they told me that it will still ship with it but that there are no changes to accommodate sql server my feeling is that i ve joined the ranks of the lone ranger 
in a word fantastic this is one of those books that i ve known about and heard about and been told about and has been recommended to me countless times over the short span of my life i remember one such recommendation in particular from fr miguel my spiritual director at the time he saw in me an immense love for philosophy and wholeheartedly recommended that i read the book in fact one of our first projects was to watch the movie although we couldn t find a copy of it available anywhere this past christmas time was that time when i finally endeavored to obtain a copy of the book in review here one of my bosses at work gave me a gift card for christmas to borders i utilized it quite well purchasing the karamazov brothers and a collection of novels and short stories by flannery o connor trust me when i say that the purchase was emphatically worth it for starters i almost didn t buy this edition simply because it was titled karamazov brothers instead of what i d heard my entire life from my youngest days too watch the cartoon an american tale with the beloved mousekewitz family and their son fivel when asked what his favorite book is fivel names the book in review namely brothers karamazov i bought the edition nontheless precisely because it was published by oxford university and i knew them to be a fabulous publisher beginning to read a book the size of karamazov is tough due to its sheer length indeed it is the longest book apart from the bible that i have ever read but as i am fond of telling people it is the best damn novel i have ever read i work a full time job thus don t have a whole lot of expendable time thus it took me two months to read this book those two months were however two of my most memorable ive not read anything else by dostoyevski so i m not sure if he s this good in his other stories but he was a sheer genius at character development i simply cannot emphasize that point enough the characters introduced throughout the or so pages were developed and described so splendiferously that i felt as if i were being introduced to real people the whole scenario surrounding the murder was so realistically told that despite the fact that i am quite able to stomach immensley violent movies such as saving private ryan and the passion of the christ this book made me shudder as i read the pages paragraphs sentences and words describing the murder that is in some sense the centerpiece of this beloved novel even the peripheral characters those that are well quite random and only in a few chapters but developed oh sowell strike me as being as real as my roommates simply due to the ill say it again sheer genius of the author unless if one is completely philosophically inept they notice that this book is much more than just a murder mystery of sorts this book struck me almost as being a philosophical treatise against nihilism in fact a dear friend of mine told me that he s heard of dostoyevski referred to as the christian nietzsche the same friend of mine an avid dostoyevski reader said that he read that nietzsche in fact took the time read dostoyevski s novels i can t help but wonder what he thought as he read these novels that unabashedly attacked the very philosophy that he pontificated over andover in his works to close i first apologize for my rambling and lack of direction in this review there is just so much to be said in regards to this great book and i lack the time to address each and every thing in it that made it what it is great thus i close by wholeheartedly recommending this book to any and all god bless cocamojo 
excellent there are two plots to this story sylvia compson s search for her mother s quilts which sylvia s sister had sold and the story of eleanor sylvia s mother it needs to be remembered that the audience gets to learn about eleanor but sylvia is not reading a journal by her mother or in any way learning what we as the readers now know about her mother s life some of it sylvia is able to piece together in the book but the majority of it only we as the readers know it gives us insight and understanding that sylvia does not have it also gave me more understanding of the rift between sylvia and her sister claudia i think this was a very good writing device one thing i ve noticed about chiaverini s writing is that she is not afraid to introduce new characters or change our opinions even slightly about existing and continuing characters she is not afraid to let some characters move on as they would in real life for me that is what makes these books so interesting so valid and so real people move on people change careers divorce marry move away try new things and sometimes stay in the same job and the same area it s life i think chiaverini s books mirror life the hunt for the quilts was painful in a way for me my own family has been searching for family quilts that disappeared during the funeral of my great grandmother i think this is a very truthful portrayal of how disheartening it is too to work so hard on any needlework craft including quilting and those who don t appreciate or understand the enormous amount of time patience creativiity and work that goes into it just letting the dog lie on it or giving it away or selling it yep i ve seen all of those in real life happen and it breaks the heart it also makes me decide nope i am not giving that person any more of my needlework too bad for them the adult children of andrew seemed like an accurate and possible portrayal to me i m sorry to say it but weddings and funerals bring out the worst at times in a saint i ve seen people who are normally rational kind hearted dear people go into anger and say and do things that are shocking you realize that you didn t really know that person after all for those who say the reaction of the adult children was not creditable i can only say that for me it sure was i ve seen really decent kind people who go to church and do the right things in life and are law abiding citizens do and say some really crazy out ofcharacter nutty things when it comes to marriage or funerals or more to the point who is getting what in a will if you haven t experienced it my bet is that someday unfortunately you ll find that you will itll never happen in my family are famous last words and that s what this book is and what all of chiaverini s books are for me honest honesty doesn t mean a perfectly happy ending if it was perfectly happy all of the quilts would never have been sold in the first place or if they had been all of them would have been found and in pristine condition i really enjoyed this book 
this book is my new bible this book is a must read for anyone who has lived through being a high performer at work and been shafted at raise time for not being a team player any hr manager anyone in management and anyone in general in the workplace needs to read this book lots of new content and food for thought here but also very cathartic for those dogged by corporate american process for process sake john puts into very simple and powerful concepts even corporate common sense things that i have found myself muttering under my breath for years john s concepts would engender a competitive and productive american workforce and a truly free job market where talent and skill are rewarded and the pencil pushers and clock watchers and bad managers are moved on i long for the day killer book must read buy it now 
the best book of its type around this is a superb book i am reluctantly parting with a copy on ebay couk now this really is a unique work 
more relevant today than ever reading tuchman these days she seems eerily prophetic the war in iraq is classic folly the pursuit of policy contrary to a nation s self interest the leaders of the u s would do well to study it carefully the book is for college level readers it s not easy stuff however it is well worth the effort there are so many classic lines in this book ! a sampling of some of my favorites mankind it seems makes a poorer performance of government than of almost any other human activity no experience of the failure of his policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence said of philip ii of spain but it fits george w bush to a t folly in one of its aspects is the obstinate attachment to a disserviceable goal the wars of the league of cambrai over the next five years exhibit all the logical consistency of opera librettos it should not be supposed that honor and dignity are better served by persisting in a wrong measure once entered into than by rectifying an error as soon as it is discovered from benjamin franklin in the search for meaning we must not forget that the gods or god for that matter are a concept of the human mind they are the creatures of man not vice versa as tuchman points out folly does not consist only in going ahead with pointless wars tuchman also calls it folly when we insist on economic growth when such growth is demonstrably using up the basics of life on our planet i agree ! tuchman doesn t mention social security or medicare and their runaway costs but the inability to address these programs rationally looks like folly to me do we really want it said of our age after us the deluge 
excellent white or black i really liked the book it was informative where the others where not i just don t understand why it is focused on black women everything i read applies to any expected mother 
good and not so good i read this book about years ago but when i picked it up again i didn t remember a thing about it except that back then i didn t like it i liked it this time but found the writing pretentious why should i read entire paragraphs without understanding them when i have read understood and enjoyed other difficult books from tolstoy to bellow to atwood maybe the problem is that this is british from an unfamiliar era oh well i didn t really like any of the characters caro was cold grace a whimp christian self involved ted a martyr paul egocentric the protraits of minor characters such as caro s fellow office workers were the best part of the book the plot was nothing much and the end well did they live happily ever after or not i couldn t figure it out but it did keep my attention and entertain me for a week not all that bad 
we ve got a winner what a nice little book for kids no big bad wolves no mean kids no mean grown ups no one is abandoned or lost no name callingwhat a nice little book for grown ups with new yorker artist ian falconer s kindhearted eye catching illustrations and perceptive humor that really feels like one parent talking to another although i guess the character is modeled on his niece actually just a cute portrayal of a happy little girl highlighting some of the universal qualities found in happy little girls olivia likes to dance her mother let s her know that she loves her but is worn out by the end of a day with her olivia likes to go to the beach she builds sand castles she goes to the art museum and thinks about the paintings she likes she gets in a little trouble trying to make her own home pollock mural she likes having books read to her at bedtime and enters intense negotiations concerning the appropriate number of books i see that there are some sequels out i m a little nervous about checking them out whenever i see a kids book i like it seems to be followed up by sequels that don t live up to mark set by the original but we ll see what i enjoyed most about this book is that it is an easy book for a parent to read in an interactive way there are lots of opportunities to ask questions what do you think olivia thinking in this picture how are you like olivia how are you different and so on big thumbs up 
the best drama i ve ever read i thought gentlemen prefer blondes was a great book most books that are made into movies are not as good as the movie version but i actually thought this book was a little bit better i thought the book had great details to let you see what was going on this book is set in a diary form and is narrated by lorelie a beautiful woman who loves diamonds and can trick men into buying them for her i liked the diary form because this helped you know when everything was taking place you can also really tell what kind of person lorelei is just by the way the book is written this book is like a big soap opera lorelei and dorothy are always trying to trick someone into buying them something they charm one man and then make him promises that they will come back and go on to the next that is what makes you want to keep on reading the fact that you don t know who they are going to trick next this book is one of the best books i ve read anita loos does a wonderful job throughout the whole book describing lorelei and dorothy s adventures it s just like watching a movie in your head if anyone wants to learn how to get what you want from a man i suggest taking some tips from lorelei and reading this book 
son inlaw hard to buy for son inlaw keeps this book handy for re reading chapters was happy he is enjoying it hope it helps his golf game 
another great read better than last few first i am a fan of ann rule i feel she handles her genre expertly with the past few crime files books however i found myself becoming a little disappointed although i still enjoyed her books i felt that too much time was spent on the detectives yes i am sure that her police background makes her partial and i found that old cases were being written about without any new information added along came this book and i purchased it expecting to be entertained but not expecting the book to be up to ms rule s usual standard well this book surprised me i thoroughly enjoyed the five stories in this volume and i will now look at the next in the crime files a bit differently and without skepticism i feel like this is a worthy book and not one that the publisher was in a hurry to get out there in order to make a buck whether you are new to ann s book or someone who has read everything she has written you will enjoy this book

beautiful language and art highly highly recommended it s rare that a children s book comes along where both the artwork and the language reach the heights offered up by fletcher and the falling leaves the story s premise a young fox attempts to protect his favorite tree from the encroachment of autumn trying in vain to keep it leaved literally to the last leaf could have easily become overly sentimental and cloying instead there is a true sense of sadness and empathy leavened by some wonderfully quirky moments all of which lead to a close that is as satisfying as it is moving as it is the story could certainly have stood on its own for plot alone regardless of language or art but the artwork is simply sensational the impressionistic watercolors perfectly matching each page s tone and sentiment matching the movement of time through day and night from fall to winter culminating in perfect pace with the plot in a final illustration of the tree that is simply beautiful it s a good book for the story an excellent book for the story plus the art what makes it a great book truly a beautiful book is the language which never fails to please to startle to jostle the words are sharp and vivid the rhythm carries you along and the rhymes and slant rhymes sneak up on you in singular moments of sheer joy in language the book is a pure clinic in children s picture books as all three elements plot art and language each alone a superior example come together to create a whole even greater than its impressive parts a great book highly recommended 
peristaltic reflex or peristaltic cognition this has been a challenging book to read but well worth the effort it is a peculiar mix of memoir and introductory textbook on the enteric gut system i found myself woefully unprepared to consume the text gershon has tried to write for the lay reader but that lay reader had better be comfortable with organic chemistry despite the jargon gershon s enthusiasm is infectious this would be a great gift for any pre med student in need of inspiration the title is somewhat misleading the second brain is a catchy phrase but only token effort is made to prove the assertion in simple terms gershon argues at the cellular level enteric neurology uses the same building blocks as spinal neurology so there is no evidence enteric neurology couldn t be a second brain the fundamental process managed by enteric neurology is the peristaltic reflex the peristaltic reflex requires sophisticated neurological controls for managinga motion of food through the gutb control of ph viscosity appropriate digestive enzyme etc since the gut can function adequately despite cutting the neural connection between spine brain and gut the neural mass in the gut must constitute an independent cognitive center brainthe first pages address gershon s efforts to prove enteric neurology uses the same neurotransmitters as the spinal chord the second pages offers a tour of the gut starting at the mouth and walking down the lining to the colon the final section provides a blow byblow description of his lab s trial anderror experimental approach to enteric developmental neurology with emphasis on microbiological techniques for examining the neural crest s role there is little or no text defining the systemic nature of a brain and then asking if the enteric neural system qualifies for the title nd brain in short gershon avoids the quagmire of differentiating peristaltic reflex from peristaltic cognition since one cannot address this question without assimilating most of the material gershon presents perhaps without the historonics and the book is so much fun as it is who am i to complain important subtopics the academic battles gershon fought to make enteric neurology an accepted academic field of study how th century european poisons help illuminate enteric neurology how cholera is perfectly designed to fool enteric defenses including enteric neural signals a detailed review of developmental issues producing aganglionic megacolon hirschsprungs disease scattered about are surprising literary references the bowel s lining is very much like the fields of agincourt after henry v finished dealing with the french army a turf littered with the rotting remains of dead soldiers the soldiers in the bowel of course are fallen enteric nerve cells functional bowel disease is what winston churchill called the soviet union in a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma gershon concludes with a wonderful and very personal answer to his recently deceased father s often asked question what practical benefits does your research offer 
awesome book i read pretty much everything i can find that is written about heaven and what eternal life will be like randy alcorn did a great job of telling what the bible has to say on the subject and then he shares his own ideas and thoughts as well very factual and very inspiring we may not know everything there is to know about life after death but this book will get you thinking it also is excellent in refuting some of the old time traditional misconceptions about heaven i highly recommend it 
from the author of my truths accepting higher knowledge a countinual source of inspiration so i appreciate the book for that fact while there was much useful information provided within this book there were several life situations discussed that i had little interest in 
a compelling story of enviro issues politics and nature a compelling story of how the wolves finally came back to yellowstone a natural history story about these fascinating animals a political story about misinformation disimformation political infighting even major splits in the environmental community the book reads like a novel i highly recommend it 
this is the book to understand spain the first form of this book was simply called the spaniards and was published in a completely revised version came out in with the title changed to the new spaniards this second edition is significantly different that the first new and completely revised edition this must sound convoluted but the evolution of this book reflects the incredible changes that have taken place in spain since the death of dictator franco in indeed some have argued that no other country has changed as much or as rapidly as spain during the past years british journalist john hooper is intimately familiar with spain the well researched well written book is as fine a survey of spanish history life culture and attitudes as you are likely to find his treatment is impartial and fair though his love and respect for spain cannot be obscured it is everything you wanted to know and probably much you did not want to know by that i mean that the strength of the book is also its weakness for some people though i am somewhat familiar with spain i learned a great deal and was fascinated with the breath depth and accuracy of information hooper provides i also found myself slugging it out though seemingly endless statistics economic studies and obscure names acronyms and personalities despite that hooper strikes a fine balance between academic excellence and readability even though you may be overwhelmed by more information than you can absorb hooper usually keeps your interest and gets the main point across if you are planning a vacation in spain the new spaniards may be more information than you care to know even a causal tourist though can benefit greatly from this book by intentionally focusing on what is interesting and relevant and not carrying the self imposed burden of trying to remember or understand every detail of particular value is hooper s firm grasp of the different peoples languages and regions of spain if you are going to spain as an exchange student or otherwise planning to spend an extended period of time in spain this is the place to begin your education 
a lovely book the mayor of macdougal street is a lovely book full of wit and full of heart it is probably partly due to my having lived and worked during the folk and blues revival of the sixties and seventies and having known some of the people in cambridge and the village that van ronk writes so tenderly about that i enjoyed the book as much as i did the reader who is unacquainted with that scene and that time might find it less compelling my fondness for this great musician and voluptuary has been heightened by this memoir and its companion cd of the same title 
amazing elevated poetry the quality of this work is exceptional i d be surprised if you could find language this ele vated anywhere else except for the book of isaiah in the original language

well reserched i would recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn about ho this book was not biased as many other books written by american war veterans this author was unbiased which i belive is important in writing a biography the only thing i disagreed with the author on is at the end he equates capitalisum with progress which is not always true some of the poorist countries on earth have been capitalist for generations this books demonstrates why ho is one of the great revolutionaries of the th century along with che gruvara and nelson mandella like these great men ho s family life suffered bc he was so deticated to his cause he traveled around the world like these men and his country became a great military power shatering the inviciblity of the so called honest heroic american fighting man many american gi s still are unable to come to terms with this fact this book also shows how truely moderate ho was unlike those leaders who came after him if he was still alive the war with communist china may not have taken place and he cared for the people who had nothing and always lead a modest meager life unlike these so called great american presidents like bush and the bush clone john kerr 
patterson returns to form mary mary is a step in the right direction for james patterson s alex cross novels following the abysmal london bridges i m not a hard core fan of james patterson who i find inconsistent and in particular i m not a big fan of alex cross who i find dull i was pleased that the diversions into alex s personal life were kept to a relative minimum in mary mary and mostly kept to the first half of the novel i know a lot of readers think of alex as an old friend and they want to check in on his personal life and catch up with how he s doing but i find these chapters to be nothing short of torture to read despite getting bogged down in the early chapters with alex s personal life mary mary turns into a good taut thriller i found the storyteller to be an entertaining sociopath to spend time with a good killer is essential to novels like this patterson doesn t provide much insight into the storytellers mind and motivation but i enjoyed his ranting all the same the plot is filled with twists and turns some predictable some less so readers of james patterson who were dismayed by recent alex cross novels four blind mice big bad wolf and london bridges will be pleased to note that patterson has returned to form with mary mary patterson may be lazy with his research and have a poor ear for dialogue but he can churn out a good thriller from time to time this is his best in a while 
fun informative i liked the salary portions and the job descriptions best was fun to see how much others make good for finding comparisons in various areas ie stress levels money and perks too 
heartache i thought that this book was very good it described the loneliness and confusion of not knowing and understanding oneself and one s origin it is about love and forgivness patience and acceptance and loving oneself fully i liked how the book focused on many diverse issues such as socioeconomic class gender roles separation and divorce and the life cycle of a marriage and a family i did not like the ending as much i thought that the ending could have been more descriptive of the chracters lives but instead it seemed to have stopped abruptly 
a great account after seeing how many reviews angelas ashes have i was hesitating if i should add my own at the end i decided to do so without reading the other reviews maybe i will repeat things already said but i wanted to express my opinion because this book deserves all the good words it gets memoir is an increasingly popular type of prose essentially everyone feels they can write a memoir and this is true of course the difficult thing which not just anyone can achieve is writing a good memoir which would stand out of the crowd frank mccourt succeeded in this respect angelas ashes describe the the author s memories from his earliest years until he is nineteen his family is central to the book which starts when his parents angela and malachy meet they live in brooklyn where frank his brother malachy the twins and the sister are born then it follows the family through the deaths of several children the return to ireland the fight with objective difficulties as well as the personal faults frank s illnesses observations the life of the street children and poor people in limerick frank s school years during the world war ii until his travel back to america the family is in a way a typical irish family with a curse of alcoholism hanging over it with the history of ireland present at every moment with the respect for irish tradition and catholic church with poverty and daily struggle but despite the accurate descriptions of the shortcomings of his parents and a great dose of bitterness and criticism mccourt manages to show his affection towards them and leave the reader without doubt as to his love for both of them the insights into the society system and life of the community are very accurate and sharp as well the book written from a position of the child growing up which is reflected in the language and imagery evokes powerful emotions so strong that it brigs tears to the eyes and leaves the reader in wonder there is however a fair share of humor especially later in the book so everything is well balanced yet natural the pullitzer prize was in this case deserved i heartily recommend angelas ashes and will definitely read and review tis 
biblical amnesia a forgotten story of redemption scott gustafson in clear and easy to read language speaks about some startling ideas that are found in scripture but which have been forgotten due to our cultural relgion covering up the message of the bible the fact that morality comes as a result of the human fall into sin and is a force for death rather than life was a new way for me of seeing the context of the biblical writings he makes use of the work of raine eisler to define dominator and partnership ways and shows how the scriptures both old and new testament are examples of a partnership model trying to survive in a dominator system this book would be helpful to anyone who is working on models of change both in the church as well as any political organization anyone in a position of power in an organization would find it useful in defining a role that has as it purpose the fostering of partnerships rather than autoritarian relationships 
a first rate little book ought to be must reading not only for car guys but aircraft maintenance students homebuilders and for electronics hobbyists as well even if you aren t going to become as skilled as mr fournier it helps to know what can and can t be done and what is involved so you can intelligently talk to fabricators 
incredibly rich family tale you don t have to be catholic i am not for this book to blow you away it is full of truth the characters are real and rich and the story is beautifully written i finished it in tears and cannot recommend it highly enough 
california impressionism wonderful colors and plates inspirational to browse through or informative to read and digest a good addition to any art library 
wonderful study of the plurality of slaveholders james oakes the ruling class is a history of american slaveholders that effectively dispels the image of the paternalistic plantation aristocrat as the definitive or even typical portrait of the average slaveholder it was interesting to see how much the southeners and the northeners had in common in political and ecomonic outlook the average slaveholder was a grasping capitilist continually on the move and trying to advance himself slaves were a commodity to be used in this regard as were the slaveholders democratic politics and the expansion south and westward in the united states the paternalist image built up in mythology after the civil war existed but it was not representative this book is effective is demonstrating the ways in which the slaves were an active often rebellious factor in this capititist drama as they also rejected any paternalist notion of their enslavement and saw the truth of the picture they were a commodity both for labour and commerce the book is excellant in portraying a complicated picture of the slaveholding class that involved many people of different ethnic religious political and economic backgrounds all bound up in a capitilist explotiation of the slaves as a source of upward mobility in a very fluid society a good place to begin to learn about this period of history 
really resonates it s sad to me that bernard malamud s novels seem to be falling by the wayside lately after reading the assistant recently i ve been reminded of just how excellent malamud s writing is in particular malamud is excellent in the assistant his best novel this is definitely one of the must read novels of the twentieth century the novel centers around the characters affected by morris bober s grocery in a poor neighborhood in brooklyn the middle aged morris has lost his life working in the unsuccessful store because of the economic spiritual struggles caused by the store each member of the family has been scarred morris s wife ida has become bitter and cynical his daughter helen searches longingly for love and laments the failed realization of her dreams then into their lives comes frank alpine a troubled depressed man who will become the assistant at the store the four struggle with one another attempting constantly to overcome their harsh fate and to obtain some sort of fulfillment together its a fairly simple story that reads really well and remarkably quickly in my opinion despite the simplicity of the story however meaning almost archetypal meaning ebbs at every moment it s a beautifully conceived and constructed work touching on themes of morality justice redemption and love it s very much about what it means to be human the assistant is definitely one of those novels that serious readers should catch 
a terrifying and unique supernatural story this novel has a wonderfully unique premise the themes of the darker aspects of greek myth sinister woods and what lurks within them unreality right beneath our world make for a delightfull story while the plot is a bit mundane towards the center of the book overall this is compensated for if you ve ever let your mind wander into the origins of ancient myths and have been a bit shocked by what you imagine this is the book for you the sexual aspect of the supernatural events is key and overall adds to the one s attraction and repulsion to the concepts beneath the surface of this book machen was akcknowledged by hp lovecraft as a major influence and one sees this here also spare s illustrations while not done for the book are quite appropriate to convey its themes highly reccomended 
nice and useful this is a very useful text and reference book for electrical engineers and others who are interested its definitely meant for the graduate students and trained engineers and not for the beginners i used this book as a graduate text and am immensely benefitted as i often require to revise many issues regarding my research provides many useful comparisons and references

worth a look this book is definitely full of stereotypes and sweeping generalizations however that does not negate the value of this study there is a lot of useful information about controlling and understanding crowd behavior here 
history is a string full of knots in her debut novel first published in jeanette winterson managed to achieve two important goals one to impress the reader with her autobiographical story and two to create her own style and voice which she developed in her later works at the level of the narrative the reader is completely taken in by the life of an orphan girl raised in england of the s by the strictly religious mother to be a preacher and a missionary the world outside the church community which despite the presence of pastors has a strong matriarchal feeling and the men seems somehow obscure and dispensable is for little jeanette absolutely incomprehensible as a child she does not have a reason not to believe her mother but growing up as an intelligent child with inquisitive mind she begins to ask questions first quietly only in her mind then more openly when she encounters other reality at school and in her town and finally confronted with her own sexuality which is unacceptable by although as it appears not unknown to her church she decides to step out of her life as she knows it go beyond her very limited experience and start afresh very brave i could not help thinking though that her being lesbian seemed to be an obstacle but in a way was helpful because it was the real push to struggle for her own identity for a girl who would marry it would be probably less difficult to settle down quietly and stop asking questions like it was for melanie jeanette s first love in the novel the oranges from the title become the symbol of the forced limitations the book is full of general thoughts and although there is no great philosophy the discoveries of adolescence are put into great words winterson s voice sometimes sound incredibly bitter and she paints the characters with certain cruelty although the book if full of funny anecdotes it is a sad kind of humor i hope this was a catharsis to write it the author admits that we create our own history and memories are what we remember and shape ourselves therefore far from objective report of the past formally the novel is divided into chapters bearing the titles of the initial books of the old testament there are also many religious metaphors and similes throughout winterson uses simple short sentences which gives the book the clarity interchanging with the main plot are short tales which remind me of things i imagined and put on paper when i was a child they are a great insight into the mind fears and fantasies of a sensitive girl and look very real although are obviously conceived at the same time as the whole novel although it would be nice to think that winterson incorporated her real childhood creations as they run in parallel with the plot and are inseparable from it i think that for anyone who wants to become familiar with winterson s prose this is the best place to start

recommend to couples going to be married this book was for my daughter and her fiancee who are going to be married this sept it was recommended by the pastor who taught their week premarital class at their church mars hill in seattle i have heard this was a good book before this time anyway it is concise well written easy to read and i highly recommend it to young and old couples my daughter is pretty innocent and this book makes it clear but not unappealing has parts on birth control as well if you want a book that both presents sex well and from the christian perspective within marriage this is the book for you i also liked it that it did not have pictures which i think make a book a little less appealing and prurient 
a relatively quick read with lots of good information for obvious reasons the witness protection program has always been and probably always will be controversial i believe the authors make a very good case for its merits however thanks to this program the law now has much more effective tools to protect ordinary people from the reckless greed crazed megalomaniacs who prey on them it also gives those trapped in this soul deadening lifestyle an opportunity to change their lives and make something worthwhile out of them apparently thousands of families lives have been changed for the better as a result politicians and television journalists like geraldo rivera thrive on stories like that of protected witness marion pruett who murdered his own wife and four other people after having entered witsec often though certain inconvenient details get swept aside such as the fact that pruett would have been released from jail by the time he committed his crimes anyway whether he had joined the witness protection program or not because his sentence would have run out by then none of us like to see dangerous people on the loose but the simple fact is that you can t keep everyone who has ever committed a crime in jail even if there weren t any ethical issues involved there simply aren t enough resources thanks to our unrealistic drug laws the united states is already the largest per capita holder of prisoners in the entire world what a sad commentary on the so called land of the free and home of the brave i recommend this book for the fascinating glimpses it provides of politics both inside and outside the justice department i was irritated to read about how j edgar hoover s solution to organized crime was to simply claim it didn t exist despite the overwhelming evidence that it did and i was enraged to read about jeb bush s lobbying to get a dangerous anti castro terrorist an early release from jail in order to drum up votes in miami s cuban community for his father s re election but i was also gratified to learn how hard work by gerald shur howard safir and hundreds of others has paid off over the years despite attempts by corrupt government officials in america and elsewhere to both exploit and defeat it also interesting was the story of how shur and several deputy marshals traveled to nicaragua during the reagan years to protect the judge and jury of a trial against five soldiers accused of raping and murdering a carload of american nuns the descriptions of the dangerous and seemingly hopeless conditions judges worked under in that country at that time made me thankful to be a citizen of a country which while it is not perfect at least offers its citizens a reasonably safe and reasonably fair environment in which to pursue meaningful lives the description of colombia under the reign of terror of pablo escobar and other psychopaths was also frustrating to read it s only fair to blame those americans and others who supported escobar through the purchase of illegal drugs for enabling him to become so powerful and despotic nevertheless those who persist in believing that the best course of action to take against drugs is to simply ban them must surely see that they do just as much to enable the escobars of yesterday and today than drug users for certainly the price of these drugs is kept artificially very high because of the risks that must be taken to produce and distribute them like all problems the problem of illegal drugs is not a simple black and white issue that can be solved by simply resorting to punitive measures what is needed is innovative thinking such as what has gone toward the establishment and refinement of the witness protection program over the past four decades 
the conservative s bible kirk s book is supposedly the bible of conservatives not neo conservatives but conservatives he sets up the long standing debate between the french and voltaie and the english using burke as it s spokesman supposedly kirk would limit the vote have a professional class of government officials reduce if not eliminate most taxes and let each individual strive for success this is the basic mantra of classical conservatives and is all well and good as far as it goes but only a few of the many ever succeed this way one of the surprises is how young kirk was when this book was written it s as if he had some inspiration for on high probably not or was cherry picking history probably closer to the truth after reading this book i had a better understanding of where the conservatives are coming from althohgh i still don t understand why an obscure royalist politician from the th century should be their flag bearer royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the us although we seem to flirt with it from time to time conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy as we currently have in the us they would rather rely on accidents of birth cronyism and college organizations to select administrators rather than people who have succeeded in other venues a very informative albeit frightening book 
superb biography of a dominant th century industrialist and philanthropist the best biography of a th century industrialist i have read since the titan by chernow almost years ago a multi dimensional view into his business raltionships with his right hand man frick and also his personality problems with his men and also john d rockefeller krass brings to light carnegie s love and dislikes and explores his undying love for his birthplace in scotland this biography gives you excellent balance so you will not ask any more questions once you complete it carnegie although the leading philathropist of the th and early th century was a demon of a businessman you only cared about his name and not the thousands of factory workers he indirectly killed with overwork and underpay next time if i go to carnegie hall i will now look at it in a much poorer light knowing the monies to build it came from the blood of thousands 
big on ideas i found this book to be great ! it gave me alot to consider that i had not even thought about it you are planning to build a home this is a great book it starts out giving you advice on what to look for in your floor plan then walks you thru the complete building process i was hoping for a little more advice on how to go about being your own contractor but the book did not promis that this book will be by my side for a while

a funfilled journey through rome this was in my opinion one of the best marcus didius adventures marcus s relationship with his father adds great humor to an already wonderful story 
great book first i would like to state the reason i gave it stars in my opinion stars should be very hard to reach maybe i would give this stars if it was possible anyway i m a self taught vb programmer with a working knowledge of the windows api first year cs student though i ve read many a book on c and a few on assembly i have a large cs library and this is the first book of it s kind that i ve found it is a little pricey if you compare book size to other larger cs books but i don t think it is overpriced the material is great though i wouldn t say it is a beginner level book i had trouble grasping enough of the material that it causes me to think either i ve still got a long ways to go in learning more so than i thought at least or it is just not for the beginner i would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about a programming career regardless of the language the book s relatively small size should not be a negative factor it is not densely packed with information to the point where interpretation is needed instead it explains in sufficient detail without dumbing it down by over repetition and such used by some other cs books it is aimed at c c programmers so being familiar with those is a prerequisite obviously like another reviewer said there seemed to be a little too much discussion on say serialization of linked data structures an important topic with regards to memory yet i felt a little more emphasis could have been placed elsewhere 
a delight to read what a beautifully written perfectly executed book ! i loved how messud intertwined each generation s family history into the present history of the teen girl narrator sagesse the sins of the father will visit upon the son indeed or in this case the granddaughter messud s command of language is impressive and her prose is so lyrical and magical perhaps a bit too lyrical for a year old algerian girl but that is a minor point the book itself is perfectly paced and exquisite i highly recommend it 
some good stories a few misses russert has distilled a large number of readers letters into a very readable book there are a number of truly inspiring stories in this collection there are however a few that were disappointing i also found a few admittedly minor items rather annoying the commentary by russert at the start of each story doesn t really add much and the chapter on baseball should have been named the yankees as russert manages to ignore just about every other team in the sport in favor of the pinstripes still it s enjoyable to read some of the many ways that fathers influence their children s lives 
an excellent book all the way mr katz is an amazing author wonderfully well written a hilarious look at the life and actions of a dog with issues proof that with an informed caring owner can help a canine with issues become a wonderful companion i read this book last fall then proceeded to purchase a copy for every dog lover on my christmas list i have since purchased every book written by jon katz i look forward to more books by this author 
ethics without foundations williams s main projects in ethics and the limits of philosophy are to argue against the idea that there is a rational foundation for ethics to argue that there is no adequate ethical theory nor is there likely ever to be such a theory and to broaden the focus of moral philosophy from a focus on the role of obligation in life to a wider array of considerations that are relevant in deciding how one should live the book has excellent discussions of and arguments against aristotle s attempt to find a foundatoin for ethics in human nature that is in the idea that there is something about the function of a human life that makes an ethical life proper and kant s attempt to find a foundation for ethics in a bare committment to rationality williams is convincing in arguing that in order for the claims of an ethical life to get a grip on an individual that individual must have some committment to ethics already it is possible for someone to be rational and unethical that does not imply williams points out there are not reasons to be ethical many people have good reasons to be ethical it s just that we we would be wrong to criticize those unethical people as necessarily being irrational williamss discussions of truth in ethics and of relativism are less convincing but equally valuable williams argues that evaluative statements that use thick terms terms like loyal murder cruel that are evaluative like the terms good and right but can be applied with descriptive accuracy in a way that those more general terms cannot be applied can be true but reflection on thick terms unseats them and they are replaced by nothing knew for example in the modern western world the thick term chaste has become obsolete while it was once a term that could be used to make true and false moral statements reflection upon sexuality has for argument s sake undermined our use of the term because of the role reflection plays people are unlikely to ever converge on ethical truths that correspond to reality the way that scientific factual beliefs do related to this is williams s moderate ethical relativism there are some terms used in distant in space or time societies that we recognize as evaluative but that we cannot judge by the lights of our own set of evaluative concepts i don t find williams s views here convincing becuase i don t believe in his underlying cartesian theory of truth and i don t buy his relativism because i think it s impossible not to evalute the way that other people or other cultures even those of the distant past evaluate one can t be neutral on how other people think and act the book also has strong lively and sophisticated critiques of consequentalism and contractarianisn williams believes that neither is an adequate ethical theory because each theory is based on unrealistic views of what it means to be a real person in the world with real desires for example contract based views of ethics assume that people can shed their actual beliefs and desires and still deliberate about how to act but if one distances himself from his own desires and beliefs based on what does this more abstract self deliberate the book is leas interersting when williams obsesses over the distortion that the exclusive emphasis on obligation in moral philosophy has wrought on moral thinking i think this was a big deal at the time the book was written but for a non philosopher reading it now these concerns largely confined to the last chapter were a bit boring finally i would recommend reading williams s essay internal and external reasons in his collection moral luck to better understand his views on the relation between rationality and morality 
nd edition is a classic for applied nonparametrics i own the second edition so my comments refer mainly to it conover writes very well and covers all the commonly used nonparametric tests he does a great job of handling the special treatment when there are many ties in a rank test he also provides many important statistical tables my understanding of the third edition is that it continues to cover the nonparametric procedures that have stood the test of time and that popular modern methods like bootstrap are also covered 
oates at her best joyce carol oates is a marvelous writer who does very well exploring the dark seamy underside of life and in faithless she remains faithful to her style the characters in these stories have all been betrayed in one way or the other and deal with their betrayal in different and sometimes really warped ways these stories are all strong all engrossing and will please those just discovering oates and those who have admired her all along 
very interesting book i m currently reading gulliver s travels for my english class and i have to say what a very interesting book i wasn t a huge fan of classic books but this book so far has surprised me i like how the author wrote the book to where you just can t put the book down sadly though some parts can be quite boring but the author is able to change that and make it interesting again so if anyone is reading my review so get a copy of this book immediately or else you will be missing out on something very interesting

a must for all puppy owners first of all i have to respond to an earlier reviewer who says that shirlee kalstone doesn t know anything about dogs and suggests that people should instead read a book by someone who does namely stanley coren i m still laughing over that stanley coren it s widely known in dog circles that coren gets almost everything about dogs exactly backwards read my review of the intelligence of dogs for further elucidation it seems to me from reading this person s review that she somehow misunderstood the simple information in kalstone s book and instead of admitting her own inability to follow instructions she blames the author okay now to my review of this very useful housebreaking guide one that i recommend to all my clients with new puppies i have to say that except for kalstone s occasional forays into punishment via the alpha theory which we now know is totally false this book gives you almost everything you need to know about housetraining the fact that she s broken down the various schedules any dog owner might need allowing for various work schedules and life styles makes this book a must have for every owner of a new puppy its why i recommend it to all my clients it saves them and me the time of sitting down and writing up a schedule of their own she also gives good advice on how to acquaint any puppy with a crate and gives the info that most other books don t that a puppy s emotional and physical development prevent him or her from really learning this stuff before about to months of age just please please ignore everything she says about being the pack leader being alpha etc and you and your puppy will do just fine by the way most of the information in this book and a little more is also contained in kevin behan s natural dog training with just one omission kevin doesn t include the actual training schedules that you can rip out of the kalstone book and paste on to your refrigerator door i rarely give any training book stars yay shirlee kalstone

publisher s grotesque academic irresponsibility cutting footnotes this great biography was written by an academic historian who gathers and compares several sources yet the publisher to cut costs cuts the footnotes which are of essential and greatest interest in our era of intellectual property and knowledge as commodity the publisher did not wish to provide the reader with specific indications for further study through the footnotes with the collapse of the internet we may never know what amplifications and insights the author may have included in these footnotes which were no doubt as exhaustive as the work itself how could the once great st martin s have been so academically irresponsible for commercial purposes it is as inexplicable as our once great nation s journey from the intelligent jfk to the solipsistic w

delightful range of essays on current topics this is a great collection of issues and debates in science that those of us out of the field or even involved in other research fields will find interesting they re as clearly written as editor oliver sacks works and each has at least one topical issue to catch the reader s interest some have several each story has something fascinating about it the forest primeval tells about an area of the congo which humans hadn t penetrated and the impact of the wildlife on the ecology there are some surprising elements to it including that it might once have been populated by humans mann s article from atlantic monthly goes through what the new world might have been like prior to columbus and highlights a debate between new historians and traditionalists over whether the continent was empty or whether old world diseases killed up to of the population before colonists began arriving the learning curve deals with the practical skills of learning to be a doctor don t let me in the hospital any time soon notes from a parallel universe deals with the people who try to convince scientists of bizarre theories at berkeley they even keep the crackpots papers learn about seattle s yuckies in shadow creatures gunjan sinha s article on voles indicates that what you might be experiencing isn t love but a hormone called oxytocin the article from new republic titled fighting chance is a great story of research and how a scientist s career decision got made why turn red unravels part of a mystery for why leaves turn red an energy consuming activity that often occurs when the leaves are at the end of the photosynthetic life if you want a great theme for a scary kids story for a fiction class the stuff in got silk has the raw material for good science fiction the essay on hawking is interesting if only because the bet that it refers to from was just settled about a month ago with hawking admitting that he was wrong cassuto s essay from salon portrays the impact of a scandal on the science world where the collateral damage can be as broad as in the financial world and finally the last essay does justice to the career of stephen jay gould as a biologist essayist and ardent enemy of creationist influence on public policy plus you can even learn which tv show retired lab chimpanzees prefer im a sucker for the best american short stories collections issued each year but this collection of science essays exceeded my expectations so much so that i sent it to my daughter at college 
a return to form my book club read the full cupboard of life for our meeting last month and as i have long been a fan of this series i felt the need to read the next book in the series ! i like to wait for the softcover version so i was thrilled to get it for the nicer softcover price after the last book which i enjoyed greatly but found to sometimes stretch the boundaries of believability i felt that mccall smith returned to his usual good form in this book the introduction of two major new characters a new employee for the garage detective agency and a new beau for the somewhat challenging mma makutsi or as everyone else seems to call her mma breathes fresh life into the series both are very lovely and likable characters who are perfect extensions to the family that mma ramotswe likes to surround herself with the detective stories seem to be taking an increasing back seat which isn t really a problem as they ve never been the focus of the series anyway the mysteries to be solved are usually resolved by someone simply flapping their gums and telling a secret though strangely the mystery that opens the book is never solved perhaps it will be revisited in the sequel one thing that i really enjoyed was the author s increasing exploration of the occasionally moderately contentious relationship between mma ramotswe mma makutsi as makutsi has come into her own more and more she has begun to chafe a bit under mma ramotswe s direction and the two occasionally get on each other s nerves this is a lovely breath of realism in a series noted for its idealism all in all recommended though newbies should probably start with the earier books in the series also recommended thus was adonis murdered by sarah caudwell who gets the apartment by steven rigolosi 
a material really easy to read and understand good use of plain english it was even read by my boyfriend who is a bass player and he learned a thing or two from it aswell so its targeted at all level

could see this one on the big screen very well written fast moving intelligent dialogue among the main characters very likable heroine at times though i could have wrung her neck for not seeing what she had in joe fast enough but that s just me a totally fallinlove instantly type of hero if this were made into a movie i could easily see simon baker as joe he has dreamy eyes and a drop dead gorgeous smile just like joe good book fast read i only gave it stars though because i would have liked to have read more on their happily ever after didn t want it to end

a really good read anthropologist dr bill brockton is summoned to a tennessee mountain town where the local sheriff and deputy take him to see a mummified corpse of a young woman his first task is to find out who she is and how she died and then he has to find out who killed her while not dying himself i liked this book the protagonist clearly knows his forensics but is down to earth gets car sick is emotionally insecure and very human the story opens with a great hook and kept me going straight through to the end the sense of place dialogue and suspense and references to other authors characters and books all contributed to my enjoyment of the story the supporting characters are diverse from the small town sheriff to the vietnam vet to brockton s assistant but they all have definite personalities some of the forensic detail may not be for the faint of stomach but it is fascinating stuff this was one really good read 
searching for ignatius as she kicks off the ninth book in this series lilian jackson braun reintroduces her readers to the resort town of mooseville this is where jim qwilleran was staying when he inherited millions or billions of dollars he isn t sure which it is yet of course we know that wherever qwilleran and his cats koko and yum yum go there is going to be a mystery and although the mystery in this book develops slowly it is always there lurking in the background like the other books in this series the mystery here is light and almost incidental to the story but the depth and richness of the characters and setting more than make up for any lack of intrigue this story really begins when qwilleran and his pals return to the lakeside cabin in mooseville and settle in for the summer almost immediately he has to call out a plumber and from there qwilleran s trials continue and include leaky pipes a mouse hole a tornado and finally a body buried beneath the cabin to make matters worse qwilleran decides to enlarge the cabin but finds that all of the licensed carpenters are busy working on local developments until the end of the season so he ends up hiring unlicensed carpenters who keep disappearing unlike some of the previous books in this series the clues as to what is going on and who is involved are clear and easily identifiable in this book in some of the other books there have been no clues at all until the end but i figured this one out long before the book was over i was mistaken about the motive however and would never have put two and two together if koko had not forced qwilleran and me to look at the evidence which was setting in the cabin in a paper bag it is a good thing that koko made his move when he did for qwilleran himself was a suspect in the murder of one ignatius k small a carpenter who could go to sleep while nailing shingles on a roof for fans of this series qwilleran s trip back to mooseville will be a welcome change of pace and will allow long time fans to get reacquainted with the people and places of this resort town braun s rich writing style and her colorful characters are the core elements of the entire series and this book is no exception no this is not a hard core mystery but it is a fun and very enjoyable read 
very good information back to basics with lots of good information gives you a new look at how to eat correctly stay full and keep healthy 
excellent history having read many if not too many according to some us civil war books and specifically books on gettysburg i am by no means an expert but i do think i do know a good book on the subject matter and this is a good book in fact i d recommend it as one of the books to read on this battle and yes i m including coddington s study here s why in a military history it s very easy to get bogged down in mind numbing detail on weapons personnel maneuvers strategy jargon doesn t happen in this book secondly this author does a very good job at setting the scene for the battle again without overwhelming the reader with historical detail lastly and i think this point will be appreciated by novice and expert alike the author deals with all the controversies j eb stuart s absence pickett s charge the choice of gettysburg as the battlefield and especially what was going on between lee and longstreet as well as much more in a rational and factual manner this is a well written engaging book that i would have no problem recommending to either a civil war novice or buff not something i normally do but similar as to how mcpherson s battle cry of freedom captures the whole war this book does the much same for the battle of gettysburg 
one of my favorites i ve been going through reviews trying to find a specific book i lost years ago and found that this one hasn t been reviewed by anyone yet this is probably my favorite harlequin book i ve enjoyed most of ms ross s books but this one is absolutely the best filled with all the desire deception heartbreak and hope that one could want in a romance rich famous gorgeous and reclusive pearce tyron seeks to hire a nany for a baby girl in his custody hoping to get a good story reporter cathy fielding inadvertantly gets the job set up with lies from the first time they meet eachother the story of pearce and cathy has me choked up each time i read it 
delighted with this book it s funny how some books end up getting used more than others i m not sure i would have predicted i d have used this so much but i ve ended up making more cookies from this one little book than any other on my shelf and there are many i m an ambitious baker but when it comes to those night before moments when i need to bake a batch of cookies for somewhere or someone i m more often than not a bit too tired this is simply a very handy book and i ve had lots of success with the recipes although looking back almost of my choices have been citrus type cookies i think the addition of bright flavors is what makes the dough taste like homemade the lemon poppyseed tart is also quite good very pretty and people were impressed i put fresh blackberries on top gorgeousthanks for a lovely useful book 
informative entertaining but not scholarly i like to think of this book in terms of what a typical educated person in india hindu or non hindu and not a scholar of religions would know about the hindu religion from being immersed in hindu culture just as an american or european would absorb an understanding of the concepts of christianity similarly for a person brought up in muslim buddhist or other cultural surroundings this book succeeds i think in conveying a working knowledge of hinduism to a person who was brought up in another culture reading the book would enrich a visit to india or a relationship with a hindu friend the book also is entertaining and well organized as other reviewers have commented making a topic that can be forbidding in its vastness complexity and differing threads easy to digest however the author has neither a historian s drive for perspective nor a journalist s detachment she frequently shifts in and out of character between believer and skeptic sometimes on the same page see for example the page containing the explanation of the word rishi the book contains many stories of dubious historical validity based only on anecdotal evidence there is much credence for the paranormal in the hindu world too at least as represented in this book and so your skeptical reviewer got a headache i wanted either to explore the background of the stories or else to lay aside the topic because i could spend the rest of my life in such research and there are other ways i would rather spend my time this same conundrum would be found of course in encountering hinduism out in the world rather than in a book so maybe there s a lesson in the presentation ! certainly read this book to understand the concepts vocabulary and practices of hinduism but you may save yourself a headache if you can avoid chasing after the loose ends 
sets the players in their time wood sets the stage for his biovignettes of selected revolutionaries by describing their world each was influenced positively or negatively by the aristocracy of the old world the best essay on character as i took the title is that of washington probably because he had so much of it gw not only rejects the opportunity to be like a monarch he actually frees his slaves and provides for those too feeble to benefit from freedom washington worries about the propriety of this and that and is careful about setting precedents all americans are indebted to him for setting high standards on day one he seems the least influenced by the workless mandate of the gentleman unlike some of the others he actually fought in the war of them all the high born burr comes off the worst he s the first to milk patronage and court lobbyists the portrait of jefferson is the weakest while actions and words on slavery are given a reasonable treatment sally hemmings is dismissed in a paragraph here also the author allows his modern stereotypes to intervene he compares jefferson to a knee jerk liberal because wood says tj is not an original thinker but doesn t relate this to jefferson s contempt for big government and says like modern day liberals tj can t understand economic forces is our spend thrift congress liberal wood s stereotypes later surface in the paine essay where he implies modern day liberals see society as malevolent and government as beneficent wood is able to bring us into that world where so much was still to be known the founders ideas were confined to what they knew hamilton had a vision and worked hard to sell the idea of currency others navigated the new political landscape to sell the idea of federalism to self interested provincial state governments the founders dispair as their letters to one another diminish in importance as coarser tracts of the common man bereft of classical illusions become more influential most of these revolutionaries died discouraged or worried about the changes they had wrought wood has digested a lot of information i gave the book stars and not because i took the title to mean there would be more on morals ethics and hoped to learn more about attitudes towards slavery the native population business dealings and women family the introductory chapter implies that the book will do this but in this book character is more like disposition and through it we learn the attitudes of these revolutionaries and how these attitudes related to constitutional and governance issues 
very important good read dr anatoly fomenko is at the forefront of the new chronology but this work is still original style tone very informative detailed quotes dr fomenko lightly even though it s part of the new chronology club history as most know understand is a sham scam as far as i m concerned there has always been contoversial information that is sidestepped swept under the rug it s about time researchers come out challenge academia as well as religious institution s established history chronology too much financial profiteering as well as life death decisions were made with foolish ignorant propagandic logic for society to go forward evolve it s important to understands it s history correctly even if these new chronology books are partially true the implications are profound so educators civil authorities students of history need to read these books

commendable i do not like jeffrey deaver s work however a family friend of mine surprised me by sending me in which i promised to read without looking at the cover or looking at the top of the pages to see who had written it though hard to do i managed to read two stories without checking who the author was when i saw it was deaver i was shocked these stories are absolutely wonderful though they are mainly mystery suspense there s a sort of twilight zone feel to them i would highly reccomend this to anyone regardless of what genres they read 
review of harriet tubman s underground railroad in the sky the story of the underground railroad is presented in a magical yet understandable way for primary school children cassie and her brother begin a journey to freedom just like generations before them did in order to escape slavery cassie and her brother learn about slavery and the reasons why so many braved the perilous journey to the northern states and canada cassie relives the journey and experiences many of the feelings and events that others did as she desperately tries to catch up to her brother who has boarded the quottrainquot the illustrations of acrylic on canvas enhance and heighten the excitement as cassie makes her way through the woods and meets with those willing to help her i recommend this book to others as a great way to explain the concept of the underground railroad and it s place in our country s history 
a good novel as well as a lovely piece of writing i enjoy el doctorow s work so it was with pleasurable anticipation that i picked up city of god and was astonished at what a beautiful book he had wrought you should when approaching this book be aware that the narrative is experimental and postmodern it certainly fits every definition of postmodernism that i ve ever read including that in my favorite reference teaching the postmodern yes it begins with a riff on physics and awe it includes epistolary sections from characters to a character based on el doctorow there is also a strong narrative thread that keeps the book from becoming amorphous literary rap lyrics an enormous bronze cross has been stolen as is revealed on the fourth page and its chase leads tom pemberton to rabbi joshua the hebrew name for jesus and i m shocked that none of the other very intelligent reviewers here seem to have picked that one up esp considering later plot developments and sarah his wife very da vinci code there tom s interactions with joshua form the ahem crux of the novel and change tom s life irrevocably while i too am astonished by the beauty of the book and i appreciate the effect of all the narrative threads and their coalescence after the last page is turned reading the book itself is an enjoyable experience the characters are drawn nicely there is excellent tension and struggle within the characters lives and the plot leads from one suspenseful scene to the next tk kenyonrabid coming in from kunati book

the man that could fly i do not recommend this book to people who like horror or mystery because it is not at all scary and has no mystery in it what so ever i would recommend this book to someone who just wants something to read because this book is easy to read and is a very moving story the story was very anticlimactic nothing was really left for the reader to try and figure out this story was not boring but it could have used some more excitement being a sci fi genre the plot was not supposed to be believable but while reading the story you can get into the characters lives and feel how they feel about their problems depending upon the title of the book i may read another book by david almond 
wisdom from an authentic life sadly very few books and authors today can genuinely be called wise this is not the case with mr michell nor his books this collection in particular enchants delights and educates based upon it s friendly approachable wisdom this is not a wisdom based upon intellectual fireworks or shallow wit but rather a deep seated wisdom of a life lived with a questioning open mind for the wonders and paradox that surround us we know we are in for an amazing tour de force when michell reveals plato and charles fort as his favorite philosophers a times the britishness of some of the topics and characters may be meaningless to most americans that alas is our fault not his this is a traditionalism borne of earth based mythopoeic realities not guenonian traditionalism of right wing fantasy comparisons are often unfair but the only other author that comes to mind with that same sense of authentic life wisdom in their work is p l travers time spent with mr michell is not only time well spent with a magnificent fun loving human being but an opportunity for edification and how often is that possible in this vulgar day age 
online dating story ok this book was difficult for me to rate i loved the book itself its a great read and gives tons of good advice if you re looking to meet someone online however i took the book s advice and ended up meeting someone online so it does work i met this guy on a site called catch com and he seemed really awesome when i chatted with him online and talked with him on the phone but when we met in person he was terrible ! rude loud and obnoxious the date was just aweful now i understand that this was just one experience but it s made me question the idea of meeting people online you can never be sure of what you re going to get so while the book is a wonderful and interesting read make sure you re really ready to meet someone online before you take any of its advice 
an extremely entertaining read julian rubinstein tells the true story of attila ambrus the transylvanian born backup hockey goalie in budapest who also lived the life of a pelt smuggler and daring bank robber between practices and games it was a story the author first heard about in a short news piece in sports illustrated in and on writing the book he s able to set the story in hilarious style against the backdrop of the changing hungary and romania of the early s at one point ambrus is described as a sizable conundrum within a notable contradiction the best unpaid hockey goalie in a filthy rich slum town the photo section in the middle the appendices and interview with the author at the end and the references throughout to world events the west would be familiar with serve to remind us that this is largely a work of non fiction despite all the absurdity a great read especially for those who have visited or have lived in this part of the world in these changing times from socialism

a bound classic freyfogle s volume is a little known classic a wide ranging thoughtful even lyrical inquiry into the ways we see the land and understand our place in it the book is hard to categorize for it transcends all academic fields and conventional ways of thinking about environmental issues freyfogle s well grounded premise is that our environmental problems are at root cultural ones having to do with our over reliance on liberal individualism in all its forms step by step he encourages us to rethink our cultural presumptions and urges us in a gentle reflective way to imagine landscapes that healthier for nature and people at the center of his own vision is the idea of quotland health quot which he proposes as an alternative to sustainable development and its alternatives some readers will conclude that he is too ambitious in calling for a reshaping of our dominant culture others that he is too hesitant to assign blame to bad actors rather than to society as a whole but many will agree with the observation of historian don worster that quotamong the many voices trying to articulate an environmental philosophy for our time eric freyfogle is unsurpassed quot

good resource for inclusion it gets the kids talking when i first read this book i was not crazy about it i tend not to like books directed at kids that are overtly about autism because the kids automatically know that it is a lesson book rather than a story book but of all the books i bought in an effort to give the regular education teacher a tool for talking with my son s typical classmates about his autism this is the one that my typical year old daughter selected we have used it for three years and each time the teacher has said it generated an interesting and sensitive dicussion among the children grades of course it takes a good teacher to lead the discussion too but this book has proved to be a valuable resource 
hopefully this book will find many readers please let the fundamentalists of the three monoteistic religions moslims christians and jews read this book yhvh jehova jahwe allah the europaens call it god they are all the same when you see them under the monotheistic impression what we call god today was formed from the characteristics of many other gods to give us a monotheistic point of view a character so schizophrenic as our fundamentalists are who influence politics now why are we fighting about the true religion kill each other in the name of this warlord it reminds us to the prayers before battle the christian priest pastorspreachers etc were all praying before the fight poor lord how could he handle that situation whom would he help yhvh only helped the israelites he was their tribal lord they were not allowed to take lifes but when he went to war as a leader they killed many thousands this is insane to whom did the british french german russian soldiers pray to the warlord of the old testament even jesus could not help them he was a jewish man and a wise man ! his message was de formed by the apostle saulus paulus to a kind of religion which we should not call christianity call it paulinism here now comes p von ward and we really should take his thoughts serious let us go away from narrow minded religous belief which only brought crusades wars and a kind of neurotic behavior we must discuss religion again we must become free from that god spell read freer it is time to understand how we became the species of homo sapiens sapiens thanks but no thanks to our creators anunnaki et al they did not teach us that they were not the transcendental gods but we are still devoted to them what a mess 
one of his best having read many of koontz s works i have found this to be one of his best i am biased though in that i appreciate koontz s use of psychology in his works while many if not most of his writings could be classified as psychological thrillers this work goes beyond in my opinion koontz has done his research and depicts in a very real way the fear and debilitation that a psychological disorder can cause that being said this book is not recommended for those with a tendency toward anxiety or excessive fear koontz s writing is very powerful and very real

a non scholarly review i really have the feeling that i am not knowledgable enough about the period in question in the thucydides to provide any kind of reasonable context for the work instead this review will focus on some reading tips and reactions aimed at the more generalist reader who may be attempting to get through the text first the text is daunting be patient with it and put it down if you need to it pays off i m not someone who reads battle scenes with absorption and still i found that if i absorbed the text in small enough doses then i was able to follow with interest second use the appendices at the back the explanations about the spartan and athenian leagues the greek monetary system and the melian dialogues were actually quite helpful in places for reading the text these appendices are provided in the penguin edition of the thucydides third take notes there are a lot of big thoughts and i found that i absorbed them better by writing them down for myself to think about later it is time consuming to attempt the history of the peloponnesian war it is also worth it to my mind i got a lot out of reading it even without being a historian with expertise in the time and region give it a try and give it the space that it deserves so it is now reasonable for us to hope that the gods will be kinder to us since by now we deserve their pity rather than their jealousy 
patterson switches up big time known for his murder mysteries patterson and co author andrew gross decided to try something new and have given us a fun fast paced adventure set in war torn medieval europe hugh de luc is a happily married innkeeper until he heads off to fight in the crusades the gruesome fighting and wanton disregard for life change and sicken him so he deserts and heads home only to find his wife taken captive and his infant son dead at this point patterson is on more familiar ground hugh de luc must find out who did it and try to bring him to justice unfortunately medieval customs and laws interfere with that search throw in some religious relics and a menacing group of french knights who believe they are condemned to hell and you have the indgredients for a fine book pattersons descriptions of medieval life ring true although the ending may not have worked out so well in a real medieval scenario nevertheless it was lots of fun and a big improvement over the women s murder club series i give this one a grade of a

thank you mr bassani william weaver s translation of giorgio bassani s novel is as faultless as a perfect tennis match played at high noon on a glorious spring day his choice of words is colloquial yet not dated to the point and limpid as the waters of an utterly still and silent lake looking through them you see the lost world of the finzi contini risen from the ashes glittering and new as if it had never perished and thank you mr bassani for bringing us back to the impossibly lovely yet gruesomely doomed italy of your youth there is much to think about here what becomes of the opportunity of love when not grasped in time the complex twists and turns of the human heart which barely understands itself let alone another the tragedy of irrepeatable human beings when they are destroyed by the invincible ignorance and rage of politicians possessing kindergarten imaginations and state oftheart weapons of repression giorgio bassani has created a world which is startlingly real one has the idea that should one stroll through ferrara today one could still hear the far off echo of tennis balls being whacked beyond a clump of trees on the other side of the finzi continis high wall on a deathless day in say long after the shouts of the dictators have died down these people live on through the curious and graceful immortality which is conferred upon them by this book meet them

a well paced and exciting nautical adventure story the third novel in the series a fourth is due out soon is the best one yet an exciting tale alive with history battles political turmoil courage and cowardice captain biddlecomb has developed into a seaworthy character who is brave cunning and much to his discomfort a patriot the regional distrust between northern and southern politicians were most interesting since most of the naval vessels were built crewed and sailed from northern ports the first contigent of marines was a superb touch as was the first landings on a foreign shore much insight into the actual sailing of ships positions of shore batteries fortresses local commanders were all presented in a fresh fashion an excellent read and am looking forward to the fourth novel as i mentioned in my reviews of the first two books far too many nautical terms that most landlubbers won t understand but some really terrific sea battles storms neferous characters and dialog i would like to see more books by mr nelson who really knows about sailing ships perhaps the war of the seminole war or something with the barbary pirates perhaps another nautical series could develope about the civil war featuring biddlecomb s son s that would be something to really look forward to

as much of a writer s manual as a riveting tale told by a master story teller i am not sure how i should classify on writing it is part memoir part guide or manual and part autobiography as a reader this book entertained me as a writer this book empowered me in a conversational tone king gives lessons and encouragement to beginner writers and struggling writers in this book but he manages to do so while telling his incredible story of hard work disappointment success and his tragic and almost fatal accident this is a book not only for aspiring writers like myself it also a book that any king fan must read or anyone that appreciates a good story 
essential reading for a classical education i read sophocles antigone for graduate humanities class it is an essential reading to understand greek tragedy it is also a foundation stone of literature in studying western civilization steiner s book was a great resource in understanding greek tragedy antigone daughter of oedipus in cycle play faces capital punishment for burying her brother who rebelled against thebes obeying instincts of loyalty of love and the divine law she defies creon the king and her uncle creon says laws of states outweigh all other laws and family loyalty when he finally relents it s too late over the centuries there has been a great deal made about the conflicts played out in the play law of state vs law of goods personal vs state duties loves knowledge vs state knowledge greek understanding of tragedy aristotle lays down understanding of greek tragedy he based it on sophocles tragedy most important thing for tragedy is plot it is all essential tragedy defined as is imitation of an action that is serious complete and of a certain magnitude in language embellished with incidents arousing pity and fear ant to the audience it accomplishes catharsis of such emotions every tragedy must have six parts that determine its quality plot character diction fault spectacle and melody according to aristotle tragedy is higher and more philosophical than history or poetry it is one of the highest expressive forms because it dramatizes what may happen history is a narrative that tells you what has happened tragedy shows what is possible history deals with particulars tragedy deals with the universal tragedy creates a cause and effect chain and shows how the world operates it frames human experience in universal discourse tragedy is central in this effort tragedy arouses pity and fear in audience because we can envision ourselves caught in this cause and effect chain plot most important feature the arrangement of incidents the way incidents and action is structured tragedies outcome depends on the outcome of these cause and effect changes not on being character driven plot must be whole beginning middle and end beginning must have a motivation that starts the cause and effect chain of events must be a center or climax that is caused by earlier incidents there must be an end some kind of closure caused by earlier events in tragedy this is all part of the complication of the tragedy all must be connected you can t have a dues ex machnia in a superior tragedy in tragedy the hero or heroine walks knowingly towards the fate that is written and can t be changed unity of action plot must be structurally self contained each action leading invariably to the next without outside intervention the worst kinds of plots are episodic like a jerry seinfeld sitcom can t be something about nothing must have unity of action magnitude quantatively meaning length and quality of action it must be serious must be of universal significance depth and richness character most important feature is the fatal flaw motivations of characters are important but character is there to support the plot character must be a prosperous renowned personage change of fortune from good to bad will really matter and bring fear and pity to the audience in ideal tragedy the hero will mistakenly bring about his own downfall because they make a mistake because knowledge of our selves is always partial we can t have complete knowledge of ourselves hall quotes descartes in the article the limited error prone perspective of the individual subject is always imperfect and human and these limitations include our ability to know in any reliable way ourselves the fact that we as subjects as agents can never fully know ourselves means that we are always prone to error error is the essence of the tragic hero tragedy is the essential drama of human subjectivity what is hegel s understanding of concept of tragedy he revises aristotelian principals and logic immensely influential german philosopher he writes about tragedy in the aesthete he proposes the suffering of the tragic hero are merely the means of reconciling the opposing moral clients according to hegel s account of greek tragedy the conflict isn t between good and evil but between competing goods all is good between two entirely ethical worlds that clash and can t come together both characters have an ethical vision or belief that they have to follow it is there one sidedness of their vision that clashes with the one sidedness of the other character both sides of contradiction are justified conflict of irreconcilable justifiable ethical worlds ethical visions just as his dialectic must lead to an ultimate synthesis so to must tragedy lead to a synthesis this is dramatized in the death of the tragic actor which becomes the synthesis hegel says the characters are too good to live they are too good to live in this world what is interesting is that hegel so wants to correct moral imbalances his emphasis is on moral balances greek tragedy is great reading for people interested in aesthetics history psychology and philosophy

the essential introduction to st century spirituality read this book and it will change your life perhaps in subtle ways perhaps profoundly how does seth compare to the celestine prophecy how about timeless wisdom compared to hack writin 
plenty of information but not for the jargon shy reader some facts dimensions x x inch actually printed on acid free paper and made to last containing articles averaging to pages per article typically to pages apart from the normal table of contents there is a o a thematic t oc and a glossary with definitions of specialized terms for the benefit of the general reader every article has an extensive reference section to facilitate further reading on the subject the articles themselves are rather scientific if you can hack this sentence from page both taxa share maxillae with subvertical ascending rami and cervical vertebrae with hypertrophied epipophyses then this book is for you every difficult word is contained in the glossary but that still doesn t make it good bedtime reading even more so because i do not find the book heavily illustrated the illustrations are mostly b ampw drawings diagrams or photographs with only a few pages of full color photographs or art work i estimate that more than half of the pages have no illustration at all 
one of my favorite read aloud book during elementary school when i was in kindergarten our teacher played the cassette for our class as she turned the pages of the book letting us hear the story as it unfolded it has left a lasting impression which i will pass to my kids i have wanted to get a copy of it because i loved the tongue twister name and i m happy to see amazon carries it i don t believe that it sends any negative messages like a few reviewers here the story starts off with the first born son tikki being all important while chang the second son is cast to a side however in the end chang is the hero and both children are important and loved it is a happy ending nowadays people get too sensitive and caught up with being pc this is a children s book meant to entertain and cause a few smiles it does that and even teaches that everyone is important and makes a difference almost years after having this story read to me it brings a smile to my face and fills me with warm memories of my childhood this book will be fun for both the child and reader the story sticks an important message into the minds of young ones who may be resistant to another approach in the end when the child grows up he she will remember the basic story but most of all the fun shared while reading the book i highly recommend tikki tikki tembo

hmmmf well i read it it s interesting material and watson is a good writer now back to whatever it was that i was doing 
interesting and original this is the story of a graphic design class except it really is a graphic design class our hero is enrolled in an art class at a state university and the offerings are at best sleepy until winter sorbeck graphic design teacher strides into the narrative and wakes everyone up the characterization of this charismatic brutal teacher is no less than masterful and also an interesting study in power and the dark sway of advertising you infect them with your obsessions chip kidd has a sharp sure way with language and tells the story of beleaguered art majors like no one has before the only drawback is an inconclusive ending a fizzled wreck that detracts from the rest of the story up until then though it s stars

battersea is the pinnacle of literary perfection this book in the wolves dido series is probably amoung the best it would be because of a outstanding characterization b amusing dialogue c beautiful british humour while the wolves of willoughby chase and nightbirds on nantucket are both worthy of accolades blackhearts in battersea is the funniest as most scottish readers would know in real history bonnie prince charlie tried to wrest the throne from the georgians aiken s use of twisted history is superbly amusing also the large pair of trousers cracks me up my only complaint is that sophie was too perfect and not enough human

must read for in depth understanding in depth though provoking reading for those seeking deep meaningful reflection 
informative if a little stuffy the author recommends the reader have several years of college level music training he uses harmonic melodic analysis as one would use in dissecting w a mozart et al in theory class this is an interesting and insightful approach that sometimes gets a bit too clever given the subject matter the author demonstrates genuine admiration for the beatles as composers poetsperformers but occasionally becomes condescending perhaps a product of his academic background on the other hand he seems to be very precise regarding who played what on which track thats interesting for a musician at any level all in all an engrossing work the more knowledge of music theory the reader possesses the more he she will enjoy this book 
brutally honest i admit to not being able to pick bill moyers out of a crowd so the fact that this was written by his son made very little difference to me what did make a huge difference however is the brutal honesty in this book william moyers is an addict and admits it he does not shy away from the that he did while in the throes of his addiction which makes this story of recovery all the more fascinating also really enjoyed his take on hazelden which i believe is often overlooked in the world of addictionn but is a god send thank you william for writing such a wonderful book of course it comes out of your pain but i am so grateful to you for sharing 
it was awsome and i learned so much i learned lots of different knots some i never even heard of plus it comes with all the things you need 
destruction and pain are the formula for lb apollyon what a mixed bag this book was it was typical left behind fare pages of theorizing agonizing and evil antichrist mischief in the face of god s chosen people but still things are slow in the lb universe at this point so while it is entertaining nothing really of note happens in this book nothing concrete anyway this is the book though where a lot of things get rolling though thumbs up for apollyon

a must for any fanatic that s exactly what stewart o nan and steven king are fanatics there are some criticisms out there that stewart s sections of the book are childish mudslinging that s true sure but there s no denying that o nan is a fanatic and has all his heart into the sox all of it batting practice autographs collecting various memorbilia he follows the sox the same way a child does there s something to be said regarding that and perhaps that s why baseball is america s part time men and children alike enjoy it on the same level stewarts accounts are analytical regarding each games highlights and lowlights i found steven king s writing to be less clinical and more insightful artistic personally i related to steven s sections better because i don t try to get to every game possible yet watch it on tv like it s religious evangelism i only recommend this book to a certain type of person one who loves the red sox or one who loves the pure sport of baseball reading this book for me was re living the entire sox season it was particularly fun when i got to games in the book in which i was in attendance and like the baseball season there are dog days of this book reading through at points it feels like the marathon that one baseball season is as a sox fan reading this book the payoff is so much fun reliving 
the all time best selling personal finance bible while many books have been written about personal finance none have had the initial and lasting impact as has this great classic by the late great charles j givens wealth without risk came out in late early no one knew these strategies nobody knew how to reduce their auto insurance no one that you could get a lower interest rate on your credit cards just by asking no one ever thought about using their home equity as an income stream only a l williams people where teaching the folly of investing in w hole life insurance nobody knew how car insurance and automobile dealers were ripping people off and no one knew how to really use their k plans at work or their ira tell someone you opened a self directed ira and they would say what the heck is a self directed ira they thought it was like a missile that was aimed at you nobody knew that you could make in mutual funds and invest without paying commissions and only a handful of us knew about tax liens certificates and discounted mortgages there were a few other financial authors out there like venita van caspel and robert allen only allen came close to offering the results givens offered and allen was limited to real estate investing i highly recommend robert allen as well although i would recommend the newer more wealth without risk over this older version the original wealth without risk is also packed with information that can positively impact your bottom line dont be surprised if you find resistance with certain financial people even though this book came out over years ago little in the financial world has changed when people have their hands in your pockets guess what their primary interest is hint it s not in your best interest that is for sure givens may be gone but he has left a legacy that has lived on like other great books wealth without risk will continue to sell for decades to come rip chuck and thank you ! 
an excellent guide for enhancing your strategic exploration this is actually the paperback version of future edge discovering the new paradigms of success by the same author in fact both books are sort of brief updates of the author s earlier book entitled discovering the business of paradigms written in the mid sdrawing essentially from the pioneering work of thomas kuhn who wrote the classic the theory of scientific revolutions in the s this author has very artfully expounded the concept of paradigm shifting in the world of business in contrast to the world of science from a strategic exploration viewpoint this is an excellent guide book understanding and mastering your paradigms is one important thing for making progress in life and in business but i personaly feel that the real essence of this book is succinctly captured by the author in the five strategic exploration tools outlined in the book the five tools are intended to help you to enhance your anticipation skills they are the real gems of the book bear in mind that the author is a process futurist unlike most other futurists who write books who are primarily content futurists the five specific tools mentioned in the book are the exact process tools to aid enhance your strategic exploration do not get carried away by the content part of the book pertaining to some perceived trends illustrated by the author in addition the author defines the concept of paradigm very well also elaborates at length on its key characteristics effects with illuminating examples he highlights the importance of paradigm shift anticipation i particularly enjoyed exploring the two specific thought provoking questions posed by the author what do i believe is impossible to do in my field but if it could be done would fundamentally change my business who outside my field might be interested in my unsolved problems by thinking about answering these two questions on your own against your own background you will begin to understand the essence of the author s proposition this will be the beginning of your own paradigm shift as it has happened in my own life design for the second half i would recommend readers to buy and read this book jointly with wayne burkan s wide angle vision wayne burkan has been a collaborator of joel barker and he introduces some more new and practical ideas to the paradigm phenomenon better still view also and learn more from the videos in which both authors are the lead facilitators the paradigm prism and the implications wheel which bring the whole paradigm concept to life and which showcase some more real world business examples if you want to explore your future read this book ! as the author puts it before you can create your future you must first explore it you must create and shape your future otherwise some one else will this is one of the very few books that have impacted my life design in the second half 
a wonderful train wreck having read several of ford s other novels previously i pretty much got what i had expected and had hoped for no need for outrageous plot twists chase scenes or bawdry dialogues the disintegration of this family showed me that people never stop growing learning and succumbing to not what is expected but what feels right at a particular point in one s life 
my mother my opinion it took me a while to get into this book there were several occasions where i tempted to give up on it im glad i stuck with it though those of you with a difficult mother daughter relationship will probably benefit from reading this book i know i did even though the author isn t a mother which does bother me a little i feel that her theories make sense the version i have of this book is quite old and was published in i picked it up in a used bookstore i m not sure what type of editing has been done on newer versions but i m sure the main message will be the same my mother my self would benefit women who would like a deeper understanding of their relationship with their own mother and also their daughters men might like to read this to understand the complex dynamics of these relationships 
a philosophy of interior design by s abercrombie there are very few books out there that combine quotphilosophyquot with quotinterior design quot for this reason alone abercrombie s book is a worthy contribution to the literature in interior design one trait of philosophical works is their tendency to identify broad but fundamental categories that together describe a particular reality i take this approach to be what the author means by quota philosophy of quot interior design that is to say abercrombie provides a menu of basic categories plan room planes levels ornament furniture art details etc and parses the reality of an interior built world through these lenses his examples are good and the book is well illustrated although some of the magic of interior experience is not conveyed by the black and white pictures another good aspect about this book is this the author is subtle in not making an arbitrary line of demarcation between quotinterior design quot and quotarchitecturequot even though his categories serve to focus on the topic of interiors it does so without disconnecting interior design from the domain of architecture in some artificial way and i think that is as it should be in other words this is a worthwhile book for both architects who sometimes forget about interiors and interior designers who sometimes forget about architecture as one who teaches design and has been in practice for many years i would consider this book a good fit for those just starting to learn about interior design and or those who are seasoned designers looking for something of a refresher on the fundamental nature of interior design as the title implies the book is not meant to be a quotnutsandboltsquot reference text for the practitioner it is more of a meditative reflection about the nature of the worlds that the design practitioner can create for others

truly written by a family man i too first saw this book at the public library and afterwards had to have it for my own this book has really given me a lot of range for cooking veggie most veggie cookbooks call for things you can only find in specialty stores and yield dishes that husbands nor children will touch i have really appreciatted a veggie cookbook that also comments on how to get you kid to like veggie food it made me happy to find a pizza section instead of some off the wall pizza recipe ! this is a great cookbook for veggie and non veggie families alike as it truly considers time taste and expense

wars of liberation the soul of battle compares three campaigns for lack of a better word that in the author s mind have very similar characteristics while the timing of this book it was written in and published initially in and the epilogue indicate that this book was written to either critique the limited war aims of the first gulf war or to urge in a rather abstract way the liberation of the iraqi people it is a fantastic read that will long outlast the current war in iraq mr hanson is viewed by many as an apologist for the neo cons but that does not detract from his ability to create an interesting thesis write a compelling narrative and imply multiple levels of interpretation in short this type of book is exactly what a classics or liberal arts education is supposed to be about this book does a great service by introducing epaminondas to the modern reader it seems a safe assumption that most moderately well educated americans knew nothing about this man until mr hanson published this book it also seems a reasonable assumption that boeotian democracy has further lessons for the modern americans one of the interesting characteristics of all three liberators shared is the fact that to a large extant they waged war not only on the army of the enemy but also his culture or soul one of the not so subtle points in mr hanson s writings is that not all cultures are equal or morally equivalent therefore it is necessary from time to time to beat back the evil that men do by destroying the culture and support infrastructure that makes such evil thrive however mr hanson seems to argue that evil can be completely vanquished the ancient greeks would say that evil is part of human nature and must be dealt with as necessary they would agree that one way to do so perhaps the most effective albeit horrifying terrible and costly way is war another interesting fact is that people who are liberated did not in statistically significant way participate in the fighting that liberated them to be sure the union raised hundreds of thousands of black troops epaminondas left behind former helots trained in war with walled cities and there were many partisan groups in france germany and poland the latter country also had jewish partisan groups that had fought from the first day of war until they were eventually disarmed by soviet forces yet the fact remains that none of these forces could have liberated themselves or been more than a nuisance on their own therefore these three conflicts are fundamentally different from revolutions where an outside entity intervened mr hanson is a bit unfair perhaps in his critique of gen eisenhower and gen bradley while gen patton was probably right that the battle of the bulge could have been exploited better it is just as likely that well trained and disciplined german troops could have opened their lines and let patton s striking force go past and then close the lines to block his fuel and ammo support this is something they did time and time again to russian forces on the eastern front as the german forces declined in mobility and firepower indeed this is often the only effective tactic left to forces that either lost or never had the mobility required for modern warfare in the end this book is typical of mr hanson s other works highly readable interesting thesis and based on a solid grounding of history and traditional intellectual discourse this book is highly effective and worth reading 
bridget jones devil wears prada all good the second assistant was not what i expected it was far better at first i thought it would be a low grade version of bridget jones diary or the devil wears prada and while second assistant definitely showed similarities to both novels it proved itself as a story all it s own i loved lizzie and all the odd hollywood friends that she made as she learned the ropes of the industry i was delighted by the outlandish stories of l a many of which i have heard to be true i loved that while this book was classified at chicklit it didn t feel fluffy maybe zany and crazy at times but never unintelligent i was especially enamored with the fact that the romantic element of the story did not really come into play until the second act of the book and that it did not overshadow the other enticing plot lines i was also intrigued by the abrupt yet conclusive ending and look forward to reading the follow up novel the first assistant i read this novel primarily while on vacation visiting a friend who recently moved to hollywood and found it to not only be a great source of entertainment but also an accurate source on where to go as it is chocked full of references to popular l a landmarks naylor hare did a great job and i highly recommend the second assistant to others ! 
a hero is born after watching daniel craig s bond debut the most compelling action movie i ve seen in years i felt the urge to go back and reread ian fleming s casino royale i did so with some trepidation that this book which wowed me as a teenager would fall flat under my middle age sensibilities to my relief i enjoyed the book nearly as much as the movie but for quite different reasons fleming s writing style a mixture of raymond chandler s hard boiled cynicism and hemingway s heroic machismo forms the image of the real bond that filmmakers have been struggling for decades to capture fleming s bond is a handsome man love interest vesper lynd compares his looks to the s era musician hoagy carmichael whose handsomeness is tempered by his cold calculating demeanor not to mention a nasty scar on the side of his face he s also a complex philosophical man with sophisticated tastes in food and drink interesting theories on gambling and luck and a fierce loyalty to the british secret service which he comes to question in a lively philosophical exchange with mathis at the end of the book the film adaptation takes considerable liberties with the plot updating this cold war spy novel to suit the threats of today s world le chiffre becomes indebted to a terrorist organization rather than a soviet intelligence agency wireless electronic gadgets take the place of blunt weapons and texas hold em displaces baccarat at the casino s high stakes table the movie also adds a number of action sequences that play much better on the screen than would the many introspective passages of the novel daniel craig though more muscular looking and acting than i picture fleming s bond channels the cold calculating manner of this english assassin much better than brosnan or even connery i m looking forward to the next installment in this revitalized film franchise and may even continue rereading fleming s series

good book this book tells a legend about the gift of giving it is set in mexico close to christmas time all the families are preparing their gifts for the baby jesus one family is making a special blanket for the baby however the mother gets too sick and she cannot finish the beautiful blanket so the family will have no gift to give on christmas so the young daughter tries to finish the blanket but ruins it beyond repair so she hides from the rest of the town s people and does not go to church on christmas while everyone else is walking into church baring their gifts the young girl watches from afar however while there she encounters an old lady who teaches her a valuable lesson the young girl learns that it is not the gift that you give but the thought that you have put into it and the mere gesture of giving the author gets the point across about gift giving so well i came away from this book remembering and understand that it is truly the thought that counts and not the gift itself

interesting collection of essays while this book contains essays on the lesser discussed women of dada it also covers gender and identity in dada including marcel duchamp it is also worth pointing out that while most of the women covered are dadaists not all are specifically georgia o keefe doesn t really fall into the dada category i would recommend this for those interested in the intersection of gender and early twentieth century art

entertaining educational and disturbingly accurate this book contains espionage techniques that has shocked a former kgb major general with its accuracy as he d spent twenty years trying to figure out this stuff during the cold war each tactic and method some amusing others possibly illegal such as how to determine leaks in your company how to determine mail tampering how to use cellphones as eavesdropping tools and how to infiltrate your competitors meetings all come with little true life examples of similar tactics being used in the field as with similar books like the worst case scenario series do no try this at home and the action hero ines handbooks it s all for entertainment purposes only but it does make for excellent research material

response to other reviews alright seeing quotthis book should be on the shelf next to roger penrose s the emperor s new mind and james gleick s chaosquot and another review saying that the book denies godel s theorom confused me for a while then i realized that the latter refered to nueral nets assuming that the nets referred to are analog there is no contradiction godel s theorom proved the incompleteness of formal language systems a ka digital systems which constitute a smaller information set than analog systems mathematically analog systems do not meet the neccessary conditions for godel s proof to apply however the claim to completeness if it be made is ungrounded analog systems simply represent a higher information dimension not an infinite information dimension

let s talk about love let s talk about loveanger kidnapping explicit sex drugs these words describe just a few of the many topics that a reader can find in han nolan s born blue what the reader can expect from nolan s novel is a heart gripping exciting journey of a young girl trying to find out what life and love are really all about born blue is a story of a journey the main character janie takes janie has been in the foster care program since she was very young and although her mother is still alive disturbing circumstances do not allow her to care for janie our protagonist finds herself caught up in a whirlwind of events as she is kidnapped moved from place to place taken advantage of and gets pregnant all the while janie has only her two passions to keeps her going her love for the ladies aretha franklin ella fitzgerald etta james etc and her hunger to become a famous singer herself move her along through the novel at such a young age janie is scarred by the abandonment of her mother and therefore throughout the novel it appears that she eventually pushes away those that really care for her she finds love in her friend harmon harmon s family and others she meets along the way such as cliff and paul yet each time it s as if janie is going to push them away before they have a chance to leave her as her mother did instead she finds her refuge in famous singers she does not even know rather than in actual relationships with other people her vision of what love is and what life is about are severely obscured and it is not until one major event in her life that finally seems to open her eyes to reality what is striking about this novel is the way that nolan is able to make the reader both love and hate the main character so much one gets a feeling that he or she is growing up with janie and as a result the reader longs for janie to make decisions that will better her life when she makes the wrong ones nolan has written in such a way that the reader can easily become angry and could almost yell out loud at the girl running in the wrong direction the development of each character in fact is done so that readers can easily enter into the world of the novel without a doubt adolescent readers will be drawn into this book with the risky topics and high point of action nolan will have young readers hooked on the plot and characters in born blue i believe that there is someone or some event that each and every young person can relate to and find him or herself in even if the reader s life does not hold so many dramatic life changing events in it he or she can relate to the feelings of being alone and sometimes seemingly unloved or the feelings of worrying about a friend in trouble also with the attachment to the characters as mentioned before the adolescent reader can almost develop a sense of what it is like to be a parent or authority figure who is just hoping for the best outcome basically what it comes down to is that han nolan s born blue is an enjoyable fun stay on the edge of your seat type of novel that any reader will enjoy and be eager to keep reading till the end

he was one of us of all the great novelists and writers of english joseph conrad was one of the most pessimistic his view of human nature was not encouraging or to use modern jargon life affirming like shakespeare he always sought to look under the mask to remove the polite smile of civilization and expose the red toothy maw beneath he often sent his characters into the interior a jungle always described as a black green hell hot and dripping where man was free to release the bloody and awful god within lord jim follows this pattern to an extent although in this novel the character struggles to be honorable and kind in a nutshell an english officer young handsome and noble is terribly disgraced and struggles to restore his honor the storyteller in the novel marlowe is the same character conrad used to tell heart of darkness it is the relationship between marlowe and jim the young officer which provides the most fascinating element in the work marlowe meets jim during the latter s military hearing where jim is desperate to tell someone the story of his disgrace marlowe a merchant captain coincidentally in port reluctantly hears him out this event establishes a deep psychological bond between the two men that courses through the book it is through this relationship that conrad explores some of the fundamental assumptions of human nature is man basically good and honorable is there even such a thing as honor or good or is every belief we cherish about ourselves a thin chimera shredded easily by the base nature within certainly there are few honorable characters in lord jim one of the great treats of the book is the flotsam of humanity that conrad skillfully parades before the reader take as an example the merchant chester one of many who offer jim extremely dubious work once he is in disgrace in this case overseer of an island that produces tons of bat guano which has great commercial value or chester s right hand man captain holly terror robinson described thusly the notorious robinson the man who smuggled more opium and bagged more seals in his time than any loose johnny now alive they say he used to board the sealing schooners up alaska way then the fog was so thick that the lord god he alone could tell one man from another holy terror robinson that s the man he is with me on this guano thing he put his lips to my ear cannibal well they used to give him the name years and years ago yet there remains something that makes marlowe care about jim something he is at pains to understand himself the fascinating thing is that most of the time marlowe is nearly repulsed or irritated by jim made squeamish about shaking his hand or will cross a street to avoid him there is a quality in jim s disgrace that dims marlowe s own cherished memories of youth and high adventure yet as marlowe says repeatedly jim was one of us this phrase changes bit by bit in the course of the novel at first it means primarily white english and of a certain class as the novel progresses the phrase begins to take on a much broader meaning touching something fundamental in all living men as marlowe puts it in describing jim woe to the stragglers ! we exist only in so far as we hang together he had straggled in a way he had not hung on but he was aware of it with an intensity that made him touching just as a man s more intense life makes his death more touching than the death of a tree i happened to be handy and i happened to be touched that s all there is to it again like shakespeare nothing is obvious and much is open to interpretation does jim succeed in regaining his honor there in a remote jungle did he fail or perhaps was he aiming his shot at a romantic tendril of air never really there at all if you read this great work you will have the pleasure of deciding for yourself mykal banta

a solid excellent book this book roots in a majesterial examination of the documentary records of the warren commission and the fbi a product of careful hard work conducted over the decades of the type seldom met with in most histories today and rarely in the jfk inquiry in addition it is well written the results are devatating to the coverup inflicted upon the american people by the warren commission it should be noted that four of the members of the warren commission did not believe their own report nor did lbj the district attorney of dallas the police chief of dallas and even the fbi and the secret service as the documentary record shows beyond cavil russell and cooper members of the wc did not believe the sbt for example and left records to the fact further interviews with the head of the secret service and warren commission records prove the commission and its staff saw the x rays and medical photographs some as early as december it is unquestionable that the wc and its chief counsel rankin early on january worked with this knowledge e g jan executive session of the wc to argue otherwise is blindly to accept and faithfully to reiterate the political devices employed by investigators as they realized late in their investigation that they had to coverup their nefarious actions and leave a pious paper file that to scholars is further affirmation of their failure breach of trust s objective and scholarly presentation will assist the reader to understand the workings of the wc and lead an inquiring mind to the light mcknight s unique book ought to become the standard reference to the crime for decades to come

engaging and readable schivelbusch s tastes of paradise provides a refreshingly light hearted yet engaging glimpse at some of the substances which through our stomachs lungs and palates have played a not insignificant role in personal and cultural interactions of european civilizations concentrating primarily on western societies between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries schivelbusch devotes over pages to each of the subjects of coffee tobacco and alcohol he also includes ample discussion of the historical role of chocolate spices and nineteenth century opiates i read this book as part of a college level world history class middle ages present and found it to be an enjoyable and worthwhile complement to novels primary sources and textbook readings we studied spread out in small doses over the course of the semester it provided an unusual vantage point from which major themes such as industrialism christianity romanticism and social class structures could be more readily understood over black andwhite reproductions of period art enhance schivelbusch s lively discussion of the material without suggesting that these substances played an unrealistically inflated role in history schivelbusch offers a highly accessible discussion equally suitable for the student or casual reader 
a tragic upbringing what is more intriguing in the novel is not only how the protagonist was a product of her society s objectification of women but how she was brought up to be that way wharton exposes not only the frivolous society of her time she exposes the tragedy of women who were raise without any sense of self preservation and self reliance lily bart cannot live in a world deprived of opulence and must be mercenary to attain what she desires most wharton s work is perceived as lengthy at times however what the reader must realize throughout the story is that wharton was alluding against her own society s upbringing of women 
more than i bargained for i was figuratively rubbing my hands together as i started this book a pulitzer prize winner that would be a continuation of little women excellent writing i got a pleasant story i did not agreeing that pleasant stories are often only that despair erupted when coming face toface with the double insanities of war and slavery i was a bit beaten up during the reading process and could not help but compare march s world to our own the civil war soldiers march included idealized the struggle and convinced themselves that is was morally necessary to fight this quickly faded when they began to experience death destruction and the senselessness of the war and the soldiers changed and the change was for the worst we can only hope that march and the soldiers fighting around the world today are able to come home physically emotionally and spiritually i am not so sure

the big we as opposed to the me me me world great great book for monastics like me very akin to spirit friend interaction unlike the author mark macy i am new to itc and the luminator but then again i need not know the ins and outs of how my car works to take me where i care to go besides we all like pictures from which to consider and learn more easily i offer the idea that much like chanting and mozart effect physical and mental stillness so to go beyond so must the luminator to me this book is a very special bridge for the physical egomind which has been closed by rational thought to conscious essence and the possibilities therein of thought conversation think talking and traveling yes in the dismal egocentered realms of life such things are not possible due to the many narrow or exculsionary perspectives therein but just take a look at what this man knows and is sharing with the world in this book wow ive never met mark macy nor did i know of itc before this read but i find it very very interesting that i have learned over the years the same interactive process of which he writes by leaving the slug like egomind realm and exploring some of my best friends no longer have a physical form are honest beyond measure and exist to create more of the same and they know this read this book consider the possibilities it places before you feel the buzz it creates in you i dare you ! what no buzz you say lordy lordy still packing way too much egomind resistance for this new paradigm open up your intention and throttle down the fear one way or another you ll get there

a fun way to really learn adobe premiere elements all of the effects in this book are interesting and each is laid out in an easy to read fashion first shown for each effect is a list of files you will need from the cd laid out in a box entitled media next is a table with complexity skill level and materials labeling the rows within the row what applies to this effect is labeled in bold print next is a box labeled what you ll do this is a broad overview of the steps you will take to create the effect this is followed by a few paragraphs of introduction that talk about the effect the rest of the pages on each particular effect go into details on each step in the what you ll do box all the instructions are heavily illustrated with screenshots of the application so you can easily follow along the final entry for each effect involves an image that shows what your film should look like if you performed the steps correctly the effects mentioned are quite interesting and are as follows with a chapter dedicated to each one chapter the see through title effect the film is given a title and you can see a scaled version of the underlying film coloring the title chapter the retro title effect gives the opening and closing titles a s look chapter the star wars opening sequence effect gives opening credits that scroll like they did in star wars chapter the passing of time effect emulate the passing in time by deleting frames and using dissolveschapter the fast times effect shows the world rushing by your subject as he or she moves in normal time thereby communicating a world of information about the character and story chapter the reverse action effect film motion goes in reverse chapter the pencil sketch effect your film looks like it was sketched with a pencil like photoshop chapter the watercolor painting effect make the film appear as painted by watercolor like photoshop chapter the faded film effect use dust scratches and faded color to make your film look old chapter the nightly news effect adds titles graphics and logos to make your film look like a newscast chapter the effect the picture inpicture effect popular on the show chapter the beam me up effect simulates the transporter effect popular on star trek chapter the night vision effect makes your film look like it s being viewed through night vision goggles chapter the hidden identity effect pixelizes certain areas on the screen to hide the identities of people as is done on crime shows chapter the bleeping effect a pure sound effect that puts a bleeping sound where speech should be chapter the enchanted elf effect shows you how to shrink and add color to someone and place them in a video so they appear to be an elf of some kind chapter the friendly ghost effect change opacity and other features to give a character the appearance of a ghost chapter the multiple you effect placing multiples of the same individual in the same frame so that they can interact with one another in a natural fashion chapter the super hero effect gives a character in your film the appearance of flying around like superman chapter the around the world effect how to use premiere elements to brighten your traveller and help match the actor to the background clip useful if the sun is shining from the west in your background travel clip but the narrator has the sun coming from the opposite direction this is a very easy to follow book that deals not only with just artistic effects but common problems a filmmaker might run across in fact by learning how to execute these effects you ll learn skills that will translate well into your other editing projects that have no apparent special effects purpose to them this is because while these effects projects take advantage of color and sound techniques for slight of hand effects they utilize the same techniques that you would use to correct the colors in an oversaturated video clip or to get the colors to match in two clips that were shot under different lighting conditions by following the instructions in this book you ll learn to think about timing splitting clips matching audio to video syncing clips and other concepts that until now you might not have given much thought to these projects will teach you about premiere elements in a way that no other book can while having a good bit of fun along the way i highly recommend it to anyone interested in using adobe premiere elements for film editing 
standard translation of landmark text note this is the edition i m familiar with but it s out of print there are new editions both with this translation and newer ones that would be worth checking out this one has no real guide or preface but i kind of like that norman kemp smith s translation seems to be one of the standard english translations of kant s critique of pure reason is it the best i don t speak german but it s certainly serviceable this is a daunting work it s also a necessary work inasmuch as any understand of contemporary thought and intellectual history must encounter it kant has influenced nearly every major school of thought and cultural trend for the last years below i ll try to sketch his thought in this critique this is the story of immanuel kant who found philosophy a mess and sought to fix it specifically he was a former rationalist who was disconcerted by the critique of british empiricism specifically the skeptical philosophy of david hume he sought to provide a grounding for the truths of empirical science and mathematics establish the possibility of religious faith and practice while at the same time avoid dogmatism in metaphysical reasoning how did he seek to do this by establishing a critique of reason whereby he understands the validity of all mental constructs kant distinguish between judgments which are a priori prior to experience and a posteriori arising out of experience and judgments which are analytic trivial tautological and synthetic where the predicate adds something that is not contained within the subject are synthetic a priori judgments possible kant answers yes and much of this book deals with what follows from that first kant deals with how we have sense experience he claims that space and time are necessary a priori conditions for sense experience not physical things in the world the content of our experience is sense data raw sensation that arises outside ourselves or inside ourselves and is given in experience the forms in which we construct that experience are space and time sensations organized within us spatially and temporally yields sense experience perceptionskant then proceeds to our abstract thought what he terms understanding has pure a priori concepts according to logical form he calls these categories these do not arise as a mere empirical habit convention they are prior to experience and are necessary forms that allow rational beings to experience the world intelligibly thus we take the raw givens of our understanding which are perceptions which we dealt with under transcendental aesthetic and we impose the categories upon these perceptions we schematize our experience perceptions given intelligible form according to schemata yield intelligible concepts we are justified in doing this because the perceptions are not things inthemselves but mere appearances phenomena and in order for these phenomena to exist in an experience that is coherent and consistent for us they must have these forms we are not justified in applying these categories to things inthemselves noumenathis is where reason eats itself it tries to do the same thing the understanding did but now it does this with respect to the big metaphysical questions it starts with concepts and attempts to unify all phenomenal experience according to concepts and yield the ideas of pure reason when it does this it gets all confuzelled it tries to deal with big problems kant uses the term dialectic soul reason wants to insist that the thinking soul exists that it is subject pure substance that it is simple and that it is unchangeable through all its activities these are the paralogisms of pure reason we need these ideas their contraries are unthinkable for us but these are not demonstrable the world reason wants to answer questions about the series of appearances that constitute the world is the world limited or unlimited in space and time is the world made up of simples or composites does freedom exist in the world is there a necessary being connected with the world these are the antinomies of pure reason unlike the paralogisms these questions admit of contradictory answers they too cannot be adjudicated by pure reason god reason wants to demonstrate the existence of god kant refers to this as the ideal of pure reason he claims that all arguments demonstating god s existence in fact despite outward appearances depend upon one method the ontological proof of god s existence which kant disallows as transempirical kant tries to tell us how to employ reason first stop arguing speculatively about god etc but he urges us to apply those metaphysical ideas must be employed in practical moral contexts in this he anticipates the victorians who were somewhat skeptical on matters of faith but stressed the necessity of continuing to act according to traditional morality the dialectic problems deals with ideas are not verifiable speculatively they are not constitutive of experience rather they serve a regulative function specifically in the practical realm of morality kant claims that reason is architectonic it naturally wants to assume the greatest generality kant says this is fine for moral thinking but bad for speculative thinking kant says that philosophy answers these questions what can i know what ought i to do what may i hope for the bulk of critique of pure reason answers the first question the critique of practical reason groundwork of the metaphysic of morals metaphysic of morals etc answer the second question the third question ties the two together this is what kant deals with at the end of the first critique kant sees the great transendental ideas as being god immortality and freedom they are the starting points of theistic religion eg christianity and judaism these can neither be verified nor disproved by speculative reason since speculative reason must by its nature deal with givens latin data either from sense experience or pure intuition as in mathematics these ideas however are necessary regulative ideas for the guidance of practical moral reason and are valid in that connection thus the second critique answers the question what ought i to do by recourse to the transcendal idea of freedom the question what may i hope for is given response through the transcendental ideas of god and immortality for if god does not exist nothing can grant us happiness for moral behavior and unhappiness for immoral behavior and if we re not immortal god won t have anyone to reward i probably have made errors and inaccuracies in the above but i hope i give a flavor for his thought kant is sober earnest and disciplined again he s not easy but i think he s worth the effort

elisha watson book report rules of the road this is a great book for ages and up joan bauer has mad another great book i could relate to it a lot from the family being divorced to not knowing much about the rules of the road it takes place in chicago illinois during the hot summer jenna boller is the best employee at her branch of gladstone s shoes she can sell anybody anything she is sixteen yearsold and has had her driver s license for six months but her family problems are harder to handle especially her drunk dad and there are times when jenna wishes she could just get out of town and take a break her dad is a drunk and embarrases at her job so when madeline gladstone the elderly president of gladstone s shoe stores hire jennna as her driver for the summer to take her from chicago to dallas jenna leaps at the chance right in the driver s seat and that begins a cross country adventure they learn a lot about the rules of the road and the rules of life jenna is having a nice time driving mrs gladstone around and spending nights at the hottest hotels and most expensive places to eat mrs gladstones son is wanting to take over the business because he says that his mother needs to slow down and enjoy the rest of her life the only problem is that her son elden and her aren t very close with relationship and so they don t talk a lot elden only cares about the money not the customers he will try to sell you anything no matter the price or how it feels on your feet later in a couple of weeks they are going to have a meeting where people will vote and decide who should still be president over gladstone s shoes jenna meets henry bender the best shoe seller in texas jenna only knows him for about a week and it s like he becomes her own father she never really had a dad who took care of her since he was drunk all the time she mostly took care of him then some disturbing news happen mr bender was killed in a car accident hit head on by a drunk driver jenna s heart is crushed the real conflict of the story is that right before the meeting that determines who is the president elden captures jenna and gets a plane ticket back home he takes her to a taxi cab and leaves to the meeting she tells the taxi to turn around and go back to the meeting she sneaks in and stops everything she gives a speech and lets everyone know that elden is just looking for money instead of quality everyone votes for mrs gladstone to stay the president ! as jenna and mrs gladstone arrive home jenna thinks to herself all this time she has bent over backwards for her dad and was scared to hurt his feelings for not wanting to see him since he is drunk all the time then she realizes that it doesn t matter what her dad wants she has been their when he wasnt and she hasn t gotten anything for it she understands now she wondered why her dad had to be a acoholic now she knew it was to make her stronger different and most importantly it showed her how to say no in the darkness this was a powerful yet hilarious book i will most likely read it again and never forget it

excellent home cookbook for arab families the arab table by may s bsisu a native of kuwait the wife of a palestinian and resident of lebanon for several years and current resident of cincinnati is a personal account of arab cooking based less on scholarship than on her experiences and experiences of her family and close friends that is the title is just a bit misleading if it gives the impression that it is a systematic study of arab cuisine it is much more like suzanne dunaway s rome at home or mario batali s recipes from my two villages than it is a study such as paula wolfert s books or claudia roden s the new book of middle eastern food one minor caveat i may mention is that ms bsisu is remarkably candid about the amount of help she got in putting this book together one gets the feeling that the only thing she wrote herself is the recipe headnotes and an outline of the recipes credit for almost everything else is given to co authors copy editors and recipe testers that means that i will be cautious before buying any other titles by ms bsisu as her work is much more the work of a committee than a single person i am really happy to see a book on this subject being published by a major american house as just about any information on the arab culture leaking out to the american hinterland will repair the damage done by recent terrorists i do feel the author is just a bit too focused on her ethnic good points when she praises arab hospitality suggesting that maybe other ethnic groups are just a bit less friendly one can read very similar comments about the italians the greeks the mexicans the spanish and the amish just to name a few one thing which immediately strikes me about many of these recipes is how similar they are to greek cooking yoghurt olive oil lemons flatbreads lamb spinach eggs eggplant kebabs and chickpeas are all straight out of the greek cuisine the greek turkish and arab cuisines even share the same mezes traditions although the arabs would generally take their snacks with coffee rather than with wine one thing that this similarity helps is the fact that greek raw materials are so easy to find in the united states at least in major metropolitan centers one can easily convert conventional yoghurt into mediterranean style yoghurt one only needs to find a source for sumac a pepper like spice with a lemony taste that is unique to middle eastern cooking the one application for which this book is really superb is as a cookbook for an arab family living in the united states or other english speaking country and who does not have a strong arab culinary tradition of their own on which to fall back the arabic name is given for every dish and most of those names are unfamiliar to me except for the obvious such as taboulleh my mediterranean culinary scholarship may not be as good as it should be but i have some suspicion that some dishes in this book are not truly arab even if they have arab names my greatest suspicion falls on those dishes from morocco even though morocco has been an islamic culture for close to years i think the natives of the madgreb are more berber than arab otherwise most of the dishes seem to come from kuwait lebanon and palestine there is some egyptian influence from the sinai but this isn t arab either one thing that makes this an excellent book for the amateur especially the amateur with an arab background is that there is a very nice balance of easy and complicated recipes including several very good recipes for arab flatbreads and the recipes are well written giving a substantial amount of detail probably more than you may find in more scholarly books or books from large area surveys as you may find from for example elizabeth david highly recommended as a source for arab home cooking

overall an interesting read the premise of this book is captivating and i read it almost immediately after seeing dr zimbardo on the daily show where i learned of it the first rds of this book are fascinating particularly the account of the stanford prison experiment and subsequent experiments regarding the human capacity for evil i greatly admire zimbardo but the book is not what i expected the first of the book is psychological and it seems to me that the last is more historical and political i started to lose interest during the analysis of abu ghraib because it was just repeating the concepts we had learned earlier in the book and was no longer new and intriguing the book was just way too long period to cover the same themes deindividuization dehumanization etc etc i wanted more from this book than it delivered but it was still worth reading 
right on target which explains her success as a partner with jack welch ro has hit the nail on the head here it s not really about keeping his favorite yogurt on tap or catering to his needs it s about removing the obstacles and the minutiae so that the leadership can lead instead of wasting time on those things that can be done by others it s more about being a true partner than it is about being a sterotypical assistant my take on this book is that although written by an assistant it is applicable to anyone who has a boss and who wants to be a solution instead of just an employee many people take issue with being asked to handle things that they deem are personal for thier boss that conversation is a waste of time and will be a deciding factor on how high you will go in your career make no mistake for leaders of large organizations there is no distinction between a personal and a work life they are one so ro really points out that being a solution for jack sometimes meant that she had to make sure those personal things were managed to completion by someone other than jack that freed jack up to take care of business premanaging your boss is a great way to bring speed to the entire organization ro stated early on that she was a creator of time that is one of the most powerful offers that one can make to their boss and their organization time is the most precious asset that many of us claim to not have enough of by ensuring that jack didn t have to sweat the small stuff and sift through unneccessary crap she was able to create the time for jack to become the leader he is and to bring more prosperity to the organization and the people who support it be it personal or business she handled it observe also that while many may think of rosanne badowski as just an assistant who wrote a book she obviously has enough insight and leadership skills of her own to be the assistant of one of the most powerful ceo s for years and she wrote a book about it i am also quite sure that she has enjoyed some prosperity as a result of her success with jack

a profound opening into the origins of love and culture i am sorry to be so blunt about this but previous reviewers sierra and whomi do not appear to have really grasped winnicott s work in this book sierra really has no clue at all i have to respond at some length but better to just read the book winnicott henceforward dww creates in an enormous leap away from freud a vision of the complex and beautiful relationship of the infant and primary caregiver in fact he speaks of the mother infant dyad rather than two separate persons during the first few months of life from this union if all goes well the child gradual emerges and develops a sense of self through a process of disillusionment by the mother in doses the infant can withstand as this occurs the child symbolizes the lost union with the mother in what dww calls transitional objects and begins with the comfort of these objects to begin to play in what dww calls the potential space we might call it the realm of culture of love and of religion only with successful caregiving does the child have a chance to fully develop as a person and dww shows in loving detail and case histories how this happens through the devotion of the mother this is why dww s work is vital not merely to psychoanalysts but to every person on this planet his work has influenced two generations of therapists theorists and educators and indirectly every one of us further his work has increasingly been supported by developmental insights gained from attachment theory and other experimental and verifiable studies i don t normally write reviews on amazon com but i could not let foolish misreadings by other reviewers stand unchallenged sierra s attitude is not only condescending it is lazy enough said as for whomi i appreciate the thought there but dww does allow for gradual disillusionment through experience of the external world if whomi missed it that does not mean it is not there as for using derrida to read dww i imagine that is useful go to it if you like but let s not forget that the work of lacan is inconceivable without dww and the work of derrida inconceivable without lacan dww indisputably and deservedly stands as one of the most influential psychological thinkers of the th century further his use of language is simple and yet always provocative finding new depth and meaning in the simplest of words please consider reading dww and judge for yourself franz metcal 
more than simply stimulus response psychology anyone who accuses b f skinner of championing a mechanistic stimulus response psychology needs to read this book ! in it skinner takes the reader on an exercise in looking at the world and our place in it through the lenses of personal learning history and the cultural context influencing what is important primarily euro americanbut one can only handle so many things at once although as other reviews have written some of the terms and circumstances date the book the themes contained within remain valid

author s response to reviewer from fair oaks ca ruggs recommendations on the colleges is the best selling book in the country for giving the student a starter list of quality departments at quality colleges this is the focus of the book if one is looking for college descriptions you go a college book that focuses on college descriptions not a book that focuses on college majors in the years that my book has been available very few days have gone by that a customer has not told us that the book is extremely useful if one reads the four page introduction one will note that schools should be added to the student s list by his her counselor from the counselor s own knowledge of the student and knowledge of other colleges that might fit match the student fred rugg autho

sing it sister finally a woman writer attempting to help women ! regardless of her political preferences one can not ignore the convicing arguments establishing how so many liberal democrat powerhouses do indeed attempt to suppress other women s happiness regardless of your political affiliation if you are a woman and seek to be happy you should read this book in order to get the full benefit you will need to devoid yourself of emotion and drama and read this objective non fiction book as purely factual although this is very difficult for women to do it is possible and although you may feel as if the author is attacking you she is not stick with it and you will realize she is one of very few women powerhouses who are actually on your side whether you want to be happy is up to you happiness is not defined by others it is defined by yourself you may try to appear to others as though you are happy but if you desire the deep down contentment read this with an open mind it is about the best therapy you can reap 
so funny you will laugh at loud barbara park the author of this book and the entire junie b series has a writing style like no other her way of getting kids wanting to read through the real true to life stories of the kindergartener and first grader junie b jones is fantastic barbara park and her junie b books are consistently on the both the new york times and the usa today bestseller lists as of this date their are books in the junie b series with the newest being junie b dumb bunny and this being the second newest we have this book in the hard cover edition that has a paper cover sleeve and attached red satin ribbon bookmark for easily holding your current page santa left this in my then six year old s stocking the christmas before last it had just come out that previous month of junie b jones were the first chapter books that my daughter started reading she was captivated by them as most kids this age are they don t tell of a sticky sweet child but rather of the true to life hardships from the kid s view that a determined opinionated and sometimes frantic girl she has some of the funniest moments in this book that my daughter and i burst out laughing at junie b likes to do things her own way and expects the world to pretty much revolve around her of course it doesn t and the trouble starts in the end junie b learns a little bit anyway how to handle things in this book it christmas time as the title suggests the first grade classroom is getting ready for the holiday and the celebrations to come they are learning and singing holiday songs and wearing elf costumes all of which are extremely exiciting to junie b as we have learned through previous books a classmate may is not exactly one of junie b s favorite people this time may has become a tattletale that is ruining the fun for junie b the part that stops junie b in her tracts and just may destroy this whole holiday season is that she draws may s name in the secret santa exchange that classroom number one is having junie b comes up with a plan to get back may through the gift she plans on giving her as usual things don t turn out as junie b has planned the books has pages with chapters their are usually about two illustrations per chapter these are done in black and white print the illustrator denise brunkus perfectly captures the emotions of the fun and frustration of junie b but it s the cleverly written words that draw you in and make you feel like you can feel not only junie b s joy but also her pain she s is not quite the kid that you want your child to emulate but just the same a kid can learn from junie b s problems that they are likely to encounter at some point in there grade school career must have !

great entertaining colorful my yearold loves this book i took a chance and ordered it without reading much about it but what a great find she wants it read to her at least a few times a week the pictures are delightful and the story is adorable the refrain what a scare jesse bear is so fun for a child to say every couple of pages and gets him her involved in the story 
one of the greats of american literature i hate to reiterate a common point made by many reviewers but i feel it s necessary to say once again that the middle of the book was some hard reading it wasn t hard vocabulary wise but because dreiser went into great detail about carrie and hurstwood separately and as a couple among many other things so much so that it could have been its own novel it has the potential to lose people who are short on patience perhaps five chapters could have been combined into two if that ! be that as it may roughing it through the middle makes getting to the end feel as if you ve accomplished the impossible and your effort will be rewarded the ending was unconventional to say the least not to give it away but if a potential reader believes that dreiser tied things up quite nicely think again ! such an ending is a present day writing teacher s nightmare i must confess that as i was reading the book i was simultaneously checking out the reviews here on amazon and was prepared to feel really sorry for hurstwood from what i understand hurstwood s deterioration is the main attraction of the book and of the movie adaptation made in the s after seeing how he tricked carrie into leaving chicago with him first going to canada and then settling in new york how he was a bigamist throwing that in carrie s face at the appropriate moment and how utterly unprepared he was to fight his wife and live a new life in a new town i wound up not feeling as sorry for hurstwood as is expected to be his lack of motivation and the lies on which he built his life with carrie were of his own doing and in a sense he got what he deserved in the end carrie on the other hand has been portrayed as this vixen who gladly used married men for her own gain and nothing could be farther from the truth she didn t even know hurstwood was married until drouet sprang that bit of trivia upon her after he was informed by a maid of carrie s frequent outings with hurstwood also drouet was not married but they did live together as an unmarried couple in a day when that was unthinkable ! to me carrie is the most identifiable character here not because she s the title character but because of her need to overcome a repetitive life full of drudgery routine and never making her ends meet this was summed up perfectly on page of this edition unless carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of hard work without longing for play how was her coming to the city to profit her sister and her husband carries attitude regarding work and her outlook on life is on the surface very frivolous and not at all of an adult carrie bent over her work she felt as though she could hardly endure such a life her idea of work had been so entirely different page she wanted more out of life than what the industrial s had to offer and anyone can identify with that sentiment especially today in the hyper st century what are supposed to be office jobs turn out to be something we practically live with and then you re fired or laid off without warning for reasons that wouldn t make sense to a preschooler and for our troubles we die of cancer in the end translation nothing much has changed in one hundred plus years in this country carrie had advantages like men wanting to take care of her that others don t have nor ever get but when the going got tough in new york city she put her feet to the pavement and found work something hurstwood was always putting off whether one feels carrie deserved her fame courtesy of hard work or through sheer luck of being at the right place at the right time ames s thought sums up the reason for her success the world is always struggling to express itself most people are not capable of voicing their feelings they depend upon others that is what genius is for one man expresses their desires for them in music another one in poetry another one in a play sometimes nature does it in a face it makes the face representative of all desire that s what has happened in your case page did the good guy gal win here that s up for debate one thing is for sure is that sister carrie is definitely not your conventional tale and is a fine representation of good american literature one final note it s worth checking out the scholarship at the beginning of barnes and noble classics editions as well as other editions that offer the same while i find the overall scholarship to be biased majority of the time it is nonetheless helpful and aids in your reading of the text donna di giacom 
i wish had six stars this books is off the charts ! ive been reading for a long time and this book just encompasses so much for the african american experience my favorite parts of each chapter are the anecdotes and sayings found at the end of each respectively purchase this book and pass it on other everyone you know who needs a laugh 
wonderful tool for learning top notch pastry skills i went to pastry school in france and found these books absolutely indispensable need to learn the classics of french pastry this book and the other three in the series is for you ! there are lots of detailed pictures and explanations are clear and well written along with time lines to help you gage how long a project will take the recipes are frequently given for large restaurant quantity along with a scaled down version suitable for home cooking my only complaint is that there s no index that spans the volumes though each book does have its own index with references in both english and french very useful master the information in these books and you can work in any pastry kitchen anywhere in the world creams confections and finished dessertspetits fours chocolate frozen desserts and sugar workdecorations borders and letters marzipan and modern dessert

a deficit of cartoons to accompany this awesome book this is one of the best of the best of the really ticked off conservative white guy s rage against things genre i ve ever read in a bookstore miller has had enough of his own party who have become a bunch of far left insane madmen intent on destroying america starting with the armed forces that cost gazillion a year and now it s time to rage miller just goes off on this that and the other thing pointing out how low our culture is how our values are in the toilet and how the conservatives are on the run from hillary clinton s army of replicants etc etc but the best part of the book is when he blasts insults at people at various lowlifes that occupy the media rappers political hacks etc etc i mean what s better than a guy going loco about a deficit of decency than a guy letting fly with various insults and indecent remarks to make his point about this deficit of decency see miller makes the point by being indecent and showing you that there is a deficit of decency in the usa conservatives on all sides have no power anymore so instead of doing anything about the appalling celebrities that run our nation or rappers who say bad things they write really bad books about how bad things are then we all join the republican party and the country gets even worse for of people at least we know that formula works ! here s to hoping miller and others like him return the usa to the days when we had a decency surplus 
many special effects adobe is striving mightily to make after effects the dominant tool for editing animated images much like photoshop is the pre eminent program for editing static images bolante shows here why ae has a far more challenging task even leaving aside competing tools ae must handle video editing and audio editing here it needs to synchronise two such tracks in such ways as the ending of one triggering the start of another the audio editing is somewhat rudimentary other programs that specialise in this have more sophisticated options but unsurprisingly the video editing forms the major part of ae several chapters are devoted to it many video special effects come right out of the box like texturing surfaces or applying a gradient wipe of course many films will need text to be shown in the video as expected you get a panoply of font families to choose from along with effects like showing text along a contour that you define quite familiar to photoshop users but now redone in a broader context to be sure this is not a simple book the complexity of film editing necessitates this but you should find that most tasks described here are straightforward to do though realistically if you re trying a technique for the first time many iterations may be needed before you re satisfied 
great overall book i thought this book was amazing while the writing for some might be difficult at first the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination the morals of lord henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow but i guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader s head this is definitely the most influencial book i have read 
excellent i have to come to the defense of martha grimes on this book in view of the many detractors having read all of her richard jury mysteries i was glad to see a new one after what seemed like a long time jury is of course up to his usual dark gloomy melancholy ruminations but that is to be expected it is for the excellent plots and characterization of others in the story that keeps me coming back and in this book grimes has not let me down tho a little short on the long pid menagerie s appearance plant excepted her portrayal of the adult interactions with children is superb ! loved every line of it and as a grandpa i can attest to it s accuracy and entertainment value though dark in subject matter the outcome was especially satisfying and jury s actions and detecting were again suberb contrary to some of grime s jury novels this one left me feeling satisfied at the en 
compelling and disturbing by turns despite the book s setting in the middle east and the death of the victim by a terrorist bombing the author has kept politics out of the story in a sense this adds to the sense of horror because all the reader is left with is how the characters struggle to find ways to overcome red tape to find a final resting place for a humble cleaning woman a foreigner who wasn t even jewish characterizations are first rate and the succinct structure and brevity make palatable what might otherwise be an ordeal yehoshua is already winner of numerous awards in his own country and it wouldn t surprise me if he is nominated for a nobel someday 
i shouldbuticantputitdownbook what a fascinating book perhaps autistic people have it more often than not right they deserve more credit furthermore what a great detective i didn t quite feel the unraveling of the mystery in this book coming as it did christopher the main character in this book would say this book is great for anyone who likes to get a better understanding of other people especially autistic ones who likes a good old fashioned detective book

highly recommended visit any healthy manufacturing operation and you ll see a buzz of bewildering activity parts being moved on overhead cranes raw materials being wheeled in line operators checking their production schedules before they change the line over to their next product those production schedules as this book suggests can really be a hindrance operators become dependent on them although the schedules may not accurately reflect customer demand the solution kanban which is based on having a communication system right on the factory floor that communicates key indications of customer behavior buying ordering canceling directly to the workers themselves production activity therefore is actually scheduled based on customer demand rather than on past expectations with the advantage that you hold less inventory and operate more effectively this book which comes with a compact disc of implementation directions gives clear insight into this powerful scheduling system employed efficiently by toyota and other world class companies we highly recommend it to executives managers and supervisors of companies that earn their living by making widgets more successfully 
nobility and love steve ilg is as noble as they come and his work is a work of love i have read many other books in the fitness category and none compare to the path of wholistic fitness and it is so much more than just fitness if you want a program that teaches you about yourself and expands your perceived boundaries about what is possible as a human being tbt is the place to be if you want to reach all the podiums of life look no further namaste w 
a must read for logically challenged liberals unfortunately the public school system of america has eradicated all courses relative to developing a student s ability to reason and reason well rhetoric and the socratic method were essential parts of a collegiate student s curriculum in medieval europe and the universities of america would not be remiss in re introducing this dynamic type of verbal intercourse today 
spooktacular some time ago i read one of this author s other books and it was undoubtedly one of if not the best book of this type that i had ever read i was therefore understandably excited when i found this book and began to read because i expected another masterpiece of the ghostly kind what i found however was something quite good but just not up to the standards that i had set for this author i must admit that i may be being a little unfair here because if i had come across a book this good by almost any other author i would have been impressed but from jeff belanger i just expected a little more this grand master of the ghost hunter world has just set the bar so high in his previous works that it s going to be almost impossible for him to reach the same level of perfection with every new book i guess that i m just going to have to accept that fact whether i want to or not over the years i have come to the conclusion that eyewitness accounts are indispensable to this type of book and that without them all you really end up with is a bunch of old legends belanger has a history of excellence in this area and this book is no exception if anything he takes eyewitness accounts a little to the extreme in this case the stories in this book are made up exclusively of interviews with eyewitnesses and these first person accounts are generally excellent one pitfall of this style is evident in this book however and that pitfall is that some of the interviews will obviously be better than others in other words some people are just naturally more articulate than others while others are very articulate in person but their words seem to become less clear on paper overall though the interviews were excellent and were conducted in a very professional manner the biggest problem that i had with this book however was that the author relied far too much on the eyewitnesses for the possible history behind the haunts in some cases this worked just fine and the subjects were intimately familiar with the background of the ghosts in question in other cases though there was little or no history to be found and it is sometimes hard to really get a feeling for a haunt without knowing what might have caused it a little research by the author would have added immeasurably to a few of the stories but once again i may be being picky because this author has shown himself to be a more than capable researcher and i found that i really missed his work in this area still this is one fine book of ghost stories and one that any ghost enthusiast will want to read and own the interview with george lutz alone is worth the price of the book and i must applaud jeff for having the courage to take on such a controversial subject also included is an interview with a nephew of ed and lorraine warren another controversial subject that is quite frankly marvelous this is without doubt a five star book so i just regret that i couldn t give the last book i read by this author six stars 
all the facts and more this slim little book taught me more about opals than rummaging around in the opal stores and book stores of sydney ever did fred and charlotte have managed to add lots of juicy information about opals how they are made history cutting what makes them special etc and present it in a very easy to read manner a great book to give anyone an indepth knowledge of opals 
great read dr mcgraw s book is great reading and i would recommend along with mr mark middleton s book personal success and the bottom line 
if you can t stand the heat i appreciate caroline s honesty in this work she does not attempt to placate anyone and is forthcoming with her beliefs it is a welcome relief to hear someone speak from an attitude of givegivegive rather than worn taketaketake of recent best sellers we are a self absorbed people who really do need to stop and reflect on how we can best help others on their journey on this planet and not just human others the animals and our planet itself is in dire need of our compassion kudos caroline it is nice to find someone with the courage to tell it like they believe it is and let the chips fall where they may

a must read for fundamental investors philip fisher s thoughts and experience are invaluable and timeless not as boring to read as the intelligent investors though both are equally important reading i particularly like the chapters about fifteen points to look in a common stocks when to buy when to sell five don t and developing your investment philosophies one particular topic that i like best is about dont follow the crowd also on how i go about finding a growth stock this book also covers what a good business should have it recaps of what they teach you in business school i have years of investing experience before i read this book i know i should have read this book earlier and in my opinion this book should work as a guideline to develop our own investing philosophies and not our philosophy itself there are no one size fits all strategy in the investing world this book will also help to open your eyes especially for beginner that investing the right way is not easy and is a complex process however the result from a patient and diligent investor could be great there are important aspects of a business apart from the stock price which this book will cover most of them the business and the industry the financials the people management personnel i also recommend you all to read ben graham s the intelligent investors with commentary by jason zweig who will give more recent and relevant example and peter lynch s one up on wall street once you read them all coupled with some real experience then you are ready to be an investing pro happy investing

this hits home for me as a ksu student yesterday i picked up this book at the kent state bookstore as i finished out the semester i had seen this one before and it looked good even though i haven t completely finished the book yet i can say already that it is something special gordon presents many facts interviews and testimonials that make you wonder if there really was a conspiracy at kent state i don t think it s false information that he s giving alot of it makes you wonder what happened at the beginning of the book however gordon bad mouths kent state for not commemorating the students that were killed yes they did dedicate a memorial to the quoteventquot of may th but since being published in the university has dedicated a number of memorials to the students including blocking off parking spaces where the students were shot all in all this is an excellent book 
a timeless classic i absolutely love kate seredy it was such a treat to check in with the adult kate and janci they complemented one another perfectly kate the delightfully irrepressible moppet who brought many smiles to many faces in quotthe good master quot does not fail to deliver in this book as well janci has grown into a thoughtful gentleman and the hungarian backdrop is a very effective way of describing eastern european culture this is an excellent book and i certainly hope you will read it it s great 
great for the office and beyond the practical concepts offered in this book simply make sense on a business level these real life action items provide great ideas to truly motivate my employees i have to believe that if company leaders would truly embrace these principles they would not only enjoy more passionate employees but they d also enjoy the bottom line impact on the personal side i also appreciate the hints that translate into being a better husband and dad 
a wonderful rendition of an enduring classic an audio recording of patrick stewart s one man rendition of charles dicken stimeless classic stewart has adapted the text for his show and performsall the characters and necessary sound effects it is wonderful example ofthe power of a good actor the enduring story of a christmas carol involves ebenezer scrooge a greedy grasping businessman who is untouched by human emotion or so we think until he is visited one christmas eve by four sprits who show him the error of his ways in the end a redeemed scrooge resolves to keep the christmas spirit all the days of his life and to be good to his fellow men stewart is able without the aid of costumes scenery special effects orother actors to bring this timeless tale to life his vivid characterization of each person is all the more remarkable for the fact that the only tools he has are his voice and the listener s imagination i enjoy his rendition more and more each passing year 
fantastically useful i read gowa s book for a graduate course and found it to be immensely helpful for contextualizing international relations debate she writes in a clear style and her insights are well articulated highly recommended research is also meticulous and precisely documented 
he s got experience and it shows despite it making it sound so easy to win in the market i liked the book in my opinion the book belongs to the list of better ones on investment advice instead of launching into predictions on how the market will behave or suggesting technology stocks for their fantastic futuristic stories lynch offers down to earth advice though perhaps with down to earth language as well he finds value in conventional businesses and he clearly explains why he asserts that amateurs can be as good or even better than investment professionals as long as they keep their eyes and ears open one needs to try things the products of the company whose stock you are interested in out oneself in order to understand the products values as with any other book on investment the author states things that are downright wrong why should short selling be described its more like borrowing with criminal intent but his exposition exudes a quality that can only come from having an abundance of experience i also appreciated his honesty having said this much what i really got out from the book one needs to classify stocks and set specific investment objectives for each of them prior to purchase and do not pluck the flowers and water the weeds to elaborate on the latter i have been selling winners prematurely and waiting for laggards to bounce back to my purchase price in order to avoid loss a common mistake most likely but something that would have been left under the blind spot unless i d seen it articulated 
a good read with some dissapointments early christian families in context is a very thorough academic exploration of family gender and sexual issues in mostly the greek roman world with some reference to old testament israel while some space is allotted to new testament sources this book falls short in not delivering the promise in the title by focusing more on the context which is great than on bringing new insight to the phenomenon of christian families within the particular context which is not so great 
another fun book only this time with my hero nancy drew love the idea for these books perry mason nancy drew can t wait for the next one love the research that gets sprinkled in to make a fun book who s next mike hammer philip marlowe 
for the love of the game my story in the book for the love of the game one thing that i learned about this book is that you should never give up and always keep on trying even if you are not good at something at first then you should not give up and keep on trying untill you get good at the thing and that you should not just stick with one thing but try other things you might be good at it and that things just do not come to you you have to work at it that is what i learned about the book 
a profound and important way to improve your life i had read dr ornish s books about diet and health and found them to be very helpful then i read this one this is by far the most important book that he has written because how we handle our relationships with others is more important to our health than even what we eat and how we exercise a little of this information was familiar to me from reading the new york times science section but most of it was not clearly the biggest disease of our modern culture is our estrangement from each other for most of history we lived with others in small intimate groups now that the population is much larger we live in large groups with no close relationships even our families are losing that intimacy this book puts the priorities back where they should be having close relationships with others comes first this book is a blessing to us all thank you dr ornish ! this book would be a great gift to everyone you care about on valentine s day 
quitling with carol armstrong lots of ideas beautiful color photos makes me want more of ms armstrong s books 
theoretical universal ai solomonoff s famous inference model solves the inductive learning problem in a universal and provably very powerful way many methods from statistics maximum likelihood maximum entropy minimum description length can be shown to be special cases of the model described by solomonoff however solomonoff induction has two significant shortcomings firstly it is not computable and secondly it only deals with passive environments although many problems can be formulated in terms of sequence prediction for example categorisation in ai in general an agent must be able to deal with an active environment where the agent s decisions affect the future state of the environment in essence the aixi model the main topic of this book is an extension of solomonoff induction to this much more general space of active environments although the model itself is very simple it is really just solomonoff s model with an expectimax tree added to examine the potential consequences of the agent s actions the resulting analysis is now more difficult than in the passive case while optimality can be show in certain senses the powerful convergence bounds that solomonoff induction has now appear to be difficult to establish like solomonoff induction aixi also suffers from computability problems in the one of the final sections a modified version of aixi is presented which is shown to be computable and optimal in some sense practically this algorithm would be much too slow but this is a clear step away from abstract models which can in theory be implemented for anybody interested in universal theories of artificial intelligence this book is a must the presentation is quite technical in places and thus the reader should have some understanding of theoretical computer science statistics and kolmogorov complexity 
sylvia i love her what can i say that everyone already knows she lifts your spirit even if some of you don t want to believe its ok i do and that is all that counts she is a wonderful writer and i love her

applying the tree of life i always was interested in the qabalah and the tree of life and studied it off and on for a long time but i never was able to use it for anything practical much less for my own life matters this book showed me just how really practical the tree is and how it can be used with profit i enjoyed it and use it in many matters each week although i sure don t live by it as gospel still i now have something useful and i understand the tree a lot better and appreciate it more one thing i just found out from a web search the author has a website th matrix press that has a calculator that will do all the hum drum math for you in seconds if i like it so much why am i giving it stars rather than i don t think anything in this life is perfect so that s why but check it out it will help you more than you think

maybe more pertinent now than when published when this book was first published about six years ago many reviewers on amazon com really ripped it up i d be curious to see their opinions now that their impressive retirement portfolios are worth next to nothing and they re looking for work that they can t find its a fine philosophy but it depends on who the reader is pollan isn t right about everything for example he claims that non cash gifts aren t subject to gift tax not exactly and his ideas about getting to know the manager of your bank branch personally are quaint at best in my experience bank branch managers last a few months at most i also don t understand his recommendation to lease instead of buy cars leases are generally designed to rip people off but that said the idea of not retiring of working so you can have a life is right on i suspect after the upheavals of the last few years more people are likely to agree with him and see validity in his ideas however like so many of these books it s essentially an interesting ten page essay expanded into a book if you think you re going to work at a job for years then spend a few years shuffling around the golf course waiting for death buy it and read it if that scenario strikes you as a dead end fantasy you re probably already with the program

leadership rules in a turbulent world a worthwhile book on survival through good leadership 
great book but not the end all be all this is a great source of information for the traveler it s the best large scope book i ve found for finding information on intracountry travel via bus train taxi etc it s also well written with a wry sense of humor some limitations however are timeliness as businesses are constantly opening and closing in china and i ve already found a few places mentioned in the book that are no longer operating prices have also almost all gone up despite the book coming out just a year ago gotta love inflation the rough guide to china offers some better historical information and general overview of areas but comes in short with getting around info i like the rough guide better for planning and the lonely planet more to help while actually travelling

one of the best in a popular mystery series this is one of my favorite anna pigeon novels she is a ranger in guadeloupe mountains national park and comes across the body of a ranger who has apparently been killed by a cougar hence the name of the book she is convinced that the lion has been wrongfully accused of murder and this conviction grows stronger as more dead bodies appear since an autopsy of the ranger shows that she was killed by the cougar you know from the start that barr has come up with an good setup for a murder mystery with a novel choice of weapon ranger anna pigeon is an interesting character with a backstory she is a widow who escapes new york by becoming a ranger a long distance relationship with her psychiatrist sister a plot device that serves well to reveal inner thoughts and a vice alcoholism she s cynical and worldly but that is balanced by her love of nature and the parks she s also a bit of a superhero especially at the end and i don t find those parts too convincing the book conveys a great sense of the setting barr loves the desert parks including the site of this novel guadeloupe mountains in west texas this is a relatively unknown park which includes the high point of texas ranger pigeon spends a lot of time in the backcountry of the park and makes it sound inviting even though there are no water sources there the book has a well constructed plot though the ending lacks a full resolution as is generally true in this series it s easier to make good guesses about whodunnit than it is to figure out the motive some motives are so oddball out of the box that i don t see how you could figure it out from the information given and that s a violation of the mystery writers code barr almost commits that sin here overall this is a good introduction to the series if you don t like this one don t read any of the others

i also want to churn some butter i know this book is packed with theory and is intended to give the readers some insight to the montessori style education theory nevertheless in spite of the aforementioned this is a great read and if some theory is delivered by the way then this is only an extra bonus elizabeth ann who spends her first years with her ever worried aunt frances is suddenly forced to move to the putney family she always feared of living on the farm this is a story of a personal growth covering all aspects of a child s life the growth is both mental and physical and is as enjoyable as the little house in the prairie books or other books of the kind i mention the little house books as for me that s the ultimate compliment for me the pleasure and enjoyment have to do with the portrayal of the homey life and surroundings a good example would be the description of the main room that at first seems ugly to betsy and then becomes the most wonderful room in the world and especially the account of food personally i feel this is the first thing that gives the homey feeling which foods are served the way the butter is churned and how betsy learns to sweeten the apple sauce this is what i love another major matter of enjoyment is the fast process of change in betsy s thoughts abilities and appearance to which the reader is a witness similar change happens in the secret garden where the fresh air outside coupled with hard work makes wonders my only problem comes when i did try to return to theory and to try and adopt some of it to my life with my children off course anyone i know wants this natural closer to nature life how are you going to achieve it in our modern urban life is a different question i know that the book talks more about the way and the process then about actually churning butter but i would like to churn a little myself there is no doubt that life in the outdoor with a lot of physical activity does wonders to your body and soul especially when small children are concerned 
encyclopedia prehistorica sharks and other sea monsters as always the pop up books by robert sabuda are amazing i loved it and my granddaughter was thrilled with it wonderfully well done

good account informative a little cheer leading in a mostly affectionate look at the origins and rise of the prime arabic channel the book manages to intersperse historical story telling behind thescenes accounts and political commentary intentionally or not the book provides an interesting case study in the differences in style philosophy structure of western channels like cnn fox and arabic channels though only al jazeera is discussed in detail as can be expected from the title certainly at least for a non arabic reader the book provides a wealth of information on tv media scenario in mid eastern region one could argue that the author is predisposed to some degree of cheerleading aljazeera but given the detailed research and discussion on the efforts of non quatar countries in the region the u s and u k to shut down or impede the operations of the channel it is clear that the channel has managed to become the enemy of everyone on almost all issues maybe as the author implies the channel is infact doing something right ! there is no doubt that a readers respect for cnn will decrease after reading the book and considering that until this book western media focused on villifying this channel the book is bound to temper those wrong notions maybe the channel will get its due respect one can easily be swayed by flag waving experts on talkshows some of whom have been semi exposed in this book this book is a fairly good other side of the story for those willing to listen persuasiveness of the author is diminished by what seems his blind cheerleading of the channel an excellent read providing accounts of the main gulf wars and from a different perspective devoid of sensationalism 
exactly what i needed to read this book really hit home i was so relieved to see someone else had struggled thru and survived nancy hagener s honesty is so refreshing thank you 
read between the notes the author seems very adept at bringing to light the fundamental essence of physics knowledge particularly the unresolved questions with his help i was able to pinpoint what appears to be a surviving trace of aristotle in physics particularly in wave theory for some time i ve sort of surmised that a wave is actually no more than a pattern or grouping of particles as such it is simply an object like any other object reading ridley s book it is clearly apparent to me that distinguishing between waves and objects has created a difficulty the soliton is an attempt to reconcile this difficulty differentiating it from waves and objects may simply be a persisting affinity for aristotelian categorization with some newtonian mechanics mixed in thankfully it is at least uncorrupted by probability theory opening the discussion of electomagnetic vs mechanical waves the author states but then horrible questions arise mechanical waves cannot travel through space devoid of matter they are a cooperative motion of atoms or molecules and their velocity is determined by the properties of the matter in which they travel so what materially is vibrating in empty space well this is rather interesting you know i mean can it be more clear that by creating a philosophical divide between waves and objects we are presented with such a problem by recognizing that waves are simply patterns of particles we escape from this problem since it is no mystery that objects traverse empty space if such even exists at least outside the place reserved for newton s actual accomplishments theres also the matter of the anomoly of diffraction of waves shroedinger which i believe is hereby resolved what s next in any case my hat s off to ridley he s amazing 
my all time favorite book though the book was written in but it seems it is written in s the notation proofs and typesetting are quite update the cross refrences are excellent the theorems are given in quite the genearlity way though not boring the proves are very exact for example mentioning where the axiom of choice is used etc this is a book i can not imagine how the writer started to write it it is very consistant ! 
sf criticism strikes again and hits a wonderful compilation of essays edited by james gunn and matthew candelaria some are out of print or hard to find canonical articles such as chapters from darko suvin s metamorphoses of science fiction other from robert scholes structural fabulation alexei and cory panshin s science fiction and the dimension of myth  or even david ketterer s the apocalyptic imagination  others are more recent or even written for the occasion as is the case of gary k wolfe s coming to terms  on the almost impossible task to define the genre it is a wide ranging and impartial collection it is very hard to find suvin and the panshins side by side on other compilations which is a must if you have a theoretical interest on this literary genre particularly teachers on any level but also recommended for everyone who just reads sf for pleasure and wants to know a little more on its history and significance will the scarecrow press and the editors be willing to have it on mass market paperback thus reaching a wider audience 
a great book for group work and intermediate witches i wouldn t recommend this book as a manual for absolute beginners that s what her other book the spiral dance was for however if you are somewhat well versed in the practice of the craft and are looking for ideas for group work this is a fabulous book written by a master of coven work truth or dare takes bold assertive steps in showing the reader how to form consciousness raising groups lead meditations and organize spiritual groups and is full of feminist poetry with a beautiful retelling of the descent of innana trance work stories of spiritual political activism and plenty of inspiration for your own work again to get the most out of this book it s best to be at least at the intermediate level and if you re looking to start a group but don t quite know how this is a great book to start with 
spooky entertaining good read i loved this book hard to read it alone at night especially if you are the only one in the house a great horror book ! classic 
the best so far in the series although a fan of nora roberts i had avoided these books due to a dislike for romance writer s sci fi however i have to admit to being pleasantly surprised should have trusted nora s writing ability this book is by far the best of the series that i ve read so far it is in the style of dame christie and if you love her work you ll enjoy this futuristic take on the genre one caveat nora or her publishers should really take the time to put in the front cover or on the back of the book a spoiler warning as this book gives away the ending to witness for the prosecution and murder on the orient express yes these stories are famous and a lot of people have read them but not everybody be coureous to those young readers who might read robb before christie and have two great stories spoiled 
the only golf book you will need i bought highly rated books on the swing from amazon and after reading the first i could not even hit the ball i had so much crap running through my head too many conflicting ideas and things to remember each book has validity but nothing was connecting the whole thing for me i just quit practicing that day and took a breather i took out the th book that night and slowly started into it i immediately connected with the material and incredible pictures in the book i carefully worked on the grip then my basic stance and posture over the ball next day i hit most of my practice balls well and everything feels good i am still working my way carefully through the other laws i want to really get one down before working too much on the next but i am confinced that this book is the only book anyone needs to improve at this game everthing this book teaches feels very natural practicing and really honing what i am learning in this book will take some time but this will be the only book i use from now on 
a book that s part tribute exploration and witty how many comedy writers have surrived so long with one performer the author started with lucille ball on the radio series my favorite husband she and her partner bob carroll jr wrote for the full year run of i love lucy jess oppenheimer who created the series left after the th season by the way this book makes a great companion to his book they also worked on the lucy desi comedy hour the lucy show and here s lucy in between they wrote the story for her feature film yours mine and ours plus various specials sadly the final series life with lucy is best forgotten the author does a good job of dealing with various stories regarding i love lucy and its main star you won t read about the problems that broke up the ball arnaz marriage here ditto for the strife between vivian vance and william frawley there s also no mention of the scare regarding lucy s onetime registration with the communist party ms davis may have wished to protect the now deceased stars or she wasn t directed involved in such matters this book provides a wonderful behind the scenes look at lucy s various series ms davis tried out many of the stunts beforehand would a woman be capable of them while her partner is listed as a co writer this is essentially her story we learn about the struggles she had as a woman comedy writer there s material on her personal life too the author writes with great affection for both lucy and desi she notes that his contributions were often overlooked ms davis and mr carroll later became producers on alice i caught one goof in the book earl hamner did create the waltons but he wasn t involved in little house on the prairie still this is a very good read please check it out

winterdance an unbelievable adventure this is the funniest and most enjoyable non fiction book that i have ever read i recommend it highly 
it doesn t get any better i have read every one of coulter s books and more romance than i could ever care to count and this ranks up there as one of my all time favorites of any romance and most fiction books north fascinated me from the time that he was introduced in wyndham i waited impatiently for his story and i was not disappointed he is the epitome of the brooding tortured romantic hero much in the spirit of rochester and heathcliff but without the violent gothic tendencies his brooding is partly by choice partly hereditary and he does his best to turn it into something silly so that the melancholy does not consume him the way it did his father and grandfather caroline is a heroine who though sometimes a little goofy is determined and strong and will do whatever it takes to get what she wants in this case she wants north and who can blame her the secondary characters are typical of coulter s creations in that they are wonderfully fun and witty some of the great moments o f the book occur during the interactions between north s misogynistic household and caroline s pregnant charges the story is basically about a man struggling desperately not to become like those who came before him a plot that is by no means uncommon but in coulter s capable hands the characters jump out and take on a life of their own making this story and specifically its hero insurpassable if only we all had a man like north in our life the world would definitely be a happier place for me

best book on ayurveda i ve ever read i picked up essential ayurveda on a whim at a natural foods store when i was really looking for something else what attracted me was the simple recipes and the pleasant conversational voice of the author when i began reading it at home i was so glad i had trusted my instincts ! i have been interested in ayurvedic diet for many years but felt it was complicated and hard to prepare but this author shows how simple it can be and very clearly illustrates how the loving respectful harmonic way of living with and caring for yourself flows through all of life not just diet a wonderful book i think it s the last book i ll ever need in order to understand ayurveda better i also already have heavens banquet which the author recommends as a great source for balanced and healing recipes now i ll go back to that book with new eyes

if you love golf this is for you i have read many of the books in the chicken soup series but this one really hits home ! i am a golfer and everyone who plays the game will tell you that golf is a metaphor for life these short essays really capture the essence of the game i suggest that everybody start with the essay entitled quota wing grew back quot written by jay gearan it is skillfully crafted and immediately draws the reader into the inspiring story of the challenges confronting a handicapped golfer i certainly hope there will be a second helping of chicken soup for the golfer s soul and hope to see more work done by gearan kudos for a job well done

does what it promises i highly recommend this book im on week of the learn to run k walk run program and i couldn t be more pleased with the results before this book i d never run willingly or even remotely saw myself running in a race in gym class i was always the last to finish the mile run because i had to walk of it now with the help of this book i m scheduled to run a k at the end of week and i definitely feel like i ll be ready to my great surprise i ve actually become a real runner ! i can hardly believe it this program is great because it starts you off very slowly leaving you always feeling like you could do more you feel encouraged because you re not wheezing and gasping for breath at the end of each workout and you look forward to the next one because they are very do able the program ramps up at a couple spots which was daunting to think about before hand but which wasn t that bad once i was out there doing the workouts the key is to follow the program like it s a script don t deviate from it and by all means don t try to do more than is prescribed the program if followed religiously will have you running a k in weeks with no injuries things you will need two stopwatches or else an ipod music playlist that s pre timed to match the run walk intervals decent running shoes that s it now get out there and start on the road to the new you 
excellent photo reference another fine effort by bouchery in the world war ii genre this particular work focuses on the equipment clothing and personal items borne by british canadian and free french paratroopers for the normandy invasion period photographs as well as staged images with period gear and clothing give the world war ii military buff a great guide now i would like to have a similar work for the market garden operations that include the polish paratroopers 
lifesaver i admit at first i could feel my eyeballs melting from the pedantic aura that radiated from the economy of nature the text followed a simple formulaic method of teaching each chapter began with a generalization usually relating chapter concepts to a current issue before dissecting the topic from the easiest to most difficult concepts the material was essentially mathematical based on the graphs and equations normally associated with ecology and the section on population growth is particularly helpful if you re a bit rocky with incorporating all the rates to calculate the net growth it was boring boring boring but it was concise and saved my arse on final exams if you re taking intro bio i would recommend this as supplementary reading it s definitely not as wordy as the average bio textbook but you ll learn loads more about ecology and the math involved isn t tricky the formulas are explained well so even if you find it challenging you ll get the hang of it in no time 
hard sf is not entirely dead if like me you lament the state of science fiction today and if like me you long to read stories that will transport you back to the days of the masters of hard science fiction writers like arthur c clarke robert a heinlein hal clement and malcolm jameson then this thick volume could be just what you re looking for in general i find today s science fiction unreadable every once in a while out of desperation sheer boredom or an attack of unwarranted optimism i pick up a new release sf paperback or check one out from the library i am invariably disappointed some current sf books i can t even finish whereas i continue to read the old ones over and over i can t recall any memorable sf books written within the last years in my humble opinion there are very few recent books that even begin to compare to the hard sf classics like space cadet the deep range mission of gravity or bullard of the space patrol to name just a few the hard sf renaissance however gives me some hope that all is not lost if you re a fan of hard sf the stories in this book should appeal to you while i don t agree that they collectively presage a renaissance of the hard sf style they are nonetheless all quite good and live up to their billing i commend this volume to you if you want to read good hard sf without having to pull out an old dog eared brittle s classic from your collection

zillionaire s bumpy romantic road hit home to many years ago i took a close look at tom perkins as i covered his plenary discussion at the bio conference in san francisco as a newspaper reporter he was very charismatic and gracious and even a word well exhibited how sexy he really was at that time i didn t really calculate his age but was recently stunned to learn he is when i read the book review of this book in the new york times although he lives in a different material world from mine his novel describing the main character steven s struggle to find the right woman and the series of disappointments hit home i was surprised to read his line i am still looking for jessie in acknowledgments his acute observation towards jessie the executive producer of the reality tv was very informative to me about what a charismatic man like tom perkins would look for in a life partner bravo to his friendship dedicating his book to danielle steel an editor of the book and his amicably divorced ex wife 
the pen as complement to the brush ye mountains woods rocks and impetuous streamsye mantling heav ns speak speak for me ! arguably one of america s most important artists and the founder of the hudson river school of landscape painting thomas cole also had a literary side largely unknown his compositions with the pen encompass more than poems and a healthy smattering of prose a few were published but most were left behind in a rough assemblage of his journals and notebooks in as part of a doctoral dissertation marshall tymn compiled and edited these to produce this tidy volume of poems as with his prolific paintings cole s poems reflect an awe of nature a romantic through and through cole waxes lyrically about the rugged beauty of mountains lakes and valleys of a newly found rural america tymn points out thomas cole s love for mountains they fill his large ornate canvases dwarfing any small human figures that may appear a devotee of the catskill and adirondack regions of upstate new york cole embraced the outdoors with religious ferver he praises it unabashedly the hudson lies below a mirror d heaven and no tis niagara shouts from the abyss and before thee lies the holy lake outspread lake george and hail monarch of a thousand giant hills mt washington tymn in his introduction points out that cole s poetry is not the burnished work of wordsworth or other romantic poets cole never intended as much and many of the pieces do read more like inspired entries in a diary than higher style verse and where cole left his works unpolished in journal form tymn has resurrected the rough stuff footnoted with explanatory notes and excellent documentation the poems are presented in chronological order towards the end more verses are penned as letters to friends or to mark the occasion of a death the collection also includes four black and white photographs of cole s work among them landscape scene for the the last of the mohicans and the clove catskills both painted in at the height of cole s fascination with the romantic landscape coles allegorical lines about the bold american landscape are an interesting complement to his paintings anyone with an interest in the hudson river school will appreciate this volume

great but i love mcewan s writing enough to forgive him for the few faults this novel almost conceals at its best the prose evokes fitzgerald s effortless beauty at worst it feels showy or show offy pages to describe a squash match no need we get it ian knows squash ian knows fine wine and food ian knows neurosurgery ian knows blues the problem is that the novel hangs too long or too deeply on each of these subjects ok so the book is only about one day in this guy s life one hours of his hyper consciousness and as a result it has to go deep still i felt at times like mcewan was showing off not just showing 
rewiring the brain i found this book fascinating when i was a young mother i knew it was important to relate to my child in a helpful healing way i read many books on childhood development and none gave me the information that this book does in the early chapters the book explains the mechanics of brain development and the importance of the bonding relationship between mother and child watching a close friend of mine with her infant son has given me the opportunity to be an educated observor of this thirty years too late for my own child the second half of the book takes the reader through a case study of a woman whose upbringing did not provide any opportunity for healthy development and whose subsequent life reflected this through the parenting process of therapy the counselor actually restructured her brain helping to close the pathways that caused pain and pathology in her life this book would be helpful for therapist s needing to understand more fully the transformative nature that therapy can provide also i think young mothers could also benefit by understanding the choices that mothers make and the consequences in raising their children 
great primer for understanding the mid east israel slightly depressing but a great overview of why the arabs palestinians and israelis act toward each other the way they do 
as a man thinketh changed my entire life discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you as a man thinketh by james allen encompasses the idea that all that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts james allen eloquently explains how our thoughts create our reality and that in a justly ordered universe where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction individual responsibility must be absolute a man s weakness and strength purity and impurity are his own and not another man s before reading the book i was unsure to what extent our thoughts played in the creation of our experience i have always believed we can do whatever we put our minds to though i was unsure of what extent we could exercise control in the creation of our experience and by what means does one actively create after reading this book i felt my questions were answered and life suddenly took on a whole new perspective i felt as though i had uncovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life slotting into place a new perspective that not only helped uncover and concretize a new understanding of life but also shone light across the rest of the picture a world of possibilities became apparent with the realization that through an effort in right thinking and observation of circumstance i could begin to experiment to see just what exactly i can create this same observation would bring clarity to how my negative thinking affects reality and what role it has in my learning and progress circumstance does not make the man it reveals him to himself as each day passes the message this book puts forward becomes ever increasingly apparent good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results mentally reviewing past experiences i can see and understand the correlation between thoughts i had chosen to entertain and my circumstances looking at my present situation i can see how my thoughts are synchronous with the reality i see before me at an ever increasing pace i am now seeing how quickly my thoughts change and effect my present my future and my past the more i practice looking at life as a reflection and part of myself the more it seems like a game where we have to remain aware and look for clues as to how to best attune ourselves to the thoughts that will allow us to interact with our situation in the most harmonious way until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment with the majority the bark of thought is allowed to drift upon the ocean of life aimlessness is a vice and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction reading this book helped me to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that we can all take responsibility for every occurrence in our lives through the acceptance of responsibility we can use our current experience to design a way forward which best serves everybody if there is nobody else to blame except ourselves then we should be thankful to all those involved in revealing what we ourselves have created can you relate the ideas or concepts in this book to your personal circumstances in life such as your relationships your beliefs your goals your values etc explain since reading as a man thinketh one of my goals now is to help as many of the people around me as i can to think about and use the ideas put forth in the book to construct their own viewpoint from which they can then draw conclusions embracing the gift of responsibility for a power which grants us control over our circumstances would change the fundamentals of society i believe this would push us all in a more positive direction i can vividly imagine a world where people were encouraged to think outside the construct of the societal framework frames which less binds us together as it does section us off from the world outside of the box if our circumstances our brought about by our thinking then it would equate that global circumstances are a reflection of our collective global thinking if we were to fundamentally change the way we think about reality and even learn to positively influence reality then the world will outwardly reflect this change in thinking my goal in life is to attune my thoughts to ones that will help turn the vision i see of a world that works for everybody into a reality reading as a man thinketh helped move me to one of the most exciting standpoints yet which is that there is no such thing as chance looking from one angle it would not appear to me that everything is predestined i do however think we co create every situation in our lives through our thinking our thoughts assist in the creation of our reality and when we don t pay attention to our thoughts and feelings then the situations our subconscious mind creates might seem random and we may use the chance concept as a valid excuse and reason for not taking responsibility for the unwanted experience realizing i have no excuses for anything has been a huge turning point in my life the idea to me makes life in my mind fair at least for the experiences i can vouch for when i read the book much of what was said was immediately apparent and i had already come to a similar conclusion about some of my past experiences about three years ago just before i left england i fell out with my best friend huw who i had been friends with for ten years one weekend in the summer of after i had just come back from a holiday with huw and some of our other friends in the evening a group of us came together to meet and some rather unexpected events took place the crux of the story is that huw decided to take somebody else s word over mine with regards to a then recent situation the information huw had chosen to believe suddenly left our friendship of ten years in a less than an existent state of being at first the situation seemed like a chance happening and i was perplexed by how such a situation could have come about having arisen from decisions based on what i knew to be a fabrication i felt powerless suddenly and life seemed arbitrary i really didn t understand how such a situation could have come about could it be that sometimes life was unfair for days i was caught up in a circular mess of thoughts searching for the cause of the situation i started with thinking that the person who had lied to huw was to blame and that huw had had issues anyway i came to various conclusions however they all included the idea that sometimes things happen that we have no control over this stirred more confusion in me as it was something i did not wish to believe after really stepping out of the picture leaving the country for cambodia which for me really put a new and helpful perspective on life and then thinking about my relationship with huw retrospectively i came to see that just as circumstance does not make the man it reveals him to himself life was revealing to me what unfortunate circumstances could come about as the result of a build up and accumulation of unaddressed problems throughout our relationship i asked myself how a friend of ten years would believe this person over me and with this in mind the actual truth of the situation is in my opinion irrelevant if i had been a good enough friend to huw then trust would have gone without question i had lost the trust and faith of a friend the deterioration of my relationship with huw had gotten out of control and manifested a situation where i was forced to pay attention the situation had happened in such a way that it forced me to pay attention to what was important it wasn t anything to do with one situation i had created my own fate way before that from all the things over the years which had built up and built up and probably already given me countless clues i should have paid attention to until finally it was right in my face and i had to pay attention a man does not come to the alms house or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires nor does a pure minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power circumstance does not make the man it reveals him to himself no such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations and man therefore as the lord and master of thought is the maker of himself and the shaper of and author of environment even at birth the soul comes of its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself which are the reflections of its own purity and impurity its strength and weakness what are the most important new ideas or concepts you learned from this book please explain one of the most important new ideas this book helped me grasp was the idea that there is no such thing as chance and that we are solely responsible for our personal circumstances after reading as a man thinketh it felt strongly apparent that this world of ours works in just the way it s supposed to indeed quite perfectly and it would seem to me that it is us who are playing the game of life some how unaware of the rules james allen has given a wonderful example and explanation of how life works in perfectly fair way if there is no chance and our situation is brought about by our thoughts then how does that relate to a situation in life such as being diagnosed with cancer my understanding follows that smoking does not directly cause cancer it creates the ideal environment where a cancer could grow it is my feeling that our thoughts and actions are intrinsically related and our mind body and spirit are intrinsically connected and reflect one another i believe we all have what i can at best describe as a magical force inside us ever seen starwars i feel the outcome of our life depends on whether we control the force or whether it controls us where does cancer come from i think we create it i think through our thoughts and actions and choice of lifestyle and things we choose to expose ourselves to and through our neglect of certain areas of our life that we cause such a thing as cancer and indeed everything else to manifest we all have the power to create some really powerful things whether it is consciously and for the greater good or unconsciously and perhaps for the worse i think this also works on a global level reflecting our world wide collective consciousness i think every single one of us is responsible for the state of the world all the conflicts of the world or the cancers of the world so to speak take for example the conflict in iraq or the israeli situation the problems in south asia i believe it s all a reflection of our collective state of mind and the conflicts that go on inside of us we are in control you me everybody and we all have blood on our hands paul sartre once said that all human anguish comes from our individual responsibility for what each of us do and become there is no fixed human nature no predestination no god that determines our course and we suffer because we cannot handle this burden the power to think feel express believe will do and progress is from the start all within our hands this is an extremely dangerous distribution of power and on some level we all know it as a result most of us sacrifice our liberties to tradition and majority in an effort to off load that responsibility and we do it because we have a lot invested in our communal uniformity life in orthodoxy is comfortable familiar and requires nothing of us to perpetuate it other than our silent complacency we sell our freedom for some semblance of safety and the diaphanous concept of an establishment the world around us is an extension of the world inside of us when we do wrong we are only doing it to ourselves i think our whole world has got cancer and it could even look as thought it s dying although i hope its getting better if you look at satellite shots of the world and look at our major cities and the pollution cloud that engulfs them our poor world even looks like it has cancers growing on it thinking about thinking and the thoughts we choose to entertain is something we all need to do carefully ever since reading as a man thinketh i ve been realizing more and more how our thoughts create our reality i think as a man thinketh should be compulsory reading for the whole human race the more i think about it the more it makes sense has this book challenged or changed your thinking in any way if so explain how this book has entirely changed my thinking and now i look at life from a totally different standpoint one where i can see how i am in complete control of my circumstances now when i look at seemingly problematic situations i ask myself why and how i have created the situation and i ask what can be learned from the situation reading this book has helped me to see that when planned situations do not come together as intended i think we should remember that the perfect thing has happened at the perfect time to teach us exactly what we need to know for the greater good of everybody why was the outcome the most ideal thing that could have happened if we create our circumstances then we obviously create them for a reason and by looking for that reason we can see how our circumstances serve to benefit us no matter what they are i now realize how important it is to be selective with the thoughts i allow myself to entertain oftentimes i am quite unsure of where the thoughts in my head come from but now when i find myself thinking something less than constructive i stop and reword my inner dialog to shape a more positive feeling he who cherishes a beautiful vision a lofty ideal in his heart will one day realize it 
believe in your art ability this is a fantastic book on believing in your ability to be an artist it also teaches you to do art on a daily basis to stretch and grow in the varied mediums i have kept journals for years but never art journals i was amazed at all of the fantastic work that can come from drawing on a daily basis i even started drawing with pen rather than pencil to allow the mistakes to be there and not be afraid of them i would recommend this to anyone who doesn t believe they have any talent in art and for those who do and have been told over and over again that they just aren t quite right for todays art market get out there and draw ! 
warm and wonderful this book brought tears to my eyes the first time i read it it is warm and comforting a wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what 
forget pluralism says mills america is ruled by elites c wright mills landmark book from posits that the major decisions in america are made by a unified power elite rather a multiplicity of competing groups or citizens the power elite are the top leaders of the major economic political and military organizations the president cabinet senators top lawyers ceos business moguls bankers financiers admirals and so on they tend to share a common outlook privileged upbringing and similar values they also tend to be conservative practical men with good judgment rather than men of ideas these leaders move move easily between society s top command posts as economics politics and the militiary become more interdependent for example charles wilson president of general motors famously said whats good for the country is good for general motors and vice versa he eventually became the secretary of the department of defense it s this kind of mobility along with the shared outlook of leaders in top posts that creates a single minded military industrialpolitical complex not some kind of intentional conspiracy the masses in mills view have little power and influence over decision making they are passive spectators who take little independent action to directly influence policies beyond voting occasionally furthermore the elites can influence and manipulate the masses through public relations propaganda and irrational appeals via the mass media overall this book was clearly argued and well written then as now its thesis chafes against the spirit of egalitarianism pluralism and democracy in america also some might go on to argue that since this book was published in things have changed consider the civil rights movement or era both of which weren t initiated by the elites yet parts of mill s analysis have stood the test of time presidents and senators still tend to be much richer than the average american corporate ceos and generals move into and out of government consider dick cheney colin powel citizens workers don t get to vote directly on whether to invade a country or to close a factory mills book is certainly a famous one that every sociologist armchair or otherwise should read so if you re interested in the structure of power in america this book should be on your reading list

foreshadowing tess the woodlanders is said to be one of hardy s more descriptive novels and hardy is also said to have a love for this part of the country i thought this was a beautiful passage from the other window all she could see were more trees jacketed with lichen and stockinged with moss at their roots were stemless yellow fungi like lemons and apricots and tall fungi with more stem than stool next were more trees close together wrestling for existence their branches disfigured with wounds resulting from their mutual rubbings and blows it was the struggle between these neighbors that she had heard in the night beneath them were the rotting stumps of those of the group that had been vanquished long ago rising from their mossy setting like decayed teeth from green gums farther on were other tufts of moss in islands divided by the shed leaves variety upon variety dark green and pale green moss like little fir trees like plush like malachite stars like nothing on earth except moss and this description of winterborne as a wood god really stood out for me he rose upon her memory as the fruit god and the wood god in alternation sometimes leafy and smeared with green lichen as she had seen him among the sappy boughs of the plantations sometimes cider stained and with apple pips in the hair of his arms as she had met him on his return from cider making in white hart vale with his vats and presses beside him it is said that winterborne was a creation derived from hardy s own father the book also has the typical hardy realism and tragedy based on innocence and wrong choices the unfair position of women mere chance or should i say chance in keeping with the way hardy uses it for me somehow the more descriptive nature of the book while not that descriptive hardy is a realist not a romantic gave the book a hazy almost somnolent quality that almost distracted from the clarity and meaning of the book maybe it was hardy s intention to have the woods form a kind of shadowy hold over the characters the readers theres the strange effect a single tree had on winterborne s father and another on grace but hardy s description of the moors in return of the native had more power for me also the characters seemed undeveloped to me especially grace who was a main character marty seemed more real though maybe that was intentional as the book ends with her and poor grace floated un fixedly in the non place between two classes i love hardy s novels and poetry otherwise i may have given it stars i just read it it may be i need to ruminate on it for awhile 
good but slowly being replaced by online resources this a good book don t get me wrong however having been edited back in and being as it is largely focused on the documents that you as a small business owner are likely to be in need of it now seems a bit outdated and old fashioned when you compare if with the ease with which you can get for free similar formats business plans marketing plans invoices etc online in office microsoftcom gt templates for instance it is a good reference of what to look for though which is why i give it stars

living out loud review i love this book it s filled with wonderful creative and inspiring ideas i bought one for both of my sisters too ! 
dense prose with great rewards for the persistent patrick o brian is not for everyone in fact i tried to read this book many years ago and gave up i went back to it after seeing the movie again i was frustrated because o brian does not make it easy for the reader he makes only occasional efforts to explain technical jargon and historical context the dialog true to the early th century royal navy is often curious and can be difficult to follow even generally his prose demands a high level of concentration i persevered despite these difficulties and finished all books it went much better after i stopped trying to read over passages i did not understand and simply kept going after a while things began sinking in and my admiration grew for his characterizations historical fidelity humor and inventiveness jack aubrey a good natured royal navy captain brilliant at sea and hapless on land stephen maturin a surgeon with a complicated sometimes tortured personality very much the naturalist and cunning intelligence agent these very different men with only the love of music in common enter into a deep lifelong friendship not long after finishing the novels i read dean king s a sea of words a lexicon and companion to the novels it gives a brief historical sketch of the napoleonic wars the royal navy and the state of medical knowledge at the time the lexicon provides definitions of many obscure words used in the novels all of that made it clear that however much i enjoyed the novels i missed a great deal of o brians nuance and subtlety so i reread them all only then did i really appreciate his very high level of literary artistry the adventure which pulled me along on the first read became secondary to the philosophical themes the aubry maturin interactions the sparkling dialog and the detail in describing the workings of the ship naval discipline and life in early th century england some advice to those who want to tackle these novels if you don t have any background in early th century europe you should at least read the first pages of a sea of words and keep it handy when you want to look up a word you also need a good world atlas the older the better as many place names have changed over the decades finally read the novels in consecutive order i hesitate to say that because the first two master and commander and post captain are among the most difficult to read there are some slow spots and as i say o brian for the first time can be discouraging but they set up everything that comes after and in comparison make the later novels when o brian really gets in the groove much easier to read and comprehend master and commander begins in port mahon minorca an island off the east coast of spain with a rather testy first meeting between our heros aubrey a royal navy lieutenant and maturin an irish catalan physician and amateur naturalist both of them poor and without a ship jack is promoted to master and commander a grade below captain and gets command of a small sloop of war brig named the sophie joined by stephen as the ship s surgeon the sophie cruises the coasts of spain and france for enemy merchant shipping after capturing many prizes the sophie eventually battles the much more powerful cacafuego a gun spanish xebec frigate aubrey s leadership skills are very much on display along with maturin s medical prowess especially for the times and philosophical bent we learn much about the royal navy rank promotion corruption discipline punishment interest prize money ships guns ship maintenance and routine disease tides storms wind sails battle strategy etc fascinating stuff for me

the essential emerson this edition contains many good pieces of writing by emerson emerson is a philosophical and poetic thinker this means his poetry is often philosophical and his philosophy as expressed in his essays often poetical he is in one sense the quintessential american philosopher whose message is an optimistic and life affirming one he too is american in calling for a kind of human self reliance and affirmation and here it must be remembered that the controversial american moved away from trinitarian christianity to be a unitarian whose sense of the divinity was both transcendental and immanent it is no accident that he is the great father figure who hails whitman s arrival on the scene for they both were capable of seeing in everyday life realities signs of the divine emerson is not however the simple optimist one misreading makes him but a person who knew deep personal tragedies and had a sense of difficulties of life he does however believe in human powers and greatness and he does speak primarily in terms of affirmation he stands in a way at the center of much of american and even european thought for it is difficult to think of either william james or neitzsche without emerson i cannot say that he has been a central figure in my life but i have from time to time through his writings felt illumination and beauty glad to the brink of fear 
a wonderful surprise greenmantle is a beautiful story a hidden story it is a story of love murder revenge loss past mysteries resolution friendship and the fantastic this is the first work of charles de lint s that i have read and i must say that he will be put on my list of must read author s after this wonderful book greenmantle is the tale of a mystery a being that exist in our world yet lives in a parallel version of that same world he is a stag a greenman pan a goat etc alice treasure and her mother frankie move to a very small country town out in the woods after winning the lottery ali discovers the sound of pipes playing in the woods and is changed by the sound mix this story with a mafia story and what you have is greenmantle i never thought that i would be a fan of any story about the mafia just never been in to that genre but de lint works the mafia into a work of fantasy and it really works ! what you get is a wonderful story with a strong human touch and beautiful well developed characters set in the real world yet a fantasy world at the same time de lint s writing style reminds me a lot of neil gaiman s common themes can be drawn between the two writers both are able to create a totally believable fantasy world within the modern world in which we live both focus on relationships between people and the power that is in those relationships both take ordinary people and make them into their own kind of heroes gaiman has a slight edge over de lint but that should not take anything away from de lint de lint knows how to write a page turner that doesn t just have a driving plot numerous plots at that but he knows how to write well he always chooses the right words and really makes this book an enjoyable and moving experience the cover art is wonderful and is done by david bergen nice stuff favorite line of the book ive been all the way there and back again just like bilbo 
awesome i am very pleased with the contents of the book my vietnam veteran friends alsowere happy to find out about this book 
i m good for about one of these every ten years i don t know how women can read books like this on a regular basis i was sobbing like old yeller had been shot for about half the book it may ve been routine for the fairer sex but for me it plumbed emotional depths and psychological pain i prefer to leave repressed that said it was more than just cathartic it was a hopeful warm and even funny look at the simple complex lives of a family and at just how quickly life can change without giving much away a teenage boy feels compelled by a guilty conscience to become a guardian father of some kids i won t say whose even though it occurs early in the book the novel then follows the boy as he very quickly becomes a man and a man so different from his peers that he quickly takes on almost alien qualities the day by day payoff of such tragic sacrifice is the overriding strength of the story and it is a payoff for the reader to watch not only his life but the lives of his friends and family unfold i never saw the movie made from the book i hope it did it justice because while it looks like about a million weepy romance novels it reads like a modern classic 
excellent for discussion this is a book that supplies more examples than just what it is when dealing with ethics there is so much here that occurs in important decisions either we or our friends and relatives encounter regularly that i recommend it to anyone who wants to have a dialogue with another person or a group of people it especially lends itself to group discussion as a teacher i borrowed from ethics for everyone to bring out something from each of my students in discussion including the quiet ones it s not necessarily that it s a textbook it was not written that way but it can be a text or just good reading for thinking and kicking it around with your friends 
any ved mehta book is wonderful this is not his best ved mehta is my favorite writer i ve bought nearly all his books even old ones out of print that i ve found through amazon ved mehta s endearing personality and superb writing style make an irresistable combination having said that i must also say that remembering mr shawn s new yorker is the mehta book i like least it is the latest volume in ved mehta s autobiography but it reveals too little about mr mehta and redundantly much about mr shawn it tells more about the new yorker than i really care to know although i have been a new yorker fan for years perhaps this book simply lacks the editorial guidance mr shawn gave to mehta s previous books on the other hand an unexpected gift i found in remembering mr shawn s new yorker is an explanation of the background behind other mehta books written while mehta was on the new yorker staff i do recommend that all mehta and new yorker fans read this book but don t set your expectations too high 
one of the most wonderful books ever this is one of the most wonderfull books ever writen no doubt the story of the bible is the point of departure for a beautiful analysis of humanity full of humour and grandeur the book is big and one has to read it carefully to enjoy it completely every sentence is a jewel every passage is full of simple life elements that wonder and links us to the past to a point were we conclude that being human is a universal experience independent of time and space this is all blended in with a carefull historical research a detailed reading of the bible and of the sacred texts a masterpiece at its fully extent that is curiously not that popular in the english language 
yay for wise women the world needs more wise women i want all of these women to live in my house with me and share all of their wisdom you don t find better crones than these ones 
worth spending a lot of time with i had this from the library and now i want a copy so i can go slowly through the meditative practices described i particularly liked the light meditations one of the book s best features is the focus on bringing back into everyday life what you have gained by stepping out of everyday life this is an important perspective often missing from contemplative works khan quotes freely and knowledgeably from hindu buddhist and christian ideas as well as giving a good introduction to his sufi tradition the only flaw i noted is that his grasp of physics even for metaphorical purposes is extremely poor but you can ignore that and just enjoy the spiritual wisdom

good grasp of rd world struggles of natural world written in the style of the screenplay peter matthiessen mixes poetry and realism it is easy to see although somewhat confusing as to who the speaker is enjoyable 
this book was very comforting in a time of extreme stress anyone who s ever moved can tell you that packing the boxes is only the tip of the iceberg i made a point of reading this book when my stress levels reached their peak and somehow it calmed me it seems every fear i had about relocating to another area was discussed in a rational and helpful manner the author had ideas on everything from helping your children adjust to their new school to how to involve yourself in your new community i found this book very helpful and would recommend this to everyone 
very creepy i enjoyed this book a lot and the stories were not all scare the crap out of you some of them were a bit more heartfelt drop by drop my favorite story in the book is about a young girl who is visited by a little ghost girl with a shocking message dancing with marjorie s ghost another spooky one that illustates the phrase think before you speak shadow brother yet another goosebumps giver that has the reader guessing what really happened the ghost a short story with a creepy twistfor love of him sad yet scary this story is about a boy who is misleaded by a tombstone and its owners october chill this is one of the more heartfelt stories that really makes you think what you would do if you have only a few months to live being dead heartfelt and comical this tale is abouta boy in the great depression who dies and rightens a few wrongs before passing over overall i was very satisfied with this book and recommend it to all ghost story lovers 
the best gibson probably the best gibson yet a must read for his fans and a good book for newcomers too a real thought provoking read ! 
there are reasons this is a classic i read this brilliant disturbing novel twenty five years ago when i was in high school and liked it very much i liked it even more this time lawrence captures the human experience with unparalleled fidelity and uncommon audacity that which was shocking when he wrote it today is simply piercing and perceptive and the book is gripping fascinating horrifying and finally sadly true the movie is one of the best adaptations of a novel i know of but still does not come close to the book itself very much worth reading at least once literature at its best and most compelling 
brilliant work though not really for the general reader a landmark in vaughan williams criticism the book handles questions both of intellectual milieu frogleys essay on english musical identity relates it to a wider movement and of vaughan williams s musical art the essay on vw s use of rhythm is outstanding thoroughly refuting the picture of him as some musical bumpkin but essays of this type require some familiarity with the nuts and bolts of music as well as the ability to read it the book well rewards the effort it requires this has become a favorite book one that i reread 
me talk pretty one day this is my first time reading sedaris i m about of the way through the book now and i have to say this guy is funny i was up reading this book late into the night curled up on the sofa beneath a lamp rocking back and forth biting my lip weeping tears of merriment trying to stifle my laughter so as not to wake the neighbors many of the essays are mildly amusing some leave you wearing an involuntary grin but when he catches you off guard with an unexpected turn of phrase the result is devastating hilarity and you are left with watery eyes aching sides and a bubble of snot on your nose or at least i was 
captain vimes goes into diplomacy once upon a time in the multiverse there was indeed a fifth elephant floating around aimlessly he could not help it but he crashed violently screaming and kicking into the discworld at the same time splitting continents and raising mountains an eternity later his remains are still buried deep in the planes of uberwalt the home of vampires werewolves and most importanly dwarves dwarves who are not only mining diamonds and gold but lately also elephant fat it is exactly that valuable asset that brings lord vetinari the patrician of ankh morpork to the conclusion that keeping good diplomatic relations with uberwalt is maybe not such a bad idea on the other side sending captain vimes on such a diplomatic mission might not belong to that same pool of bright ideas it is always a great joy to meet the old folks of the city watch again for another crazy voyage this time it is not different it all starts with sergeant colon s experiences with the discworld version of a speed camera but soon the complete city watch proves that silliness is their strongest weapon this time not many new characters are introduced but this only means that known characters such as the igors and that cute little doggie gaspode get more attention the attentive reader certainly will notice the undertone that links certain forces in uberwalt to a nazi regime indeed references to sub humans and other nazi slogans are generously spread throughout the story in this respect the fifth elephant is unique at least for the discworld series in the way that it portraits a strong political message against extreme nationalism in the end it is not only a funny but also an extremely smart book 
a must read for parents of daughters i absolutely loved this book i read it little by little over time and discovered that this book unlike so many others is the product of real research painstaking research so i don t know how anyone can think these authors are politically correct or what they talk about the sexualization of girls all right but so much more the invisibility of girls in so many sources of media the way girls are dissed their word in lyrics tv shows movies the way girls are getting overwhelmed constantly with messages that they should be stereotypically pink and pretty from a very early age anyone looking for a book on sexualization of girls will find plenty of stuff here but what s more important is that girls are being stereotyped in a whole bunch of ways that narrow their choices for the future not only by being sexualized and parents will learn that letting their girls grow up all girl or in that girly girl stereotype means they will soon be sexualized by the culture the two are connected you have to read the book to see why i don t think that the authors are against pink or girly things they just have a thoughtful response to it and plenty of suggestions and conversational material for parents 
first time jayne ann krentz all in all this was a good read i never suspected the killer 
reflections on a golden studio although a little dated originally written circa this is still one of the great inside stories about what goes on or more precisely did go on in the old hollywood written about the time that the old studio system finally collapsed it collects some great anecdotes for film buffs besides it is well written 
second in the series in this book father john o malley discovers a dead body beside the road his credibility takes a beating when the police return and the body is gone at this point father john makes it his mission to find the body and discover who has died when a commercial developer threatens to take over father o malleys mission and turn it into a recreation center he becomes distraught and is tempted to turn to alcohol which has been the bane of his existence for many years instead he teams up with arapaho attorney vicky holden and tries to solve the murder while helping vicky with her drug addicted daughter susan this book while not as compelling as the first book of the series quotthe eagle catcher quot is still a good read 
buddhist cultural studies fabulous this is not one of your usual run ofthemill watered down quacky american dharma books mishra does a brilliant job of examining buddhism in its contemporaneous historical and cultural context comparing and contrasting buddhist philosophy with foundational western philosophers from the pre socratics on inquiring into the contemporary practices of buddhism in america and elsewhere all the while making obvious his own subjectivity i wish there were more books like this out there very smart informative provocative and personal 
best book on libya in a decade the definitive analysis having just ordered vandewalle s book for my seminar and lecture course i can only wish this insightful account of qadhafi s revolution and its link to the sanusi kingdom s attempt to avoid creating a modern state had been available much earlier it is easily the most sophisticated analysis of the country ever written and the thoughtful application of a modified rational choice and institutional literature to the puzzle of a seeming absence of state building in libya is first rate and clearly demonstrates how political scientists political economists can integrate theoretical concepts and factual material in a provocative fashion in addition vandewalle writes extremely well in a fashion that makes the theoretical material accessible even for non specialists this book is a real tour deforce recommended to anyone interested in north africa and the middle east and the problem of state creation in the region 
a wonderful treat there is something for everyone in o carrolls writing if you read and enjoyed the mammy then don t wait another minute before reading the chisellers ocarrol writes another splendid narrative of the adventures of agnes browne and her children this book like the mammy will cause you to laugh and will almost bring you to tears at other times the only downside of this book is that it is over too quickly thank goodness there is still another one in the series to read 
character study the marines of autumn by james brady st martin s press new york on the very last page of this fiction book the author james brady declares that the main character thomas verity was modeled after brady s rifle company commander in the taebeck mountains of north korea that commander was captain john h chafee of rhode island later u s senator from rhode island and secretary of the navy it seems to me that this novel is a character study where the author james brady presents a portrait of the ideal marine infantry officer with both good parts and bad parts captain thomas verity is different if not unique as a marine officer because he was born and raised in china speaks chinese because he has seen combat eg guadalcanal and then because after the war he had gone to college as the korean war begins verity is teaching at georgetown university his ability to speak chinese was the main reason that captain verity was recalled to active duty as the marines needed someone to monitor chinese communist radio traffic in china just across the border from north korea probably the author has given this linguistic ability to his main character so that captain verity can be privy to the meetings of higher level officers who believe that the chinese army is coming this permits james brady to make comments about the u s high command s pig headiness about the ability of the chinese to invade korea to support their communistic allies it also allows brady to zap general douglas macarthur who repeatedly denied the presence of the chinese army at the borders of north korea or inside north korea proper it is apparent that james brady does not care for macarthur for as an example in chapter two page he has one person calling macarthur the mikado himself on a poignant note the main character captain verity had lost his wife now with the death of captain verity the young daughter kate will be an orphan she asks and who will take me now to france to see the bridges 
a good introduction to nanotech this book was a relatively quick read it covers most of the basics without burying the novice like myself in the wealth of details in some of the more advanced books on the subject nanosystems and engines of creation are two great books for more on nanotechnology by eric drexler take a look at 
frighteningly real bumpy transitions spoilers note there are spoilers in this review i can see where some other reviewers could find the story dani tells in family history unbelievable one questions the lack of diagnosis the rapid digression the daughter makes after returning home from camp and the unanswered question of why she accused her father of molestation to begin with the irony here is those are very real despite how preposterous they may seem and while the question evolving around why the daughter made such an accusation could be seen as frustrating i think you re missing the bigger picture the more important point children who are confused who are having a difficult time with making the transitions that occur during puberty and feel they aren t getting their needs met can and have been known to make such ridiculous accusations not because of the pain they are bringing to others but rather because they feel that s the only way they ll be able to be heard i found that dani did an excellent job of detailing the love affair the narrator had with her husband up to and prior to the deterioration of the entire family that it seemed perfectly clear why the daughter felt like she had to yell rape just to get everyone to see there was a fire burning yelling fire wasn t going to get the response she felt she needed but screaming rape did she just wasn t able to see what the consequences could be however i wasn t convinced this was worthy of a five star rating as a writer myself i appreciate flipping between past and present even the need to start off smack in the middle then back off and give a bit more of an explanation however i found myself thrust into an antagonizing situation with far too much mystery surrounding it that i wasn t able to get into dani s tale until much further into the book that i would have liked i found myself too irritated with the narrator for several chapters in and the whole premise for why kate the daughter was sent off explained far too late in the book i think those should have been laid out better to which i fault the editor more than i do the author all in all it was a great book i enjoyed it and look forward to reading more of dani s books 
getting the love you want a guide for couples awesome down to earth a must rea 
dare to disturb the universe some books you forget as soon as you set down not this one i never liked robert cormier when i was younger i thought he was bitter depressing and pointless much like another reviewer who gave this book a one star rating now that i am more mature i realize he may be bitter and depressing but he is definately not pointless i guess you can see this book as just a story about a kid who gets beat up for not selling chacolates you can also see animal farm as a cute little story about farm animals however you can also see the chocolate war as a compelling demonstration of human sadism and the tendancy toward collective violence and nationalism it all depends on how deeply you look 
a fabulous friendship i came across this gentle book while shopping for gifts for my daughter s th birthday this is a book about friendship and that is a very important subject to kindergarteners i felt the author approached the subject in a beautiful and touching way showing how friendship can endure through the many changes that life will bring i can t wait to read the book to my daughter i plan on buying more copies to give to my friends too 
better faster cheaper than almost any other theory book although this book is obviously not geared towards those undergoing heavy duty classical music training if you just want to learn what chord construction chord progression scales and a little of what jazz and rock styles are all about this is the book for you this is hands down the best theory book for the player who just wants to play an instrument well enough to jam with his her friends or to learn and play songs from a fake book even an accomplished musician who knows little about theory and yes those people do exist can benefit from reading this plainly written enjoyable and inexpensive little book 
i thought it was pretty good actually i rather enjoyed the book it didn t look as though patzia is so concerned with making a strong position as he is with expressing a summary and the different positions on the topics he covers the glossary looked helpful and i really appreciated the extensive end notes and annotated bibliographies included in them i thought there was a lot of good information here for someone wanting an introduction to the issues 
a must read for every project member although i have been working as a software engineer since i never dared to become a project manager before reading this book i could not figure out what a good management is all about many projects dohave a project manager but they do not have something which deserves to be called project management many engineers complain about their project management they know that it is bad but they don t know howto make it right unlike technical stuff which you can learn on the job it is not possible to learn softwareproject management on the job very often the most senior the most confident or the most arrogant employee is chosen to become the manager this approach very often fails and a lot of money is wasted just by chosing the wrong manager in the last few years i got tired by all the fuss about management there are so many people talking aboutproject management and that it is important to make it right all these people complain all the time but theyare not able to distinguish between good and bad project management i decided to buy this book because i wanted to know how to make it right since this book is written by anexperienced program manager from microsoft i assumed that it should contain all the wisdom which i have been longing for so long and this book didn t disappoint me the art of project management covers areas as diverse as schedules estimations specifications relationshipsand priorities you find answers for every aspect of a project the content concentrates on project management rather thanon the project manager but the most important point above all everything you do should result in a benefit for the customer this book is a good reading for everyone working in a project ordinary members like me learn how to help the manager to make the project succeed 
a mirror of history a well researched and well written book on the life of maximilien robespierre considering the limited amount of information available on the subject i found this book to be rather informative and not just another recycled version of an older book ruth scurr delves into the conflicted mind of robespierre and examines the french revolutionary s descent from man of the people to murderous tyrant an excellent look at one of history s most misunderstood yet fearful figures a fine example to anyone interested in understanding the value of using terror tactics in supplanting dictatorial rule 
excellent learning tool ferling does a good job in depicting the way of life for u s office oriented colonists citizens in the s the relationship adams and jefferson had was also well described i felt the author had some bias but the book is still a must read for parities interested in the early u smannerisms of politicians at that time and important personal party battles

the book for telecommunications this should be a mandatory book for anyone working in the telecommunications industry not only is it comprehensive but the explanations are direct easily understood and sometimes humorous anyone who uses oxymoron in an explanation gets my vote 
goldmine record album price guide this book was a big help in determining price for each record however when i took the records to a record store to sell them they were not worth as much as the book claimed it is probably because the book is based on collector prices and i have not looked into selling to a collector overall it s a great book especially if you don t know anything about records 
stars for the star general i loved this book i was sad when it was over not only does it give a wonderful biography of a great man but a walk through world history during the first half of this century enjoy it 
great for inspiring designers this book is great for young inspiring designers to use as a learning tool and reference book it shows how to make a grid system work and how to modify different styles of grids to a designers particular needs the book is less in content and more focusing on showing images of the grid at work this is a must have book and the price is well worth it 
nephilim unveiled i bought this book version at b n on the spot i was so impressed with it the author clarifies the biblical issue of the nephilim using the book of enoch as well as archeology without going into the icke reptilian thing nor does he borrow anything from sitchin and the annunaki which amazed me in itself he also clarifies what i had read in john keel s book mysterious beings esp chapter and chuck missler s book alien encounters the secret behind the ufo phenomenon i think they d agree with mr heron we don t need ets to explain anything about the ufo issue the origins of man issue nor the issue of strange things around the earth eg mothman fast reading riveting and worth the time and money 
one of the best oprah picks i haven t read many oprah picks but i am so glad i read this one it s a murder mysery intertwined with related events past and present as another reviewer said this book has marvelous pacing and i totally agree with that you get deeper and deeper into the story as it goes along and i could never second guess this book either ! all i can say is wow ! so glad i read it along with this one i also recommend any man 
the binding s breaking but this has nothing to do with the quality of the bookbinding but rather the quality of the book itself the new york times cook book was one of the first cookbooks i owned by now it has lost its bright purple cover the outside has a few spots from over zealous cooking aka the splat and sizzle method of cooking and the binding shows wear andtear i have the updated joy of cooking but it doesn t compare to this classic my book automatically opens to the picadillo recipe which is just one of many recipes in this book that opened the door for me to other cuisines from it i discovered new ways to cook pasta and learned that there was life beyond spaghetti with meat sauce classic american recipes are covered as well so that you can cook the foods that you grew up on the recipes are direct not convoluted you will not be spending hours in the kitchen on a single recipe it takes your family five minutes to consume to steal the title from another book it puts the joy back in cooking this is the first book i turn to when i m stumped for something to prepare for dinner and it seldom lets me down when i m looking for a gift for a young person setting up a new home this is one i consider 
a modern day classic i believe that duck and goose released earlier this year will one day enter the pantheon of classic children s picture books it strikes just the right balance between humor and a gentle lesson about sharing and working together duck and goose begin by squabbling over the soccer ball that they mistake for a large egg and end up dreamily making plans to raise their baby together when a little bluebird blithely points out the obvious duck and goose take their changed circumstances in stride duck and goose s conversations will bring a chuckle even to the most jaded parent and the illustrations are lovely highly recommended by this children s lit snob 
one of the best movie guides i don t think anyone could find a more economically price guide for movies with such good coverage of directors actors a synopsis of the storyline and star rating system i don t rent a movie without first checking out what leonard maltin has written about it highly recommend 
fantastic concise precise instructions only downside is that it s not out of date since was released however the writer is excellent in laying out simple instructions to pull off effective effects 
pure genius this is pure genius at work i bow my head in awe this is not recommended reading this is the kind of book you must read if you re into strategy cut down on porter kay drucker etc and read this instead ! after reading this you can re visit the old schools and see the world in a different light in short i am ecstatic you ll pry this book from my dead hands if you can get it away from me even then read it or you ll miss a very funny book if you don t laugh out load a number of times you lack all sense of humour as well as a very thought provoking book with a very important message which even manages to make strategy fun youll understand more after having read the book together with strategy safari by the same authors and johnson scholes books this should be enough to get anyone to understand and work with strategy this has to be one of this decades most important influential books so i ll recommend it warmly

underscores the complexity of the human mind oliver sacks an anthropologist on mars is a delightful and enlightening book that reveals the unparalleled complexity of the human brain sacks an accomplished neurologist and author presents seven case studies that highlight different neurological phenomena in his case studies sacks follows a newly colorblind painter a man who can create no new memories a surgeon with tourette s syndrome a blind man who regains his sight a painter obsessed with images from his childhood an autistic boy artist and a high functioning autistic professor sacks does not treat his case studies as dry medical oddities but rather discusses their neurological experiences within their broader human existence unlike other authors who know their patients only distantly sacks works intimately with his case studies and develops meaningful relationships that translate into a deeper more insightful understanding of his patients and their experiences while sacks is clearly a brilliant neurologist what makes this book so powerful is his ability to weave in medicine science history and philosophy into a coherent narrative every case study illuminates a series of important and thought provoking questions that challenge the everyday assumptions of perception reality intelligence and what it means to be human in the end the reader emerges with a better appreciation of the complexity of the human mind the book is very well documented with copious footnotes provided throughout the book occasionally sacks neglects to define some arcane medical terms so readers would do well to keep a dictionary close at hand overall the book is highly accessible to the general reader who will find it intriguing and intellectually rewarding 
readable introduction this study has many of the earmarks of a ph d dissertation muted claims and qualifiers allusions to the frankfort school periodic summaries but it s a lucid jargon free beginning of a conversation that s long overdue many great american texts literary as well as cinematic have been excluded from academic canons and college reading lists on the grounds that they don t belong in the ironic modernist tradition by showing that melodrama is modernity s child not its antithesis singer invites us to pay serious attention to texts whose only crime may be full disclosure of meaning and undeniable influencing of the witness

an elegy of a wonderful marriage john bayley cbe and dame iris murdoch were married for almost years their relationship was truly unique special and hard to replicate they trusted each other nurtured each other in literary criticism and writing their union was brought together during their time at oxford where they lived for the remainder of their years together john writes lovingly about iris even during her illness of alzheimers which deteriorates the brain matter iris relied on her mind to write analyze and plan elaborate novels which were multi storied and engaged the readers to think themselves she was also a philosopher college professor etc it s hard to imagine that iris was no grand beauty but she had both inner and outer beauties sadly her disease would rob them of so much more iris became more childlike and unable to care for herself while john became the primary caretaker john who was in the shadow was now in the forefront without much help it s hard watching the film without shedding a tear or reading this book without feeling something for somebody we never personally knew but by reading this book we do learn about this amazing couple we learn about their triumphs and failures how they were just happy to be together and go swimming if only happiness was that easy to find nowadays john was a wonderful husband i admire his truth candidness and revelations that their marriage was not always about sex and that iris didn t care for it in general they didn t have any children and neither seemed to mind that outcome of their marriage

one of my favorite webcomics ever since i found earthsong while wearily roaming the depths of the internet i ve been a fast fan while i generally prefer grittier fiction earthsong s highly enjoyable if straightforward dialouge and plot keep me engaged and the subtle and not so subtle references to various mythologies and other works of fantasy are well executed rather than tacked on as is sometimes the case in similar works while not quite at the level of some other comics like sarah ellerton s inverloch earthsong s art and formatting are still among the best of any active webcomic the facial expressions of her characters fantastically designed in their own right are especially well done although certain perspective shots do occsionally come off rather odd the printed collection itself is somewhat lacking in terms of extra features but lady yates can be forgiven considering the immense amount of dedication and effort she put into its publication completely redrawing every page and making vast improvements in terms of pacing and art quality over all volume one of earthsong is a must have for anyone interested in webcomics or simply a classic fantasy adventure

remarque nailed it early on there seems to be a plethora of both novels and non fiction books now about the ravages of war and its aftermath describing both the physical and emotional scars now that the world has gone through world war ii vietnam and scores of other wars however when remarque was writing there was very little literature of this sort he nailed it early on when the allies were still celebrating their triumphs after the war to end all wars and no one outside germany really cared what happened there in the west even today we have been conditioned to think of germany during the world wars as an army of emotionless automatons who blindly followed orders and suffered no moral apprehension this novel and others by remarque show this to be untrue the germans died cried loved lost and suffered both physically and emotionally as much as any soldier of any army this is the fitting sequel to all quiet on the western front paul baumer even gets a passing mention as the protagonists remember lost comrades and while it lacks the grit and guts of remarque s wartime novel it shows the sense of loss grief and hopelessness felt by many on both sides after the great war and other wars as well

in search of lost time george bowling s life is pretty mundane even by his own admission he has settled down into his middle age with his wife and two children his mortgage and his steady yet uninteresting job frustrated george looks back to the days of his childhood in a small town in rural england and asks where did it all go wrong he tries to recapture those times but can anyone really go home again this is a beautifully written funny and at times poignant story orwell depicts with great skill the dangers of middle age drift and of trying to escape from it by revisiting a past which only exists inside your head he takes a swipe at various irritating types many of them still around such as the respectable middle classes who believe they are living in the countryside and are protecting it when they are in fact doing neither it is interesting in that the feeling of decay of falling standards seems to afflict each generation in turn although bowling is careful not to idolise his past pointing to the many faults of the society he grew up in the novel does reveal that there is nothing new in nostalgia g rodger 
a year in the world this was a vicarious year of trips for me many of the places i ll never see but i know how they are thanks to frances have bought the book as gifts for several people who love travel as much as i do 
very personal readings i sometimes find poems in remarkable ways and these seem so personal as if the poet had written them for me such is the experience of other readers and this book is filled with these personal accounts the accompanying dvd of poems features an even greater view of the person reading their favorite poems several of the poems of loss are most touching and i thank those readers for sharing particularly olivia milwards selection of goethe s the holy longing and associated butterfly that came to her garden included are poems from everyone s favorite poets multiple picks of robert frost emily dickinson and shakespeare but also lesser known in united states poets from other counties such as amichai from israel evan jones from jamaica or youssef from iraq it is also striking the variety of occupations of those selecting the poems there are construction workers attorneys soldiers investment managers and even a poet stanley kunitz 
excellent this is an excellent book for those who like me are trying to understand what is shamanism with the eventual perspective of becoming shamanic practitioners the matter is tidily presented this book is clear ! it was written by a person who has clear ideas in his mind it delivers knowledge which doesn t mean it ll make a shaman out of the reader of course it explains the difference betweeen a psychotic a shaman and a shaman pratictioner it explains why people may want to journey in the non ordinary reality it is a book written for the reader the only criticism i have is that journeying is presented as easy as eating breakfast potential problems are totally down played

not quite as educational as advertised the dust jacket for this book which you can view here on amazon by clicking search inside this book advertises this translation has been made especially for american children who want to learn spanish they will find a complete vocabulary at the end of the book in addition some spanish phrases and expressions that may be unknown to the beginner are translated at the foot of each page strangely the book itself does not have those features while it is a charming book and my children will certainly enjoy it there is no vocabulary at the end of the book and there are no footnotes

show me some love or i ll strangle you i d never heard of j p donleavy or his novel the ginger man until i got it into my head to read all the novels on the modern library s top books list the ginger man is only ranked but it s one of my personal favorites the main character sebastian dangerfield is one of the most vile detestable characters you ll ever read he has little in the way of redeeming qualities he claims to be a law student but he fails to study or go to any classes instead he spends his time abusing his wife fighting the urge to smother his daughter and pawning what few possessions he has left when he runs out of his own things to pawn he steals whatever he can get his hands on any money he acquires is quickly spent at the pubs he stumbles around town in a drunken stupor seducing and abandoning women what he wants most in the world is for his rich father to die and leave him an inheritance he reminds me of a combination of ignatius j reilly from a confederacy of dunces and sickboy from trainspotting he s essentially a hilarious scoundrel even though he s a loathsome character dangerfield s drunken misadventures make for enjoyable highly amusing reading the kangaroo brawl toward the end of the book is one of the most comically absurd scenes i ve ever read the ginger man is a wickedly funny novel that deserves its reputation as a modern classic it also deserves to be ranked higher than 
shows a deep understanding of science fiction themes as a longtime science fiction fan i thought i was reasonably versed in the main themes of this field but moylan s critique is at a far deeper level than my usual comprehension of science fiction he writes at an analytic depth that shows a deep appreciation and awareness for you to get the most benefit from his book you should already have a background in traditional english literature as well as science fiction the utopias and dystopias he studies in the latter are correlated and contrasted to themes already present in the broader literature unfortunately i lack that traditional background and so much of his arguments were lost on me 
i would give it stars if i could caution spoilers ahead spoilers i mourn the end of this book i just finished reading the last page i layed down for a moment the book upon my chest holding onto the adventures and the love that was shared with me through fitz s eyes i got up and looked online at all the reviews just hoping to extend that feeling wow i have never been so moved by a book i cried alot the poem the fool wrote his beloved made me cry so much i kept having to stop because my eyes blurred so i missed him tremendously and i was almost angry with fitz for being happy and that is when it hit me unconditional love not bound in any way the fool would never stand for my being angry with fitz for his happiness as much as i was sad angry for fitz and heartbroken for the fool he was happy for his beloved and who am i to judge them 
an informative book about special forces mr couch has provided a look into the actions of the us navy seals in the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq for security reasons the missions are described in a very broad sense without a lot of details which is as it should be he also gives us a glimpse into the trainig and organization of this elite force these are well trained brave warriors who deserve recognition for the job they do it is a well written book right to the point and worth reading if only to find out how tough the war on terrorism really is

a very useful approach for those who want to sleep easy i find professor siegel s research to be very valuable and while i probably will not follow the tenets of his strategy exactly have certainly gleaned many important lessons from this book which have already served me well siegel s previous book stocks for the long run made the case for long term investing in stocks over any year period no asset class has outperformed them not bonds not real estate nothing in this book siegel expands on that research presenting a methodology for choosing stocks which will be held over the long run to take advantage of the wealth accumulation the stock market can provide siegels approach is very value oriented and quite conservative he advocates choosing stocks with high yields dividends in sectors that have consistently performed well and in companies where management has a tried and true approach that has not changed these firms must also have low p e ratios which indicates that wall street s expectations of them are somewhat low over time he argues these quality companies will continue to beat wall street s expectations and with dividends reinvested compound the wealth of anyone who follows this approach for someone who would like relative piece of mind in the stock market and who doesn t want to be constantly shifting his or her portfolio this book is invaluable it helps someone choose stocks that have performed for generations and will lead investors to a lot of sleep easy type stocks like hershey foods for example on the other hand there will be some volatility in the mix siegels top performer is the cigarette manufacturer altria the old phillip morris whose future as a company never quite seems completely certain the benefit of this siegel argues is that as problems arise such as lawsuits the dividend remains constant which means that at dividend time more shares are bought than would be under normal circumstances which creates tremendous value for the long term investor in the form of more shares detractors of siegel s method cite taxation of capital gains as a primary concern and indeed this is an issue siegel does treat this issue albeit briefly and suggests that a financial planner can assist someone in choosing the most tax beneficial investment account the argument can also be made that followers of siegel s methods would have missed out on the biggest names of the last years walmart microsoft home depot etc but his argument is that while great new firms like these do at times come along most of the time people pay way too much for the next best thing and thus the long term value he seeks is not there siegels theory of the new global economy is also fascinating and he makes a good case why all the outsourcing occurring in the united states today may not be such a bad thing the one minor flaw i found with siegel s work is that it is sometimes fairly laborious reading but in thoroughly covering a subject as complex as this one i believe that s to be expected overall siegel s work leaves the impression of no stone left unturned calling his research data selective to me makes no sense hes not touting altria or any other stock but rather showing why over the last or so years such companies have done as well as they have he s not even really selling a method per se the buy the dogs of the dow approach has been around for a long time and telling investors to seek the best s p companies according to certain criteria is also nothing new were he recommending specific stocks moving forward i d give the data mining argument some thought but as he s not i d have to say that all in all his research is fair and objective 
best actuarial book nothing else to say the best book for actuarial mathematics also good for risk managers in particular for operational risk

this is a wonderful life changing book i love mccarthy s book his writing is enjoyable which is how all writing should be it was a pleasure to learn from this man i recently started studying anything i could find about peace and this book was the second one i read after searching at the local library i now have an idea how much literature there is out there about non violence mccarthy has successfully urged me to keep reading about this subject besides his occasional description of other sources mentioned throughout his book he even put a section at the end that lists additional authors and their titles for further study as a result of reading his book i find that i would like to help in any way i can to make the world a better place through teaching non violence 
a work of applied philosophy on of the most basic conflicts in any management is the conflict between quality do it right and output do it fast crosby starts our with the typical north american assumption that the two are embroiled in a zero sum game and then he blows the lid off suggesting that by focusing on quality you can increase throughput for example by spending tens of thousands dollars on education to prevent heart attacks now spent only on a targeted risk group a health insurance company could avert heart attacks later saving a million dollars or more for a second example if a manufacturing table has physical waste scrap and labor waste rework of bad parts both can be eliminated by having zero defects in the first place with a net increase in performance crosby also spends a little bit of time talking about how to inspire the workforce to save money with a buck a day program then crosby provides step bystep suggestions on how to implement those philosophies in a manufacturing environment i give the book four stars because it is a little dated and is heavily oriented toward manufacturing still this is a classic in the quality movement if you are studying quality don t go for the five page summary of crosby s ideas go to the source

an enjoyable and education experience having read and then re read this book over the years i must confess my puzzlement at some reviewers who can t grasp the excitement of the story i won t bore you by repeating what has already been written about the plot but let me share what i found fascinating the personal transformation of the book s protagonist ciff stoll is so compelling because he demonstrates that rare and most valuable tool in science a mind willing to expand and grow cliff by his own admission is your typical left coast liberal with knee jeck reactions to any government agency carries a three letter acronom yet through his own investigation cliff is led to discard some prior conclusions and even personal bias to embrace a new as he puts it more mature understanding although he is still on the political left he realizes he is like every other adult a stake holder in society and he has a real and very personal responsibility so cliff is drawn into a year of frustrating communication with these very agencies he would have once considered enemies of freedom in place of the utra rightwing attitudes he discovered to his dismay somethng far more harmful for our nation a miserable conglomeration of overlaping agencies all of which have no clear authority to act and further handicaped by congressional mandates that forbid domestic action and encourage and sometimes even forbid intra agency communication anything shared with them is like dropping information into a black hole the will not even coordinate and instread just whatch him struggle even when they know more than he does which is a rarity it is frustrating to read about let alone live though it is amazing that stoll didn t just give up when met over and over with an unfeeling government that didn t really care and a system almost perfectly designed for failure even though some individuals in the system were really wonderful knowledgeable and civic minded stolls is the classic story of the underdog bucking the system and against all odds winning he is one of the most unlikely heros and yet you will grow to like him a lot if every educator in this country could explain the complex as well as doctor stoll does education would markedly improve he has a unique ability to speak at the level of his readers even though he is clearly capable of far more complex explainations no matter what you knowledge of computers or lack thereof this book is an enjoyable and education experience !

a social commentary bernard goldberg is an emmy award winning correspondent and author in this book he identifies celebrities journalists radicals and intellectuals whom he criticizes for denigrating the united states he also examines the erosion of american culture that occurs when selfishness cynicism and vulgarity replace old fashioned civility respect and decency mr goldberg seems right on the mark and he makes his case with quite candor the book also does a good job of showing the cultural divide that exists at present in the u sa this book does contain some strong language 
refreshing read a really interesting and inspiring story appropriate for people of all ages you won t be able to put it down 
a great survey of the army that defeated fascism the point of this book is that the united states after watching the first few years of the war became itself a massive war power of nearly unparalleled strength the book describes how these citizen soliders came to be soldiers and what they did once they were it is full of valuable historical information for instance the number of american men classified as f or unfit for military service is astoundingly large primarily this is attributed to poor nutrition due to the depression like most wwii ambrose books there s some overlap with his other titles however this is a great encyclopedic volume that details the war in europe and how americans were critical to that victory 
great selection i received this book as a gift and at first i thought names would be too many to look through but the lists really helped me narrow things down plus my husband and i had a lot of fun flipping to random pages and seeing what we d find !

good no nonsense guide to all sorts of tax situations this book tries it s hardest to explain taxes in an easy to understand fashion for us normal people who don t have time to look through those extremely complex irs instructions and other gibberish they give us taxpayers the book does a pretty decent job of it too however to accomplish that flawlessly in my humble opinion is impossible overall any individual or small business that needs a few clues on how to do your taxes can benefit from this book i can t wait for the edition to come out 
refreshing and honest of the many volumes on the subject i find this book to be the best told with charm and grace nellie connally relates the events of november as only an occupant of that ill fated presidential lincoln could devoid of conjecture or theories we are simply presented with the facts the connally s viewpoint from the jumpseats is sobering pivotal moments from mrs connally s last words to president kennedy to governor connally near fatal wounds to oswald s emergency room visit after the jack ruby shooting are covered in a comfortable format making one feel that mrs connally is relating the events to you personally thank you mrs connally

most overlooked book of past years reading this brilliant novel i can t help but thinking what a shame it is the author remains largely unknown part fitzgerald part bukowski ames is a master of noticing st person male neuroses but and is as inventive with his characters and dialogue as any modern out there ! aone with a sense of humor needs to read this hysterically funny this is a book you ll read in one sitting not because of simplistic style but because it s that damn good oh and you ll never look at a transexual the same way again 
who are you if you are a classical player you probably shouldn t be picking up a classical book with easy in the title don t you think i m a fingerpicker and when i get stuck in a merle travis rut this book is a great way to get out of it nothing all that hard but well presented and chosen my only complaints are the same as some other reviewers the biographies would be better replaced with some technical notes if i feel the sudden need to read about sor s life there s always google also wire bound would be nice so i wouldn t have to prop up my tuner and a beer can to hold the book open

mr thoreau s work walden fortunately i read the annotated walden annotated by phillip van doren stern thank goodness i chose it without mr van doren stern s introduction side bars pictures and comments i think i would have been thoroughly lost i have to agree with a few of the reviewers who stated how pompous thoreau sounds he does he tries to act superior only to have the side bar notations state something different something that a friend mentioned for example he says he could easily do without the post office yet a contemporary sanborne is quoted off to the side of the annotated version as having said about this quote few residents of concord frequented the post office more punctually or read the newspapers more eagerly than thoreau he contradicts himself constantly he mocks people who don t read and then says he barely read a few pages of one book in the two years he was at walden pond he could be vindictive lashing out at flint s pond and mr flint because flint would not let him build a cabin on his pond he comes off as a snob saying most men learn to read only as a necessity for work to add up their profits but true readers are hard to come by i aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this concord soil has produced yet he also has some really great words of wisdom he questions the wisdom in working so hard during the best part of your life youth only to spend the fruits of your labor during the least valuable part of it enjoy life while you are young why work so hard when the endgame is death he comments on things that are still true to this day fashion and our obsession with appearance work to provide for yourself not to overburden yourself and keep yourself in debt someone reviewing this book on amazon wrote that it was a failed experiment that he meant to live in the woods as a hermit of sorts and failed miserably to do so that was never the extent of his experiment he never says he s going to lead a solitary life he states he visited the village every day or two as i walked in the woods to see birds and squirrels so i walked in the village to see men and boys i find myself having mixed feelings regarding this book he is so contradictory but then so am i he can be judgemental and then he can be spot on it was a difficult book to get through again had i not had the annotated version i would have been truly lost he frustrated me at times i was not reading literature i was reading someone s diary that often went off tangent like this review is it top book worthy my opinion no it was good at times painful at others i took months to trudge through it all the while reading other books just to keep me going i am glad i read it i won t do it again though sorry mr thoroea 
quck interesting read although there is no doubt in my mind that patton is one of the most brilliant generals of th century usa blumenson seems to be a bit biased towards this controversial figure he rationalizes all of the various controversies that surrounded patton to put patton in the best light there is no controversy or dirt dug up on patton here otherwise a fairly quick and very interesting examination of the life of patton 
a lot of excellent detail this is a very good book for learning the details of implementing the finite volume method in computational fluid dynamics i view it as very complimentary to s v patankar s book which is more general in nature both books are geared toward people who want to write computer programs to solve fluid transport problems heat transfer navier stokes etc both tend to focus on numerical issues as opposed to the physics of transport phenomena but while pantankar s book provides a very easy approachable introduction that is thin on the details ferziger amp peric have written a book rich in details for instance they devote an entire chapter to solving linear systems of equations they compare all of the commonly used methods and contrast their rates of convergence for various test cases this level of detail is great if you already understand the big picture i think it may be somewhat difficult for someone new to cfd to really understand the finite volume method from this book alone i would recommend patankar s book for a good intro and this book for the implementation details

a stunning portrait of a great artist at work jerome robbins is brought to vivid life in this amazing and stunning pictorial biography using hundreds of rare fascinating never beforeseen photographs robbins personal journals robbins own words about work combined with conrad s insightful narrative this book shines a light on the man behind the image and takes us inside his working process and his daily life he was obviously a very private man who shielded his personal life but conrad takes us behind the austere public image because of her longstanding relationship with robbins conrad was given access to previously unseen early childhood and early dance photographs and robbins own drawings and writings any creative person in any field will be grateful for the descriptions of his unique working methods conrad doesn t gloss over his disappointments or personal failures the story behind his firing from the film of west side story is fascinating but she chooses to concentrate on illuminating his artistic process and bringing the man to life with all his quirks his humor his fierce dedication to work and the great personal sacrifices he made for that work don t miss out on a wonderful and original reading experience ! i loved it an absolute treasure

smashing history of congress and phil burton john jacobs has done a spectacular job of capturing and relating the career of congressman phil burton a swaggering ruthless liberal from san francisco who came within one vote of serving as house majority leader in for anyone who wants to understand the history of the contemporary congress they need only read quota rage for justice quot and quotthe ambition and the power quot by john barry which tells the story of congressman jim wright the man who beat burton by that one vote both books are chock with candid interviews and revealing anecdotes and written with style each serves as a model of congressional biography 
my head still hurts i have long been a steven pinker fan it is great to have a neurologist appear who can explain the workings of the brain in a fairly easy to understand often humorous and precise way words rules though made my head hurt i felt a little like the rat in flowers for algernon a vague feeling that i might have understood this more easily at one time not too long ago but boy is this difficult to wade through now which is to say i blame myself rather than pinker i think it s a very difficult subject and my tenuous grasp of grammar didn t help unlike his previous books an actual understanding of the parts of speech helps here that said delving into the minutiae of how the brain works is ultimately rewarding even if i only understood maybe of this watching vicariously as pinker et al close in how how we think and talk is truly awesome i find myself paying close attention to how i speak how i hesitate in choosing words what associations i seem to need to find a word or person very cool though you can probably get sucked into some kind of fugue state if you overdo it still highly recommended but make sure you re snowed in somewhere and have a lot of coffee george 
this book is a must have i m a sociology major who got this book at the recommendation of one of my teachers it is a very helpful book though it would be nice if it included parsons structural functionalism as well 
best book available on the subject this book is extremely well done and spells out the history of american involvement in the pacific after much better than anything else on the market although miller s war plan orange is also an interesting book but from the navy s point of view i feel this one is much better done highly recommend this work to anyone wanting background on the pacific war 
best haunted house novel ever written this book is one of the scariest horror novels ever written and the best haunted house novel period no lesser scribe than stephen king has also expressed that sentiment this book has no faults it moves with a stream lined precision and ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable pitch before coming to a satisfying conclusion made into an excellent film in 
superb reading by jeremy irons jeremy irons does an excellent reading of evelyn waugh s classic novel he very poignantly captures much of the depth and emotion of each of the characters i highly recommend this audio version 
spiked i read very few non fiction books and most of them are histories i do read journalism every day but this is a first in that i ve just finished reading and am now reviewing an entire book comprised solely of journalism ahem it was a christmas gift and so what do i think about this book about killed or spiked seems to be the operative word in journalese at least in this book pieces of journalism i feel grateful to the gods or fate or genes or whatever powers that may be or may not be that i never felt compelled to go into journalism even joe conason whose blurb for the book tops the front cover says in his review for salon that the overall effect of the book is one of depression true literary endeavours with which i m more familiar can be just as cruel and cutthroat when it comes to publication but this is to be expected in the arts it s either feast or famine mostly famine one ends up working for the sake of art itself if it ends up finding grace with some publisher or agent it s a nice lagniappe if not not but journalists are in it to have their work published posthaste it s not so much that these pieces were killed that irks one although of course that plays a part it s the red intoothandclaw nature of the day in and day out life of a journalist that i found monumentally depressing well a few comments and i m done the most robust article unsurprisingly is p j o rourkes a ramble through lebanon written in o rourkes uncanny inimitable style combining erudition with a keen eye and ear for the absurdities of life the spike was made by tina brown who ends up being the killer of many of these pieces who simply wrote you can t make fun of people dying what a blockhead ! it s clear that ms tina brown has no sense of nuance or irony or she would have seen that this is exactly not what o rourke is doing here i consider myself lucky that i had never even heard of her before reading this book award for eccentricity tad friend s article jesus worms on an engaging few days spent with eccentric and histrionic brit travel writer redmond o hanlon i ve read o hanlons works and fancy them regardless of the obvious fact that you have to take them with more than a few pinches of salt he belongs to that dr livingston i presume tradition of intrepid eccentric brits losing themselves in various hearts of darkness to cheerfully emerge and write memoirs that encourage people like noel coward to write pieces like mad dogs and englishmen the only thoroughly enjoyable piece of the lot finally easily the finest piece of reportage here splendidly well written and well documented is john entine s the stranger thantruth story of the body shop this piece clearly deserves some sort of award i m so out of touch with this whole journalistic enterprise that i don t know what sorts of awards are bestowed on pieces like this one but whatever they are this piece is worth the entire book i d never heard of the body shop either but i have no compunction now in saying that some public spirited citizen should have taken an acetylene torch to these stores long ago to restate this superb writing and investigation all for nought make it also one of the most depressing stories of the bunch thats it the book was well worth the read but i m plunging back into literary fiction tomorrow 
particle physisists made accessible as someone who barely made it through high school physics i approached this book with some trepidation but much like sagan gleick gives understandable insight into the issues during the development of particle physics feynman s genius shows itself for a much longer period of his life than most physicists whose major contributions occur early in their careers feynman s passion for real solutions to real problems is made clear in dozens of anecdotes in the book three cheers and five stars for gleick and feynman one marvels at both while reading this book insightful and incredible

documenting s self indulgence i started reading this book through the library when it originally came out in and i was hooked on it finally i thought an open book into the thoughts through writtings of some of the most prominent contemporary artists of the day now i have finally acquired my own copy and i am thoroughly enjoying it again do not expect literary masterpieces from this anthology these are not authors in the strict sense of the words but mostly visual and multi media artists who included writings in their opus they are not manifestos or critical pieces not a lot of great ideas either but just writings as self indulgent as the s post modern art to which they belong if you like the art from these artists you will enjoy their writings 
great breadth of languages tools and examples great breadth of languages tools and examplesthis is the most comprehensive regular expressions book i have seen after steering you through some regular expressions essentials about pages or the first of the book it then gets into specifics and examples for all of the following languages and applications starofficeopenofficeorg writermicrosoft word and vba for microsoft wordfindstrpowergrepexcelsql server mysqlmicrosoft accessjavascript and jscriptvbscriptvb netcphpxml schemajavaperlmost other books i ve seen concentrate just on perl for anyone who uses or more of these languages or applications and who doesn t use at least that many this is much more useful than a perl reg ex book beyond the list of languages and applications covered there are numerous examples in every chapter that can easily be used as is or modified to fit your needs a few of the examples are converting dates to international formatfinding words in close proximity in the same sentence cleaning up an online chat transcriptvalidating a social security numberignoring whitespaceseparating a delimited string into partsfinding repeated words or charactersadding links to urlsmatching canadian postal codesverifying ip address formatfinding html xhtml header elementsmatching telephone numbers 
a haunting story about love and full of mystery this book surprised me in that i enjoyed it so much i mean i have always loved king s work but this one resolidified me as a fan and more proof that king knows exactly what he s doing when he writes the book surrounds mike noonan a writer who s young wife dies suddenly after four years of writer s block and never being able to move on noonan goes to stay at their summer cabin sara laughs in a small you guessed it maine town what follows is a story about lost loves new friendships and love haunted houses and a secret that the town has had hidden for over years for some it might be long pages but i found its pace to be so good you end up reading it into the wee hours of the night this is one of those books i just couldn t put down because i wanted to know the solution to the mysteries definetly read this book in a way it s so unlike king s normal ventures because it has a whodunit feel that is not common to his novels

beautiful collection please understand that a writer s style is not always indicative of the type of writing he she likes to read i think those expecting a side splitting collection of stories will be disappointed here this being said i think sedaris has compiled a wonderful collection of stories i am encouraged that sedaris included a short by alice munro one of the masters of the short story in modern times a definite must

the most exciting book i ve read this year no i m not being sarcastic i mean it big year is full of laughs twists and yes some touching moments i love bird watching and road trips but the guys in big year are hard core competitors who operate on an entirely different plain than the novices the book is so well written that you can almost see yourself sitting in the backseat of sandy komito s skuamobile as he prowls down the highway looking for birds in fact it s so vivid that big year would actually make a darn good movie while reading it i kept imagining james cagney or oscar levant as komito gregory peck or walter pigeon as al levantin and a very young jimmy stewart as greg miller the wonderful optimist who decides to do a big year on the cheap the things these guys encounter while pursuing their passion such as mountain lions cowboys with potbellied pigs the horrors of economy flight crocodiles frozen graves and icy cold outhouses are the stuff of adventure novels with a good sized dollop of comedy thrown in the big year is fascinating fun and daydream inducing i and most of the readers of the book will probably never get closer to a big year than vicariously through the book but after reading it i have started thinking that maybe just maybe i could survive a one county big day i loved the book and even my non nature loving friends found themselves laughing out loud when i read sections of it to them 
must read having two teenagers one of each sex i found this book extremely insightful it explains why they act the way they do and tells how to handle these turbulent times a must read for all who are rasing or about to raise a teenager 
no cd rom and nowhere to be found on net book is worth the price however there in no cd rom included with the book and the directions given at the front of the book regarding where to download the software is incorrect neither the author s nor the publisher s websites offer the software for anyone except professors adopting the book i am tempted to return the book just for that shabby attention to details 
masterfully written i have read few books that are so well written this book is enjoyable for the story line and the characters but almost more enjoyable for mccall smith s masterful writing i savor every sentence for its humor and whimsy he also has great insight into human nature and paints our idiosyncrasies in a kinder light that makes the reader feel more inclined to give everyone the benefit of the doubt 
fantastic you know the plot rebellion against authority you ve seen it re hashed a hundred times but never treated this well in cuckoos nest kesey has made the authority palpably evil malicious and vindictive he s made the innocents perfectly pitiable he s made the rescuer a brash brawler fueled by testosterone not admirable but respected all the same the big nurse embodies the tyranny of small minds who gain power absolute power over those who are helplessly subject to them she rules with cold authority over her ward of mental patients twisting them inside so that they ll never escape her machinations until randall mcmurphy appears in the ward having conned his way in to avoid work detail in prison thus begins a battle of the wills that is full of high comedy and tragic results even told through the perspective of a giant indian mental patient mcmurphy s acts are not glossed over as the pranks of a fun loving mischevious kid the hatred that he and all patients on the ward have for the big nurse seeps out of the pages mcmurphy s goal is to make them into men not cowering rabbits and his final pyrrhic victory transforms the men around him this is a modern classic that you will not be able to forget 
it isn t cat in the hat but this book is good but for an adult maybe not as good as some of the others with a stronger storyline this is mostly a book of rhyming however having said that my daughter age likes the book and loves to look at the pictures they are great illustrations to look through and pick out things like where are his eyes can you find his feet the rhymes are also fun and interesting combinations

a must have for ford fans and any film library i ve just finished this and i have to agree with a critic who reviewed quotabout john ford quot for the times of london one of the best books published by a filmmaker on a filmmaker it certainly is the author lindsay anderson was himself a distinguished director quoto lucky man quot quotifquot a longtime admirer of the films of john ford and a damn fine writer on the subject anderson uses clear and thoughtful prose and a great copious selection of stills to illustrate his take on many ford movies from his classics such as quotthe searchers quot to less often discussed titles quotthey were expendable quot the silents not a dull page in the book not always the case with film studies lots of humor great frankness and best of all several chapters detailing interviews and encounters anderson had with quotthe old man quotpriceless stories that give the reader a real flavor of ford for better or worse reading this book produces two tremendous urges first to watch all the films discussed again and second to make movies a classic 
great reading this is a delightful book both with the recipes and for reading i bought one for one of my daughter in laws also and she loved it also

yet another alltime great this guy knew how to write about love in all of it s phases yet never or rarely descended into mawkishness and a lot of his considerable output is classic buy it if you have to skip lunch for a week if you ve never read sturgeon before you re in for a treat language of a grace and power to rival bradbury and a way of moving along jauntily that compares with henry kuttner lewis padgett and alfred bester

literature that rightfully make us proud to be japanese if ever criticized the temple of the golden pavilion by yukio mishima is chided most frequently for some of its seemingly mundane superfluous and repetitive details and paragraphs many give up or decide not to read it at all since the text appears heavy and unmanageable from the very first page however after analyzing the book and enduring challenges one should come to realize the book s deeper meanings mishimas writing is filled with archetypes and symbols that reoccur throughout the novel which may seem repetitive but are utterly paramount and necessary to encourage deeper thought within the reader after studying a chapter or two one can make connections using these archetypes as a guide to interpret the book for example the seasons and the weather reflect the state of mind of the protagonist mizoguchi descriptive words such as brilliant and bright are premonitions of future events other distinctly repeated archetypes include colors water and fire they are repeated for the sake of emphasis which help the reader to stay intact with the extraordinary world that mishima creates the temple of the golden pavilion is famous for mind boggling its readers a way one can come to terms with the frequent juxtapositions in the book is by researching a little about the author s background then one will realize that mishima incorporated his own philosophies and experiences in the character of mizoguchi which resulted in an active voice in its narrations almost as if mishima was talking to you personally this may explain why the book seems abstract yet realistic absurd yet understandable some characteristics of mizoguchi we can relate with others are puzzling and enigmatic it is striking to think that the main happenings of the novel actually happened a stuttering young monk did in fact set fire to the golden temple after becoming obsessed with its beauty as cited in the introduction of the book the plot is simple and its synopsis can be predicted through reading the introduction and the blurb mishima focuses acutely on the insight of the distressed monk s mind even forcing the reader to unexpectedly sympathize with the mentally different protagonist this may be the reason why some readers find mishima s book hard to understand or not fruitful a reader cannot expect to obtain anything productive out of this book simply from the plot alone its true value can be attained through reading the book proactively with care the temple of the golden pavilion has become internationally accepted possibly because of its universal philosophical messages unique writing style and also precisely for its absurdness it is an esoteric piece of writing it is loved by individuals intellectuals who are able to enjoy and appreciate quality writing while carefully deciphering its many conundrums but it is dismissed by those seeking a lighter read for more in depth information and analysis please visit httpgoldenpaviexblogj 
captivating unforgettable i watched the movie three years ago and still come vividly tomy mind so i decided to buy the book and it was much better than the movie this book really moved me and left me to tears i found myself reading it until o clock in the morning could not put the book down and hoping at the end that ishmael and hatsue can get back together this is the best book i have ever read thanks to the author a masterpiece well written and hypnotizing i would really like to meet him and i am also planning a trip to canada and us to see the place where the movie was filmed 
elizabethan first time i read this book i considered it pretty much a bunch of sex scenes strung together with philosophical ramblings later i went back to it for another try and i m glad i did it s an incredible book it feels elizabethan not just in the language not just in the historical accuracy but in every detail of the characters thought and sensibility that s typical of burgess at the very top of his game it also makes amends in plenty for anyone who was disgusted by the attitude toward homosexuality portrayed in the wanting seed in fact remembering that burgess had written this book was the only thing that kept me from flinging tws across the room well that and the fact that it was a library book readers interested in marlowe will also find an insightful if maybe not totally groundbreakingly original view of his philosophy life and plays and the relationship between them 
good for wannabe animators as well this book does not really go into serious figure drawing nothing photo realistic and to many that s a good thing ! finally a book that tries to instil a realistic view on why figure drawing is fun and sometimes painful figure drawing is like masochistic sex in a way a significant protion of this book is devotes to the figure in motion which is so much more interesting that the still figure this book makes you want to have your drawing pencil dance on the dreaded blank paper 
accessible and rigorous alan jacobs is an english professor at wheaton college home of the wade center the largest collection of original lewis writings and extant works in the world as well as the inspirational wardrobe and lewis beer mug it shows it becomes obvious early on in this text that he is intimately familiar with lewis s writings and letters it is robust and well documented while being readable and interesting and well worth the pages i brought it with me on a recent visit to oxford and found it made the university come alive with the formidable specters of lewis tolkein and charles williams a couple of other thoughts this is without a doubt a sympathetic biography a friend of mine called it gushing and jacobs sticks up for lewis against all his detractors but he also deals plainly with less savory his subjects life the nature of his relationship with minto and his falling out with tolkein and in all is an able biographer there is some repetition of letters and quotes i this found helpful rather than redundant as different stages of his life and thought were tied together but it is worth noting 
it s the best book in the whole wid world many people of all ages will like this book shiloh season if you like the book look through and look at all the pages that have pictures read and find out what happens to an abused dog rescued by a boy named marty 
a wonderful book for children at the age i read this book at the library now six years later i finally got my hands on it again and read it word for word it s even better than the last time when i finished i had tears streaming down my face but from happiness the story opens up in the city of turmoil where a group of children decide to cause mischief that day some time later they see a stranger they are fascinated by him for they have never met someone so beautiful kind the wanderer is horrified and disgusted by the evil in the city he shows five of the children and five other adults the burdens of dishonesty deceit and many other things that they carry suddenly they have heavy sacks on their backs that they can t remove they have to journey to the city of happiness in the land of far beyond to get rid of them so begins the journey of ten people who must face difficulties and challenges to get to their destination they meet people like mr doubt and laziness who try to discourage them or tempt them they also meet people like content and daring who help them along and get them out of trouble they learn a lot of things along the way it is best to face up to your fears fright is less scary when seen in the light of day and so on and meet evil dwarves angels a cruel giant etc finally the remaining few who completed the journey got their burdens removed by the prince of peace who carries the burdens of the whole world it is jesus and the land they are in is heaven

a story through the eyes of an innocent year old child amidst unspeakable horror my number one reading consultant john from matilda s book store in mount waverley recommended this book to me without giving any hint of what the story was about which i am grateful for since the book speaks for itself it is about a year old german boy named bruno who has to move from berlin to the countryside because his father has a new position brunos sees a fence and buildings and a lot of people wearing what he calls striped pyjamas but he does not realize that he is caught in the middle of the holocaust of word war two at the auschwitz concentration camp and the one friend that he makes is of the jewish race this book has a lot of significance for me because my mother grew up in germany at the time when this book is set and she has told me that like bruno a large percentage of grown up german people were unaware of the horrors that jews in wartime germany had to endure this book is told with the innocence of youth and yet is dark and compelling at the same time this book was so rivetting that i finished it in one afternoon sitting thanks again john for yet another great book 
nancy drew for adults if you enjoyed nancy bess george and ned as a child you will find comparable delight with mariah stewart s books moderate suspense minimal gore unoffensive language steamless romance and characters who fight for truth and justice without the aid of pyrotechnics a nice change up from the standard twisted fare that has become the norm 
i haven t laughed so much over anything since the hogs ate my kid brother when a continental detective agency operative arrives in personville he little realizes what he s walking into his employer turns up dead before the op can even meet with him so he starts looking into the death it seems that the deceased crusading newspaper publisher donald willsson wanted to see personville poisonville as it s known to anyone familiar with the crooked town cleaned up there s two ways to clean up a town you can go don willsson s way and try to handle everything all legally and above board and that got him killed or you can turn the bad guys against each other and let them clean up each other this continental op is no push over and when he wants a job done he wants it done thoroughly so before he knows it he s up to his neck in murder and mayhem i love detective stories and read them all the time but dashiell hammett is not your everyday mystery writer he s the originator of the hardboiled detective story sherlock holmes hercule poirot jessica fletcher forget it those birds wouldn t last ten minutes in poisonville this is a great story of murder without conscience and violence without compunction this story was first published in and it is a great story i love the characters and the way that they interact but even better is the dialogue including the quote above overall i think that this is a great story if you like tough two fisted crime fiction then this is the book for you it s a great book by the king of his genre ! 
this one is personal i have been reading the inspector banks series of books in sequence since in a dry season i suspect i will go back and pick up the stories prior to that one later in reading the books the way i have been reading them i have come to know the mai character pretty well as the author had intended it there had been substantial foreshadowing of one of the murders invrestigated in this book alan banks had always brought up the memory of his friend graham marshall and his unexpected disappearance in his previous books robinson had brought the memory up as an example of bank s guilt and messy history it punctuated his complexity as a person and how that complication marks his life so far and his work as a detective as such this book should have been the most emotional and cathartic instead it was pretty much business as usual wich was disappointing but it also underscores the fact that there is really nothing cathartic in police work peter robinson is an extraordinary writer or else i never would have read this many books in such a short time his device of interweaving two separate story lines together would be disastrous in the hands of an amateur but in robinson s hands it is as natural as can be he steers the narrative easily amongst the stories and builds the tempo of the story equally until the two lines comes to a parallel climax in this book the climax wasn t a real climax it was just an ending an explanation for the crimes i didn t exactly feel cheated since i got my enjoyment out of the process of building the case and edging further into the story the nice moments of charater building was appropriate and it served to pull the reader into the character made us sit notice of alan banks and annie cabbot and jenny fuller one more note robinson could have used the same plotting device as in a dry season soince both this story and that one involved going into the past to get at the truth but he refrained i think it may have hurt his narative somewhatbut i also think it was pretty brave of him to lay off the same device and stay with this plotting device just to stay fresh in the end the confrontation with bank s past was somewhat of a let down the other story was actually quite engrossing it did not quite supercede the graham marshall story but it came close this whole book had the feel of an intermediate step to somewhere else but coming on the end of aftermath it was good to get into a standard whodunnit 
we only want the government to talk with us and to say that we are not traitors so said one of the student leaders as quoted by shen tong himself a leader in almost a revolution this is a very fluidly written personal acount of the events leading up to the killings of workers students by chinese soldiers in tiananmen square beijing on june fortunately with more recent events in ukraine soviet georgia tajikistan even lebanon not forgetting eastern europe we have seen how revolutions gain strenth often like tropical storms that develope into hurricanes with surprising rapidity meteorologically we can explain such happening on the weather front once they occur but we re rarely capable of predicting such developements until they are almost in our faces so to speak the event that sparked events in china was the death of hu yaobang on april th hu yaobang had become something of a hero since he had been made the scapegoat of the student movement and ousted as general secretary and many of us says the author had hoped that he would be brought back someday to lead china on the road to reform acknowledgement of his passing by many however soon began to be read by the government as a renewed call for reform thus began the chain of events that resulted in students boycotting classes printing flyers and finally camping out in tiananmen square in the author s view there was clearly an internal struggle going on between li peng a hardliner and zhao ziyang a chinese leader who had declared on may th his openness to a dialogue with the students evidence of such was the fact that starting may the press in china operated without censorship from the goverment for a few days mikhail gorbachev had arrived for a visit days earlier and the chinese government was seemingly caught off guard in the headlights of the world s media for a moment while it contemplated how to respond a mass protest in beijing s central square the one fault of this book besides no index is that the author has nothing to say about this visit by gorbachev he mentions the soviet leader s arrival and departure but literally nothing otherwise no impressions or anything how such a visit affected events on the ground in beijing or within the corridors of the chinese government this was before the collapse of eastern europe mind you but i find it hard to believe that the issue of gorbachev glasnostreform wasn t a topic of discussion amongst at least some of the student leaders arrayed around shen tong back to events martial law was declared on may on may word began to filter out that zhao ziyang had been removed as general secretary of the chinese communist party though it wasn t announced until may th the crackdown came soon after but the author wasn t as much a witness participant to this aspect as he was in all the events leading up to it he doesn t consequently write much about the tanks entering beijing or the famous photograph of the solitary man courageously standing his ground before one particular one or what exactly happened that day he doesn t even guess at how many chinese were killed but this is nevertheless a remarkable story that reads quickly gives much interesting detail of the author s childhood particularly as it relates to his coming to question things the role his intellectual father had on his developement cheers ! 
not your typical king stephen king steps off into the woods and gives us trisha mcfarland she s out for a day of hiking with her mom and brother who don t get along when after a quick step off the trail she becomes lost in the wilderness this book does not have the same supernatural theme that king normally uses but this story is uneasy nonetheless getting lost in the wilderness is much more real than vampires and werewolves and king does an excellent job giving us real insight into trisha s thoughts this book is one of my favorite stephen king books

rodale was way ahead of his time with this one i bought this book on a whim when i took a master composter class and it s a fascinating read rodale is largely credited with bringing organic practises to the united states and he wrote this book apparently shortly after returning from europe where he d been doing his research his observations always are tied into his reasoning and at the time there was very little science to back up what he saw regarding health human animal plant and organic food now the science is starting to prove his thoughts were right the jist of this is that using compost transfers nutrients into plants and that these nutrients are not simple we are only just beginning to understand this maybe we are only beginning to understand that we understand very little mr rodale grasps this concept examines the science of his time as well as organic practises from all over the planet and comes up with some remarkable suggestions for the home gardner and the farmer alike his writing is a lot of fun too 
brilliant essays on collecting there are a number of essays in this book that makes it worth reading my favorites are the system of collecting by jean baudrillard collections constitute themselves as a system on the basis of which the subject seeks to piece together his world collecting and collage making the case of kurt schwitters by roger cardinal a collector s model of desire the house and museum of sir john soane by john elsner if you are a rabid collector of anything you will delight in this ultimate collection in which a man turned everything he did and his very house into a museum he made multiple catalogs of his collection throughout his life and arranged and rearranged until his death it s an amazing story there are essays in all including one on freud s statue collection cook s collection from his pacific voyages and collections of the austrian habsburgs i found it a fascinating read

the war gets uglier it is the winter of six months have passed since jake featherston president of the confederate states of america and the sarge of the ruling freedom party gave the order for the surprise attack on the united states of america but the confederacy has failed in its mission to quickly knock the usa out of the second world war and restore confederate hegemony in the western hemisphere the confederacy s grip on ohio still has the usa cut in half while c s bombers kill the president of the united states al smith in his bunker but his successor vows to continue the war and for each day that the war drags on the usa gets stronger while the csa s borrowed time slowly runs out featherston and his chief of staff nathan bedford forrest iii devise a new plan that will deliver the coup de grace to the crippled usa but will it work will operation coal scuttle bring total victory to the confederate states of america and its madman leader the blacks in the csa hope otherwise featherston s henchmen have already cleared several cities of their presence and the construction of an enormous camp in the empty texas prairie brings a terrifying new dimension to that mysterious slang term population reduction i thought this was a good book after the bangs and thrills of the first few pages the book takes a while to get started but once the operation on which the title of the book is based begins the action picks up i also liked the parallels to the civil war general macarthur s misguided attacks on fredericksburg virginia mimics ambrose burnside s assault oo december while jonathan moss gets used to life in a prison camp in the middle of georgia called andersonville we also see some new characters which means other characters die one of them was well deserved the death could not have happened to a nicer person even if the death comes at an inconvenient time plot wiseall in all a good read for the middle of a series if you re just getting started with these books then you ll do better to begin with how few remain and work your way from there but for veterans this book picks up right where return engagement ended and doesn t stop

insightful but ends in obscurity this is a must read for any postmodern web developer helps keeps your eyes from succumbing to tunnel vision ideas like web timbl tells his story and provides a great explanation of his intention for what the web really is points out that really the web is only half done and should spawn some really great killer app ideas for any smart developer the latter half of the book seems filled with tim s unclear ideas for the future which are unclear because he doesn t know getting too old to see any further perhaps such is the fate of all visionaries if you re a developer read this book it s a quick one

h pb s magnum opus blavatsky was an incredible mystic and probably the best known theosophist the secret doctrine is such an incredible work although some parts may seem to be cryptic blavatsky gives so much information and insight into the occult world it s not an easy read but i find myself rereading chapters only to find a hidden nugget that i overlooked before this is a compendium of vast esoteric knowledge and i am so grateful this scarce third volume has been made available 
terrific i hadn t read an alex cross book in over a year and wasn t sure what to expect from this novel some of the books were interesting turn pagers others were just mediocre this one might be the best of the lot however the biopic tale of two gruesome serial killers on the lose is presented brilliantly and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked until the final page terrific storywriting interesting chracters and a terrific plot kiss the girls was my favorite cross novel but this replaced it i can t remember any part of the novel well i felt i was just reading filler or wasn t the least bit interested in what was going on i had grown sour on cross novels over a year ago but this one hooked me back in 
november election adds more evidence to support right nation thesis the fascinating thing regarding the election held only two days ago was the alleged conservatism of a number of democratic party candidates some were anti abortion pro gun strongly against illegal immigration and desire victory in iraq are they conning the voters we will find out soon enough nonetheless they didn t run as liberals ! an affirmative action measure was even resoundedly rejected in the democrat dominated state of michigan admittedly the republicans lost control of both the u s senate and the house of representatives but newly elected virginia senator and viet nam war hero james webb will probably irritate his left wing democrat cohorts british journalists john micklethwait and adrian wooldridge wrote right nation before the election they clearly saw that a decent size majority of american voters substantially embrace conservative themes at this point in time there is little evidence that explicit and unambiguous liberalism will stage a comeback liberal politicians will often have to pretend to be conservative this almost assuredly will continue to be the case as long as islamic nihilism threatens the globe sadly widespread economic illiteracy somewhat protects democrat politicians what happens if more voters are converted to the economic doctrines of milton friedman and ludwig von mises will the democrats face oblivion right nation may be slightly dated it is however worthy of your time if you are trying to better understand the future political trends of the united states david thomsonflares into darknes 
i loved it this is probably one of the best books i ve ever read i devoured it a lot of people compare leopold von sacher mosoch to the marquis de sade but this novel was tragically romantic i would compare it to something like wuthering heights 
a good introduction to the trail of tears this is a worthy introduction to the trail of tears for students aged and older a more compelling book is walking the trail one man s journey along the cherokee trail of tears by cherokee author jerry ellis he was the first person in modern history to walk the mile route and the book nominated for a pulitzer and national book award has been in print for years the author lectures around the globe on the trail having presented in asia africa europe and throughout the us 
invisible cities worth reading at least once i was recommended this book from my friend shortly after finishing graduate school when in need of a good detox read to me the book was far from the brainless entertainment i was hoping for in fact invisible cities was full of thought provoking and poetic images of imaginary cities expressed through dialogues between marco polo and kublia khan at first i was struck by the unusual premise for the story and then later struck by the highly symbolic descriptions of the cities through calvino s use of symbolism i began to have a different appreciation for the forms and structures of cities and civilizations this could have been the first time i really thought about cities as a living architecture and the container for our memories and dreams with all of the above said one problem i had when reading invisible cities was my mind seemed to easily drift off the page the book reads more like poetry then a novella and i felt that halfway through the book the form of the chapters became almost too redundant i think that if i were to re read the book and spend some time with it i could have gained greater insight into italo calinvo s perspective and creative mind although i am not rushing to re read it anytime soon i would possibly read it again in the future 
gorey s a scary guy even the most seemingly innocuous tale becomes bizarre and sinister in his hands thanks to his macabre claustrophobic writing style i don t remember which stories are in which amphigorey specifically but favourites include the evil garden the epileptic bicycle the gashleycrumb sp tinies and of course the wuggly ump oh and the one where the guy invites all his guests up to see his sofa and then it ends with him quotturning it on quot and them being locked in the room shudder not for the faint of heart but brilliant in the extreme don t miss it 
cosider a must have i rate this book very hight because it is a serious content concept based book for not only the exam but to really make things clear that it covers one drawback is that it does not cover it all and you might need the krutz vines or shon haris book and interaction with the still this would be a great buy because the questions at the end of the chapters are better quality than most of the books i have now known a lot of people passing exam by only using this one book disclaimer some of them have had good experiance in infosec which is expected importantly email the author and get the errata of the book so that you don t run around trying to verify some of the errors the book has though it could help doing all the additional research good luck for the exam 
excellent book i purchased it for my year old because her hair can sometimes be tough to comb she loves it i want to instill a positive outlook about herself as well as her hair i have been natural for years and i do love my hair 
also look at energy at the crossroads by vaclav smil this book has been well reviewed by others and i do not wish to reiterate their comments i have no expertise in the field but i find little to disagree with we are in trouble our lifestyle is going to change and the sooner we start dealing with it the more of our culture we can preserve i am writing to suggest another source of information which comes to the same conclusions but is a little less alarmist and which is not mentioned in heinberg s book nor in the amazon lists of what others who bought this book bought this is energy at the crossroads by by vaclav smil it was reviewed in nature one of the two most respected of our scientific journals by michael grubb who concludes it is the most sober thorough and thoughtful integrated text on energy available and it embodies core facts and some fundamental truths that any analyst of energy issues should ponder smil is an academic who has studying energy issues for years he is less inclined to forecast than heinberg having seen so many erroneous predictions however he is clear about the coming end of oil he goes into more depth on energy issues global warming and especially the alternatives to fossil fuel no great news he does not have the activist impulses of heinberg which may of course be good or too bad depending on what it takes to change course smil s book is both longer and more difficult to read because of the amount of science presented and i found it well worth the effort

nancy drew for adults this is just one of those fun books the heroine has no training other than the obligatory cop boyfriend the book is one of those great summer reads you can sit down and curl up with cece and the wacky friends family and acquaintances i read her first book i dreamed i married perry mason who could say no to that title and became thoroughly hooked 
a must read i must admit to being completely flabbergasted by the negative reviews of this novel i could barely put it down it moved me so most reviews focus on the family relationships that are hauntingly revealed by jane smiley throughout the book i also found the descriptions of the land and farming practices to be insightful and engrossing this is one book that doesn t disappoint and will stick with you for a long time 
great coffee table book very interesting everyone will find something inspiring whether you are an entrepreneur a manager an inventor or just looking to be inspired 
omg is this funny when i first discovered the onion two years ago i literally woke up with sore abdominal muscles not from too many situps from laughing out loud so hard at the most finely tuned news satire to come along in decades our dumb century features the onion s classic satire newspapers for highlighted dates throughout the th century headlines include october teddy roosevelt allows three others to be carved into mountain november loose lips sink ship and january new president feels nation s pain breasts the same date has tipper gore jerks arrhythmically at inagural ball and that s just the headlines the articles take the concepts and run not always even not always hilarious but there s something worth laughing out loud at on every page if you like to laugh read the onion 
intimate allies i am a pastor and i give this book as a gift to newleyweds i have found it to be very down toearth not like some of the howtostayinlove marriage manuals but rather focused on serving together looking at the larger world together making your relationship strong by being accountable etc i love the communal focus making marriage part of the network of society instead of just me you babe i like everything that dan allender writes filled with insight and practical wisdom

many editions to choose from this a challenging read but with film audio and interpretive editions there are an embarrassment of riches that make it a lot easier here is the strategy i followed as background reading in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex recounts the real life story that inspired melville to write moby dick and gives a good background on nantucket and the whaling industry it provides needed historical context for the modern reader that was common knowledge in the th century it was after reading this that i was inspired to read moby dick the audiobook version narrated by william hootkins hours unabridged hootkins should win an oscar for his performance i m an audiobook junkie but this is one of if not the best audiobook performance i ve heard his reading is perfect for the book i never would have picked up the amount of humor satire and sheer emotion without his professional interpretive skills every character sounds different read along the audiobook version with the norton critical edition which contains plentiful explanatory footnotes and other material such as contemporary reviews pictures maps criticisms etc see the john houston movie it s minutes and is a spoiler save it for last the sets acting costumes accents all bring it alive in glorious technocolor the film is a classic in its own right for example pip and the tambourine seems incongruous in the book but makes sense in the film and the preachers pulpit visualized with orson wells delivering the sermon is as good as it gets the novel is written in the romanticsm tradition cf lord byron sir walter scott les miserables and the language is full of symbolism and subtle layers of meaning yet strangely melville turned this emotional poetic style to a near documentary treatment of what is otherwise a fairly dry subject in minute detail it s like writing poetry about the details of the nuclear power industry from backhoes to graphite rods to cooling ponds yet somehow it worked the immersion is so complete the details so real and true of the thing melville that the main storyline becomes all that much more credible and powerful the story its self is not that complex or even original its based on a shakespeare tragedy but the symbolic depth of the language truthfulness of the details and mythological power of the characters moby dick and ahab in particular combine to make this strange sort of a book melville a canonical work 
can t be beat for the price i realize that there are books that are better and more complete about life in victorian england and regency but for the novice or one who just wants the basics this book can t be beat i felt it was well written and very understandable i guess what i really like best about it is that it gives me a whole lot of information about the lower middle class and the poorer classes especially country folk which helps tremendously in piecing together the way my ancestors may have lived i use this book and the others in this series quite often in my research 
perfect this is a perfectly executed novel not a word can be cut out or changed without ruining the story how writing used to be no even in waugh s day this book stood out i think for being mannered yet anti frilly amazingly current and timeless universal eternal themes treated include the mixing and degeneration of cultures and civilizations class consciousness imperialism i m glad it hasn t made into a movie at least i don t think it has been 
a truly fantastic adventure this is one of the most unique and interesting books i have ever read the perils of pi s adventure are of the most original concepts and are justa pure pleasure to read it is hard to talk about this book without giving away anything about the story so suffice to say that this is a must read 
great help in preparing law school apps this is a great general overview preparation and reference for working on law school applications the book provides overview and advice on interviews how to choose a law school and discusses briefly the numbers lsat gpa but i found the candid advice and examples regarding the resume personal statement and recommendations the most valuable it s easy to read and much less intimidating than some of the other popular and much lengthier books and covered most of the questions and concerns i had if you re considering law school or beginning work on law school apps this is a good place to start 
a laugh a minute fantastic fantastic fantastic i bought this book to read on a flight from the uk to australia and it had me laughing so loud i was quite an embarrassment ! i m not a chick lit kind of girl but this was a real exception as an author myself i really admire the talent it takes to write a book where almost every line makes you smile or laugh pure escapism very charming and such good fun and somehow it also manages to be a book which makes you take stock of what really counts in life this should be compulsory reading for every workaholic and certainly every lawyer enjoy 
essential biography in understanding a leader william manchester examines the life of general douglas macarthur american caesar douglas macarthur begins with his birth and ends with his death for anyone that has an interest in reading about military leaders or in general leaders of the twentieth century american caesar and its pages is an excellent starting point one thing that comes to mind when one thinks of general douglas macarthur is how he has been misunderstood by those who have not spent the time to read or understand who the man really was for every leader that has passed through history one always finds a way to tarnish the image of a leader and to debunk the myth and legend writers and critics have written about macarthur s downfall as well as his own self interest and egotism or juicy tidbits of his personal life where would the label of greatness be without those traits american caesar contains all those subjects but with much respect to the man however american caesar portrays general macarthur s unique personality as an individual with much emphasis on the man and the compassion and determination he possessed with the people and countries he associated with it is these traits which hold much prestige over the one controversy in korea that existed near the end of his service manchester carefully paths macarthur s life and takes from other scholarships archival material as well as from macarthur s memoir reminiscences to acquaint readers with the man and the many experiences he encountered during his tenure as one most of the highly decorated generals in us history manchester uses the moniker of caesar and historical references to great leaders throughout the book such as napoleon lincoln u s grant in comparing and paralleling macarthur s life to particular conflicts these leaders overcame or not to his own as an avid reader of history macarthur thrived on history manchester states that macarthur once told a reporter that his only advisors were abraham lincoln and george washington and emphasized that one founded the united states the other saved it this may have been suggesting that he was in good company with men of great acclimation and sought to reach the levels that they had achieved manchester does a fine job presenting all aspects of macarthur s life and the players that brought him up as well as brought him down for a man who greatly helped rid the world from imperialistic tyranny by the japanese during the war in the pacific he helped japan to reconstruct its government and country to what it is today who could predict what may have happened if macarthur maintained his position in korea for a man that lived in the pacific and asian theatre for years and took more precedence over the study of this region of the world he may have known more about how the people thought militarily than the men in washington many hypotheses will pop up while reading this immense book nonetheless macarthur was led on a mission to rid the world of war and accomplished it and later in his life spoke against it 
still a great introduction to insects for young people almost the first book on insects that i ever acquired was a hardbound edition of this little guide in the early s indeed i wore out several copies before i graduated to lutz s field book of insects and later more up to date guides while a bit behind in modern systematics this guide still has enchanting pictures mostly the same ones i poured over during my childhood it was here i first caught the insect bug that eventually propelled me into a career in biological sciences zim s early golden guide to insects was a magic carpet into the fantastic world of insects and i think that it must still be luring young people to at least appreciate the six legged crowd i know that the images in this book are still burned into my brain especially that of the beautiful buckeye butterfly and the various horned scarab and carrion beetles i highly recommend this book for children as a first insect book but i sort of wish they had kept the original yellow cover ! 
an enjoyably quick read the itch was a good quick read that kept my interest to the end although the situations in the characters lives could have been covered a bit more in depth the story still kept me wanting more i really hope there is a sequel to see how things will work out for abra with her new self discovery and how natasha continues on with her life after miles 
the snowmen are snow men homicide detectives leo magozzi and gina rolseth take the lead in this wintertime murder investigation set in minneapoilis a major snowfall has come to provide the material for a snowman building content but a couple snowmen are different from the others in that they contain the bodies of murdered men and policemen at that another snow man found on an iced over lake outside minneapolis turns out to be a missing parole officer it is discovered that the link between the three men is a paroled convict who has been asking after his ex wife whom he had nearly beat to death the mother and daughter team who make up pj tracy certainly know how to write a page turning book of their alternating protagonists i actually prefer the detectives but that s a personal choice i appreciate the humor in their writing offsetting the very serious subject of abuse with the completely inexperienced new sheriff in dundas county the writing is tight dialogue crisp and characters engaging the stories are fast paced and make you want the next book as soon as you ve finished the one if you looking for an enjoyable sunday afternoon read this is it 
excellent i just finished reading friedman s book and feel it is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the rapid changes effecting our world 
one of king s best i m sure lot s of other people have written vast amounts on the plot of this book so i ll try and keep it brief for people who loved the shawshank redemption king returns to writing a story about prison in the s only this time it s the death row prison where inmates have short stays a truly compelling story from page to page originally it was a serial novel split into parts the parts are in the complete novel and while sometimes there is backtracking and reiterating it does not lessen the book s qualitites what you have here is king writing as only he does his ability to take the odd supernatural and mix it with rich characters and interesting plots is why he is such an acclaimed and loved author i m sure many people have seen the film version of this book and while it is one of the most faithful to his work i still think that reading the book would be better i read many books a year and it s rare that one can actually make me tear up but the green mile made me do just that you will not be disapointed if you read this 
i was surprised this book was rather good i actually found some things local to me and i live in the middle of no where i liked this book covered a lot of areas of the u s and was pretty well written i enjoyed this book 
a beautifully written and inspiring story i am working juanico was his answer working by looking i did not understand and so i held my tongue thinking that this was what he meant me to do with his cryptic answer but a week or more later he spoke to me as if i had put my question but a moment before answering when i sit and look at something i am feeling its shape so that i shall have it in my fingers when i start to draw the outline i am analyzing the colors too for example do you see that piece of brocade on the chair what color is it blue i answered promptly no juanico there is a faint underlay of blue but there is violet in that blue the faintest touch of rose and the highlights are red and bright green look again it was magical for suddenly i could see them the other colors just as he said the eye is complicated it mixes the colors for you explained master the painter must unmix them and lay them on again shade by shade and then the eye of the beholder takes over and mixes them again i should like to paint i cried out in my joy at this revelation this is the book my rd and th grade students are reading it is an inspiring story about relationships truth and fiction are intertwined velazquez is a famous spanish painter juan de pareja was a slave velazquez inherited from his aunt s estate the reader is taken on a profound journey through the th century and introduced to many colorful and intriguing characters characters who are very real in their familiar human qualities the story is beautifully and vividly written you can t help but come to love appreciate and admire juan de pareja and diego velazquez every sentence is full of rich language taking you step by step down a path of adventure and discovery the inspiration from this book has brought forth ooohs and aaahs as we look forward to viewing the paintings by velazquez and rubens at the national gallery of art in washington d c 
now he is not just a face on the dollar at the end of the book i felt that i gained an idea of what washington was really like for me mr ellis did bring stone to life but also unexpectedly i found a little bit of comfort in reading this history in this time of war and trouble washington made a lot of mistakes lost most of the battles but won the war anyway 
every man fights his own war i salute this author for his writing talents of transporting us literally into another space and time that not many of us will ever know of i can only imagine the horrors of what our fathers went through i can only hope that i should one tenth as brave as they were i can only hope that it never happens again jones use of the written word in this work is comparative in a way to the late great thomas wolfe and another virginia woolfas lyrical poetry in a technical development five stars

an emotional read but well worth the effort this books helps to understand the why of an extramarital affair especially the entangled affair i was the infidel and the shame of what i had done threw me even deeper into depression and a confused state of mind my counselor recommended the book for me amp my husband i read the book my husband did not it helped me to realize i was not alone and not a horrible person i stood by and took my husband s anger because i felt i deserved it but i feel if he had read the book it would have helped him more than me my personal belief is that both spouses should read the book to get a better understanding of why the affair happened and how to recover i m giving it four stars because i have not read another book on extramarital affairs for comparison 
bill moggridge s masterpiece i made the mistake of opening the amazon box yesterday it contained bill moggridge s brand new page book designing interactions i have several talks to prepare and a bunch of other stuff to do but i forgot all about them once i started reading the book bill has been at ground zero of the design thinking movement for years starting has own industrial engineering firm years and then joined david kelley mike nuttall to form ideo as what was then the first full service design firm and has now broadened to become an innovation firm that helps companies develop innovative products processes customer experiences and organizational designs i ve known bill for about a decade and have always been touched by both his grace and brilliance and range of skills and they are all on display in this beautiful book bill is perhaps best known as the designer of the grid the first laptop computer in but that is just one of the many many designs he has contributed to this book using interviews with many of the most influential and important people and their stories in the product design and innovation world over the past years or so demonstrates what design thinking is and how great people do it read it studying it talk about it i ve read a lot of books on creativity and design i ve try to study it teach it apply it myself but while there is a lot of good stuff out there this is the masterpiece the top of the pops if you are going to read one book on how to do creative work in the real world this is it the images the stories the writing are all relentlessly beautiful and instructive not only that the process that bill used to create the book also is an example of the design thinking and action at its best the process and the product demonstrate why bill is known as one of the most skilled designers in the world and i mean both technically and socially skilled i had heard about the book a bit from bill as i was amazed to hear that he was with help from key people at ideo and his social network producing everything in the book himself writing all the words doing all the interviews with or so designers and innovators who are the main focus of the book everyone from doug englebart inventor of the computer mouse to google s larry page to wil wright creator of the sims to designing the layout and cover to using desktop publishing and video editing software to himself to bring it all together in fact i confess that although i have made it through the text i haven t even looked at the dvd yet that is included with the book and as i ve implied bill also produced in the name of full disclosure i am an ideo fellow and have known and admired bill for along time but i know and admire lots of people who write books on creativity and innovation this is the masterpiece in my view this book is published by mit press which has had few of any books at the top of the best seller list in its history and it is about pages longer than most books that are slated to be hit sellers but it deserves to be a best seller given the current clamoring for creativity and innovation throughout the world designing interactions only costs on amazon and it has more useful information and inspiration than any other books you are likely to buy that are vaguely related to the subject and they don t have a dvd now i have to go back to my other chores and resist the temptation to watch the dvd for another couple days it is minutes ps checkout the designing interactions website you can see video clips from the dvd there and read a sample chapter the url is http wwwdesigninginteractionscom 
practical help it s a sample of the questions you can get in the software a great tool if you can t use a laptop or pc all you have to do is turn the page and get a full explanation with references to pmbok very useful 
good i saw the film at a young age never forgot it then oops i wanted to read the book books are always different than the movie 
written with humor and respect what a fascinating approach to the great depth of tolkien s wonderful world ! i grew up reading and rereading lord of the rings his works inspired me to a great love of the histories and mythologies of great britain but it has been many years since i have had the leisure to pour over his detailed histories and indeed some of the lost and unfinished tales can be heavy reading therefore i was intrigued to find a quick reference book in the familiar dummies format and after reading through it i am pleased to find any concerns that this might trivialize tolkien s books were unfounded on the contrary mr harvey approaches these works with great knowledge and respect his observations are often informative and open more doors of ideas and learning yet all of this is presented lightly with deceptive ease and humor over all a good companion book to add to my tolkein and lewis shelf 
easily the best easily one of the best and most influential science fiction stories ever written 
trust it was the kind of action paced thriller that had me turning the pages it seemed to pick up in pace as it neared the conclusion from zurich to new york to rio gives an insight into the banking world not as clean as the swiss would like you to believe 
amazing writing funny yet touching and real this book is phenomenal darbyshire debuts with strong writing and even stronger characters best books i have read so far this year 
exceptional read this book has been around as long as i ve been alive and i have read it several times of all religious centered books that i have read i believe that the seven storey mountain brought me back into the catholic faith thomas merton was not an angel and neither were the saints thomas merton was and is a complex person if you read this auto biography you will not know the real thomas merton it would be beneficial to read his journals to get a real look into his mind and in the way he expresses the mystery of god and religous life his desire for seclusion in the monastic life was constantly being challenged by his prolific writings and his popularity in the outside world it is also interesting to note that thomas background was english litertature and not theology which is to me an enigma in that how can someone from a secular background have the knowledge base of describing his journey into the great mystery thomas was truly given the gift of the holy spirit in order to write his wonderful journey for us to follow with him i totally recommend this great book for anyone who wants to understand their own journey into the great mystery 
highly entertaining for those interested in wall street the book is a good read and entertaining for those interested in wall street this book should be required for anyone thinking of getting a job on the street some stories may be hard to understand for readers not familiar with finance terminology 
cool story in this book there really isn t one main plot there is actually a whole bunch of interesting little plots telling about events that happened during caddie woodlawn s childhood caddie woodlawn s real name was catherine and she lived on the western side of wisconsin most people called her a tomboy because she loved to swim build things and fix clocks she also hated cleaning sewing knitting and wearing formal clothing even though she was a tomboy she was also very kind one time she had a silver dollar that her uncle edmund had given her he said that it was just for her and she could spend it on anything she liked caddie ended up saving the silver dollar for a long time when she finally spent it caddie bought little candies and knickknacks that were for a few kids that had just lost their mother this is just one of the things that caddie woodlawn does at first the story seems a little dull then once you finish the book you end up thinking it was pretty good i like how the story isn t based on one plot the part i didn t like was how the story didn t stay interesting the whole book i d give this book about stars out of five 
witty alexander mccall smith s latest series introduces us to characters ranging from the egocentric bruce whose full time job consists of taking baths and admiring his looks in the mirror to irene the neurotic mother who has encouraged her young son bertie to learn italian and the saxaphone despite his protests and then there is pat the attractive college student on her nd gap year who recognizes the good in people despite falling in love with bruce albeit temporarily while i enjoyed all of the story lines and characters i found the relationship with pat and domenica her elderly neighbor most interesting given that many young people dismiss the elderly as being boring and unworthy of their time which is so often not the case as pat recognized like other reviewers the only potential downside to this book was the references to scottish politics and customs that i couldn t relate to not having lived there at the same time however that is what makes it interesting because it opened my eyes up to another world which is the whole point of books in my opinion 
what was all the fuss wonderful true story of two male penguins that adopt an unwanted baby penguin homophobes objected to a line in the book where the zoo keeper says they must be in love kids will love it and it should be in every library it is a story from which many adults can learn tolerance 
great entertainment value a cheerful look at the world of the closeted cross dresser this book describes veronica vera s approach to offering cross dressing services to men who have sufficient funds to be able to travel to her new york academy for lessons of one sort or another illustrated profusely with photos of students and staff there are chapters covering everything from attitude through body shaping and deportment to finishing touches such as makeup etiquette and outings you can follow the adventures of students like sally sissyribbons as ms vera covers studies such as home ec fashion field trips and sex education yet despite the sprightly titillating approach to cross dressing there are some very useful tips and tricks sprinkled throughout more veronica vera s philosophy and some very timely words of wisdom can be found strategically placed for the most effect for example while covering the subject of what is referred to as passing she says you can sell what you believe in so believe in your right to be your femmeself and you will be empowered in all aspects of your life although the book provides the reader with lighthearted humourous entertainment if that is what you are after i would not recommend it to the person who is seriously looking for advice or support on transgender issues 
keeps you guessing til the end in this involving and complicated story david baldacci covers everything from drug dealing to cults to the fbi to pyschoanalyis and hypnotism there s also a horse farm and pornography thrown in for good measure ! the main plot deals with the character of web london the sole survivor of a botched mission by hrt hostage rescue team a part of the fbi as he and his companions are en route to tackle a drug lord london suddenly collapses unable to continue as if paralyzed he then is forced to witness his colleagues massacre as they are shot by remote control weaponry as they enter an urban courtyard london s determination to discover what happened to him and clear his name makes up the bulk of the novel in his journey he is forced to confront childhood abuse and the possible abuse of his psychiatrist baldacci tells the story from several points of view and should be credited with creating complex and compelling characters who are both heroic and flawed on the good side this helps when the plot becomes increasingly complicated on the potentially bad side the characters are not surprisingly unhappy with their lives and there s not a happy ending for most of them the pain gets a little much at times even though the good guys win at the end the end is abrupt and leaves you wondering if you missed something worth reading just concentrate on the plot or it will get away from you 
my favorite enneagram book the enneagram isn t easily taught through reading a book but this one does the best job in both introducing the types and more importantly giving clear ways to work with the system by including core features and super ego messages it helps the seeker go a bit deeper into the types than any other of the books i read getting behind the personality into what drives and feeds it the little test at the beginning of each chapter are pretty good but i think it s better to look at the chart of the levels in each type chapter to help discover your type the chapters feature many exercises to guide the reader into self reflection other features like the red flag fears of each type are addressed helping a person notice when they are losing themselves i think this is a good book both to introduce the system and for the more knowlegeable student of the system i have used it as a source to take me deeper and deeper on personal journey and a clear way to help others understand themselves 
a good story for your young book worm i read this story as a child at the school library after seeing it on reading rainbow and enjoyed it very much now i m an adult and have collected the books i remember from my childhood for a bit of nostalgia gregory is one of them i have also collected it for my nephew it s a sweet story and easy to read perfect for any child

heroes with wood canvas steeds what a remarkable book ! there really aren t that many stories of wwi aviation that i haven t read so i was delighted to find this one on amazon it s written with marvelous attention to detail and with a great sense of authenticity often i had to pause to look up a word that has fallen out of usage these days as other reviewers have mentioned there are no knights of the air in this story just young men doing a job the best they can in fact the story s protagonist often finds himself mourning the deaths of the german airmen that fall to the british vickers machine guns my only complaint a minor one is the cover it shows an sea in a dogfight tom and his squadron fly the now famous sopwith camel altogether a great read and a book that i will re visit from time to time 
a beautifully written book talk before sleep tells the story of five friends one of whom ruth is dying of cancer her best friend ann puts her own family on hold and stays with ruth both day and night this book had particular meaning to me since i too am living with cancer the story is told in a light hearted comical manner about a subject that is far from humorous each of us could use a group of devoted friends like ruth s they make ruth s last days bearable in spite of her pain sharing past memories good times laughs tears and enough ice cream to turn them all into the size of elephants ! the ending of the book takes a twist that proves painful for the friends who stood by ruth until her last days the strengths in talk before sleep are the lessons it teaches us about living each day for the moment and enjoying the camaraderie of friendships the one weakness of the book is the fact ann left the reader feeling she had abandoned her responsibilities to her own family to be with her friend a vary noble gesture but were her priorities in the right place that is a matter of the reader s opinion overall i enjoy many of elizabeth berg s books and this one is no exception 
insightful and essential a master of his craft in propaganda edward bernays splendidly advocates the art he defines as the consistent enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of the public to an enterprise idea or group p some may recoil from his assertions that propaganda is necessary to give order to a chaotic world and that in a democracy an intelligent minority must regiment and guide the masses to clear understanding and intelligent action p as refreshing today as when he wrote eighty years ago bernays explains that contrary to what many believe propaganda is not confined to corporate advertising but is indispensable to political parties special interest groups news media and some government agencies indeed today s global warming crisis would cease to exist without it bernays declares propagandists should maintain certain principles including refusing clients believed to be dishonest products that are fraudulent and not engaging in deceit or outright lying though severely criticized for establishing the successful cigarette advertising campaigns for tobacco companies he demonstrated his integrity by dropping the companies as clients when he became convinced of the strong association between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer unfortunately many modern practitioners are not as scrupulous this concise book is compelling for those who dare to think on their own rather than being told by an elite few what to think and how to act 
great puzzle book for middle school students the puzzles in this book are wonderful to use after students have finished a test or other work it keeps them quiet so that the other students can finish their work undisturbed the puzzles are a little more challenging than the usual highlights hidden picture puzzles which makes them great for junior high age students i highly recommend this book and hope that joe boddy creates more in the future 
packed with knowledge understand from the outset what the power of six sigma is not it is not really a story about two buddies who lunch together while they pursue management success that s just the framework it is not a book on how to implement six sigma although it would prove a useful adjunct to any such program nor is it one of those books filled with consultant ese whose primary function seems to be to advertise you need to hire me to help you to dispel the confusion that my book just generated this is actually a very down toearth introduction to the quality enhancement strategy that is continuing to transform the corporate world frustrated onlookers may believe that practitioners keep the practical meaning of six sigma hidden like some secret magic potion but this powerful little book blows the lid off the caldron written as a lunchroom dialogue between friends it s as user friendly as it is insightful we highly recommend this manual to anyone at any level involved or becoming involved with six sigma

challenges many liberal myths theologically liberal protestants and theologically liberal catholics have distorted the new testament witness by pushing a false opposition between the kingdom of god and the church they have also ignored the new testament evidence for the primacy of peter as first bishop of rome and for the priesthood of the new covenant fortunately cardinal ratzinger sets the record straight by showing that there is no opposition between the kingdom preached by jesus and the church founded by the same jesus by documenting the new testament evidence for the petrine primacy and by pointing to the theology of the new covenant s own priesthood present in the new testament all of this is done concisely precisely and clearly this book should be read by any christian interested in the church and especially by catholics it is a primer on ecclesiology

king delivers another grand title or is it bachman im back from the dead and you don t seem glad to see my at all you ungrateful son of a bi ch during a time when folks began to question stephen king s story telling ability the master of horror pulls yet another ace from the deck the dark half is a strong novel similar to a short novella secret window secret garden from another sk book four past midnight however after reading the first couple hundred pages the close association with that story ends and the dark half begins this novel is a nice breath of fresh air compared to other work that king released during this time period such as the tommyknockers needful things dolores claiborne etc its unique style screams bachman and displays steve king s uncanny ability to write beyond the typical monster under the bed yarn while capitalizing on his untapped ability to write a great crime novel with a little mythology and telepathy thrown in to boot the dark half delivers a prominent yarn that will keep the reader engaged from start to finish the only major problem i had with the book was the short abrupt ending which always seems to plague most of king s work as his fans love to point out 
my top recommendation many people know of hoylebranded game rule books but this book deserves much greater recognition and acclaim in addition to presenting one of the best modern collections of game rules mohr delves into the interesting histories behind the games did you know that croquet was once banned as an immoral sport from board games to outdoor games to party games mohr clearly and entertainingly presents a delightful and diverse set of game entertainments for all ages other sources will of course present more comprehensive sets of rules for card games wwwpagatcom dice games knizias dice games properly explained and other types of games from my full shelf of game rule books this is the beautiful and balanced one i would recommend to a friend who is seeking their first 
the ultimate cliffhanger i saw the reenactment last night on inside edition of the night that natalee holloway disappeared and it was really slanted in my opinion nobody who has seen joran would identify him as being with the blonde american girl with the dutch accent the one thing about this book is that it leaves you hanging a real cliffhanger unfortunately it s for real and we don t know what happened to natalee hopefully someday soon we will find out i really enjoyed the book i only wish it had a happy ending 
good for adult sunday school as a christian for years i realized this year how little i knew about christmas traditions when i found this book i thought it was good enough to use as the basis for an adult as opposed to children sunday school class feedback has been very enthusiastic ! the book is well written and an easy and interesting read each chapter covers a different christmas tradition chapters are typically pages i highly recommend this book 
gorgeous this book is full of wonderful photos ! an excellent resource book for anyone who is interested in studying the visual richness of this medium 
she s done it again ms lindskold continues to write literate well thought out fantasy this continuation of the firekeeper and blind seer saga proves to be the best yet ms lindskold refuses to be predictable besides the wolf series she has written enough unrelated books such as child of a rainless year to prove the extent of her imagination an imagination that does not need to construct unbelievable scenarios and long descriptive passages to carry you into her world the story alone carrys you with it we are lucky indeed to have such a writer 
great theology boy did the first reviewer have a axe to grind ! longman rates this commentary five stars he states that it is a very sensitive theological reading that also brings these two books into touch with the contemporary world 
who needs a professor as a busy professional going back to school to earn that overpriced piece of paper we call a b s i had no time to bs with the generals we all learned if we were paying attention in jr high to eliminate the math requirement i picked up this book as well as the best review for the clep general exams i spent two evenings about an hour per night reviewing algebra and geometry then i spent another two nights an hour a piece with this book studying statistics of course i didn t read the entire book in two hours but i had studied enough to pass the math requirement and saved myself months of agony and several thousand dollars i highly recommend this book for anyone like me who wasn t listening much in th th th or th grade math to those who are taking their th grade classes seriously don t study too hard or you ll have nothing new to learn at university 
excellent book for those who already know programming one of the main reasons i liked this book is it didn t dumb things down too much i already know how to do basic stuff like program in c and operate a compiler so it was refreshing to find a game programming book that didn t waste a third of its pages on amateur content still if you know nothing about game programming specifically but have a strong foundation in computers and know c or can pick it up quickly this is a great book the evolution of the examples is well done leading you from simple d vectors a la pong all the way up to platform scrollers with sprites and sound effects some would find it silly to have a game programming book these days that covers absolutely no d programming but this book is still very relevant i think the topics covered are crucial for anyone learning game development and specifically if you re interested in working on mobile handheld or internet games where d is still the norm this book is excellent for that there were also very few errors in the text remarkable for a book of its size with so many code listings 
excellent perspective on miami i read this book so many years ago but i just now realized i had never shared my opnions about it i had lived in miami for about eight years and i think i was in my th year or so when i finally heard about quotmiamiquot by joan didion it was only after i had finally moved to the beach that i happened upon it at kafka s at any rate it is an excellent book i think about it every time i hear on the news about the bumbling cia or news of castro makes the nytimes incidentally also saw the publication of quotthe corpse had a familiar face quot by edna buchanan another equally excellent non fiction book about this city i also highly recommend quota book of common prayer quot by ms didion 
awesome without question the very best book i ever read you can not but it down nor can you stop thinking about it this is a powerful book you will be moved and your foundation shaken but your life will be richer this is a must read 
an innovative alphabet book although a big fan of lisa campbell ernst s previous books this book sets a new standard for excellence in children s books the innovative style she presents in this alphabet book is intriguing for both children and adults while reading this book aloud to young neighbors they soon learned the fun of using their imagination to determine what each letter might be if turned on its side or upside down this book is a delight for all ages 
oh mother moms have a way of embarrassing us they don t mean it of course they just do it accidentally in public places and from what i ve heard they still do it long after you ve moved out and started your own family but we all still love them savannah from savannah is alarmed to hear that her mother has chained herself to the monument of the commandments outside of the courthouse she can t believe that her beauty queen mother who always has to look perfect is willing to sit outside in public in the same clothes for days thus savannah tries to distance herself away from her mother dealing instead with a homeless lady who keeps asking her for food a beauty queen killing her boyfriend and a new female reporter who s caught the eye of every guy in town eventually savannah comes to realize her mother s stance and respects her i liked how this story had savannah come to better terms with her mother in the first book the reader is shown how the two are completely different this story had savannah finally understanding her mom standing up for her and learning to be proud of her i found the scenes with amber funny as usual between her rehearsed speech on ronald reagan and her chasing and beating up the purse snatcher i was in stitches the scenes with the picnic with grant was touching because it s hard to when someone you love has moved on with another i was also relived that savannah has decided to cut back on the coke it s a wonder that she doesn t suffer from caffeine overdose or stained teeth id recommend this book for anyone who likes chick lit mother daughter stories or southern culture

if you read one book this year make it lonesome dove like many of the other reviewers here have already stated this is a book to be read by everyone ! i am not a reader of westerns but i loved this book after pages i was never so sad to see a book end lonesome dove has a little of everything drama action humor and a few love stories to boot there are few books that have made me laugh or cry like this book did by the time your are done you will have new friends woodrow pea eye claire lorena but especially gus mccrea and you will also have some new villains particularly the frightening blue duck i can t recommend a book any more than this one 
important book this important book is so well written that despite its broad sweep and intellectual distinction it flows beautifully the first chapters provide one of the simplest and clearest descriptions of cosmology i ve ever read perhaps even bettter than neil degrasse tyson s in natural history christian provides a marvellous theoretical framework for understanding history as playing out repetitive patterns and the sweep of learning while careful is extraordinary 
just like the originals i just got this book in the mail today and i love it already the pages are nice sized and the books are sturdy enough for years of enjoyment these are the stories i remember my mother reading me as a child and i look forward to many hours of reading to my own children if they don t get worn out from lots of use they will be passed on to the next generation as well just as our childhood books have been these are classic stories that will be loved for many generations

an extraordinary book from an extraordinary artist this book is fantastic as far as photo books go there is a important quality attached to having good reproductions in a printed book the bone house has some of the best reproductions of the original prints availiable aside from appropriate information about the author and artist himself 
be a wise man or woman larry has produced an easily affordable primer on project management much better edited than his artech house textbook this one is very suitable for handing out to every member of the project management team for their use in understanding the road ahead along the way larry throws in the benefit of his and other s experience to help avoid making the same mistakes as eli goldratt just said the difference between a smart man and a wise man is that the smart man learns from his mistakes the wise man learns from the smart man s mistakes you can be wise by buying this book 
frank and honest style for those searching for the truth must read especially for nd generation christians or youngsters searching for god for themselves the style is frank and easy you ll come away knowing god better i happen to come across this book quotby chance quot now i am reading all other books by isobel kuhn 
don t leave home without it indispensable i plowed through gr in my mid twenties without the companion large portions of pynchon s encyclopedic epic were totally baffling to me however i ve always been intrigued by gr so some fifteen years later i undertook to read it again this time with the help of the companion not only did it aid in my understanding of the novel but i actually enjoyed reading gr this time around now perhaps i ll tackle mason amp dixon 
excellent research grounded in sound principles and beautiful thoughts i decided i liked judith lasater after reading her articles in yoga journal she explained in one article the pathological process of sciatica nerve pain in very concrete medical and scientific terms enabling me to understand it completely and therefore help myself and bring this very common problem under control yoga journal also recommended this book living your yoga as another good read for her so i purchased it like many of us wanting to know how to bring this beautiful practice of yoga that we love sooo much into our everyday lives i could not put this book down fellow readers what i found was sometimes overwhelming especially since most of us in western society are taught to think from the neck up and not from our hearts some of it could only be assimilated by much contemplation like the statement that all of us humans have our reality defined by our beliefs and practices reading the chapter on suffering that was a tough one especially since i see so much of it in nursing and it is difficult to cultivate detachment in other ways this book is almost like a workbook giving practices for the reader to participate in and mantras to chant at the end of each chapter then there is the last chapter on love well i wont spoil the surprise but i am sure that no one will be disappointed ! 
supremely soulful pretty much an autodidact at poetry thus having utterly no pretense to credentials with which to browbeat those with different views i ve come to regard emily as one of the very best poets of all time and among other things one of the very best of christian theologians notwithstanding what various far better credentialed experts have pronounced to the contrary emily was indeed a christian though quite solitary mystical and hardly conventional take for example j not that we did shall be the testwhen act and will are donebut what our lord infers we wouldhad we diviner been is this not an exquisite and ultra polysemic four line sermon on discipleship grace incarnation and judgment salvationvery few have written of the soul as profoundly beautifully and economically as emily plato would have marvelled at this girl whoever first referred to her as a nun described her much better than many moderns who seem preoccupied with her secret loves and lovers sexual preferences etc see no for example to decode emily i bought the noah webster american english dictionary it along with the bible the poetry of george herbert and the classical writers and philosophers are for me essential to filling in the various matrices of meaning that are her poems even then many poems remain obscure and one must fortuitously discover tidbits from history then current events etc to occasionally render them comprehensible understanding emily could take a lifetime of work and pleasure this edition is great because it is essentially faithful to how emily actually recorded her poems with her as everyone knows the seemingly eccentric punctuation capital letters and other quirks are significant 
lyrical i really enjoyed greer s most recent novel the confessions of max tivoli so i thought i d pick this previous collection of writings after the fact some of the stories in my opinion hit me deep inside i felt like many of the characters and greer did a nice job of putting me into the perspective other stories however were simply confusing and over wordedoverall a wonderful read i truly wish there were more stories oh well on to path of minor planets i guess 
mostly true except for the information from mcnamara people were looking for a book that could grab them about nam when this was a best seller in and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in nam itself as a primary consideration portions of this book originally appeared in the new yorker so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared frances fitzgerald s original trip to vietnam was in february to november of and resulted in articles for the atlantic monthly the village voice vogue etc people who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like nam where large numbers of young americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion this book is not perfect the only listing for tonkin gulf resolution in the index is for the page on which president johnson s use of the resolution is questioned by senator fulbright in that was the time this book is mainly concerned with but it gives an enormous amount of background information it is possible to find a listing in the index under gvn for and u s entry into the war which gives the page that reflects secretary of defense robert mcnamara s testimony to congress that it was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by gvn forces that north vietnamese pt boats attacked the u s destroyer maddox mistaking it for one of the south vietnamese vessels pp actually the oplan a attacks along the gulf of tonkin coastline were operations planned and approved in washington d c and mcnamara lied about south vietnamese operations to maintain the secret status of u s operations during which the north vietnamese pt boats were responding to recoilless rifle fire from a small boat when american intelligence informed the maddox that it was about to be attacked radio intercepts of north vietnamese naval messages on august were used to convince lbj and senators that an attack had occurred when two american destroyers were picking up radar ghosts and sonar readings off the reflection of a hard turned rudder as shown by subsequent tests edwin e moise s book tonkin gulf and the escalation of the vietnam war has much more information about that secret circus stunt jeffrey kimball s recent book the vietnam war files uncovering the secret history of nixon era strategy contains a reference to the author of this book in a memorandum by dwight chapin to haldeman january about a month after heavy bombing near or in hanoi to get some ceasefire agreement signed hoping it could be called the peace announcement p and attempting to describe a point of view different from what intellectuals were expecting the fitzgeralds and the fondas the halberstams and harrimans the clarks and ellsbergs and baezes are poised in the wings just waiting to treat the end of the war as their victory and to so opine from coast to coast kimball p i have the first vintage books edition august which was after dwight chapin s memorandum but i am not sure if american bombing in cambodia had ended when the actual paper in this book was printed on there are only six lines of listings in the index for cambodia mostly on general issues but the week i spent there was hardly earth shaking of more interest to me was the report in fire in the lake about the an lao valley where the battalion th infantry from the th infantry division spent the months from september to january i believe this was our first free fire zone with a base high above a village that had been destroyed surrounded by paddies in which elephant grass was growing instead of rice but enemy soldiers were found harvesting highland rice on the hillsides enemy contact was the only kind we had after all other possibilities had been eliminated in the manner described in this book in operation masher white wing alone a multi regimental sweep through the north of binh dinh province the allied forces by the estimates destroyed an entire enemy division in the process they left hundreds of civilians dead and wounded and generated so many refugees as almost to depopulate the fertile an loa valley p while the american troops opened roads and cleared great stretches of territory the front guerrillas came back into every area except those heavily garrisoned by u s troops by the end of the nlf continued to govern the an lao valley as well as the suburbs of da nang hue nha trang and saigon p there is only one line in the index for frantz fanon but anyone who is interested in how fitzgerald saw a link between revolution against colonial powers in african and arab countries and the situation in nam including the belief in fate and the symbolic killing of self which he called the behavior patterns of avoidance the sudden crime waves that spread through the cities the tribal warfare and the fierce irrational feuding of the native sects as he explained them p you wouldn t want to believe how true the stuff in this book could be today 
great for high school teachers this book is excellent as a source for explaining concepts there are lots of tutorial books for teaching html and specific software programs to generate the code but they don t guarantee because a website works logistically on a server it works for the intended audience

thorough history of mary as a protestant convert to orthodox christianity i had the usual misgivings regarding the elevated role of mary in the orthodox and catholic churches this book gives a thorough and scholarly approach to how marionology developed over the centuries in both the eastern and western traditions of the church it was very helpful in enabling me to better appreciate why there is such a veneration of mary even though there is not much biblical revelation about her the most surprising thing to me was the muslim connection to mary this book will certainly fill in your knowledge and appreciation for mary and how she developed into such an icon of the church

an enjoyable and charming read that has earned its place among the classics when professor von hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the earth is possible he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward harry into an expedition first to iceland and then into the earth harry a young man sees no good that can come of this expedition but dutifully agrees so begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published jules verne s a journey to the center of the earth i m hardly a verne expert but i ve read many of his other classics journey is unique among his work it s one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of harry moreover unlike his other books journey is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic verne through his various characters slyly implores his readers indulgence reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don t know verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters from leagues under the seas on verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists the brilliant and calm professor the professor s loyal apprentice and the non scientific cantankerous pragmatic but steadfast man of action here verne mixes and matches these traits making for a more interesting cast hardwigg is a brilliant scientist but he s also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy demanding his fellow travelers press on perhaps beyond all reason the man of action the icelandic hans is loyal but by no means cantankerous he simply does what must be done and is unsteady in his loyalty finally harry rather than the unquestioning apprentice is quite skeptical of this expedition hardly steadfast he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times thus with these interesting characters in the mix the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable while the premise is fantastic the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic albeit more mundane threats of natural disaster rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave men our heroes must deal with being lost the threat of starvation underground lakes exhaustion and exposure naturally just as all hope seems lost for our heroes fortune takes a hand obviously if harry is narrating they probably get out okay still there are some moments of true white knuckle tension as harry is lost in the caverns or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food supplywisely verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here he s less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery and concentrates instead on a great rip roaring read admittedly the conventions of victorian era fiction don t always allow the book to rip or roar the first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting harry and the professor to iceland and recruiting an expedition it s more of a travelogue than an adventure tale which makes the book more realistic although not consistently exciting once our heroes are underground however the book takes off in the grand scheme of things a journey to the center of the earth is probably not my favorite verne book it lacks a remarkable character like captain nemo it also lacks some of the sharper satire verne brought to his other books like from the earth to the moon it doesn t quite have the pacing of around the world in days nonetheless it is an enjoyable and charming read and certainly has earned its place among the classics 
phenomenal work which will challenge sophisticated readers cristina peri rossi s work is thought provoking treatise on exile and isolation whose metaphor resonated with me the language is sophisticated and engaging while at the same time evocative of the sparseness and detachedness at the novel s core this is an impressive work which has established the author as an important new voice not only for those interested in latin american literature or women authors but for anyone interested in perspectives which push the envelope of the literary canon if you are interested in being challenged read this boo 
solid parker while the reviews on this book go from one to five it would appear the ones don t understand why anyone would like this book and the fives can t get enough spenser as someone said this is a dumb book and not like the serious other mystery writers true and that s why some of us read spenser he s our man if we re ready for wisecracking fast paced action with little need to get cerebral as a mystery reader first and other genre next i find that parker usually gives me a break from the heavy writers like wilson or kerr in fact that s the whole point after reading a couple of robert wilson s books i need to cleanse my palate with something that goes down easy makes me laugh maybe it s a little too watery but there s no calories and i can finish it quickly and feel refreshed if you don t like spenser and his wisecracks you re bereft of understanding the use of this type of dialogue in this type of story so i d advise you to go back to your old favs and let the rest of us enjoy the comedy with a little mystery thrown in for cause or is it the other way around i agree that we d like our pis to be solitary and spenser should be since he can t seem to clearly concentrate when there are boobs in the room and so many women in parker s books appear flawless we know this is in parker s head cuz real life ain t that way ! but we re taking a break from real life with spenser so we forgive a lot of shallowness and superficiality we can t eat steak all the time without growing tried of it so keep the juicy cheesy burgers coming parker i like the change up 
wow this book is incredible ! great read for anyone who is interested in truth 
among merton s finest books i commend new directions for issuing a facsimile reprint of the original of this valuable book who would not say that here is a publishing company of enduring and impeccable taste i have a copy of the original cloth bound book it is beautiful and easily one of my top twenty favorite books i believe this is the book that comes most surely from merton the poet his consideration of the psalms is inspired the language in this book is as severe and ecstatic as are the psalms themselves and his insight into their relevance is without peer the brevity of merton s exposition is part of its potency nothing is wasted like the psalms themselves the veins of this book run deep in kingly rivers announcing the heart of god like a morning song merton s interior acquisition of that song is of epic intensity yet simple as clean water i believe quotbread in the wilderness quot surpasses even quotseeds of contemplation quot in directness common heart and indeed artistic beauty it s an indescribably beautiful book that moves aches and rocks and leads one ultimately to the inmost core of revelation which is after all believability merton s references to the psalms can be traced like a monk s thread throughout all of his writing from the earliest books up through the posthumously published journals this book gives us a clear understanding of how constantly faithful thomas merton remained not only to the brilliant song of the psalms themselves but to the music of his own exceeding heart and the woodcut christ on the cover is so unfailingly cistercian ! this is a book that will live forever 
scholarly work this was the second book i read on the civil war following james mcpherson s excellent battle cry of freedom i was led to read it because of my interest in the strange reversal of fortune of the republican party amongst african americans why did the party of lincoln and more importantly the radicals gain less than of the black vote in actually this book doesn t really answer that question what it does explore in some detail is the origins of the republican party that is why i have referred to it as a scholarly work the quality of foner s research is formidable and together with william geinapp s similar book provide a indispensable guide not just to the historical events but as the title suggests to the underlying ideology that tied some very diverse politicians together furthermore in a key chapter the republican critique of the south foner analyses the root of those beliefs 
bam that s how i feel a must for those in the depths of life s hell i began what i believe to be my mid life crisis a few months ago a dear friend gave me his copy of this book and it now travels with me everywhere i have referred back to my highlights on several occasions and the best thing is becoming aware that our experiences are a part of a much larger journey there are pieces within the text that i had to reread several times but the overall message was clear and i never felt overwhelmed by the effort to find the meaning or relation of a certain passage hollis is on my a list of respected authors i even had him recommend my current therapist

a great book for cat lovers and also cat haters if your cat has annoying or endearing behaviors then you may see some of them in this great book the simple folk art illustrations of a cat giving you a butt salute or of drinking from a toilet perrier anyone or of covering your head while you are trying to sleep will make you laugh out loud a great gift for anyone with a cat i particularly liked the page with the cat knocking off christmas tree ornaments which happened in our house one year i have never had one gnaw on my toes but i always kept them covered around my cat 
good considering the time harvey is a totally spoiled boy it starts when harvey is on a ship with his mother i forget where they are going he is washed overboard and saved by a fisherman manuel on the fishing boat harvey makes his first friend learns to work for his keep and so on the story worked it wasn t cheesy maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type but the plot of harvey growing up seemed just to be there so you will read the book the characters were well developed except the cook you never really figure out where he is coming from most of the book was about fishing of the grand banks very interesting is you like fishing and ships but if you are reading it for the story there is not that much the ending was also weak we are happy the harvey is reconciled but i really think that his parents would make a bigger stink good historical value kipling is a very enjoyable writer yes i liked it but the plot had some flaws i do recommend it though 
lending and losing this book should have taught me a lesson having read portrait of an artist in college i learned to appreciate the talent determination and self reliance that success requires it should be required reading for every young woma 
good for christmas serious or fun this has almost all the songs and carols you could want both sacred and secular plus some extras i ve never heard of not many luckily great for a party and also for a quiet evening with friends or family it s missing biggies in my opinion white christmas and winter wonderland copyright problems maybe otherwise it has a lot from o holy night and birthday of a king to silly ones like the chipmunk song i still want a hu la ho oopand grandma got run over by a reindeer i really enjoyed it last christmas it was great for a sing along too one tip play through some songs yourself before you play for a group occasinally you might prefer different harmony ie different chords than those given it doesn t happen often when it does just cross out the printed chord and write in the one you like better i think we re all used to certain harmonies when it comes to something like christmas songs and carols i had fun with this book at christmas as you can tell i think it ll be a regular for me in future christmas seasons 
the foreword to this book there are two ways to learn more about your country you can study it directly by travelling around in it or you can study it indirectly by leaving it the first method yields facts and insights directly in context and the second by contrast our tradition in computer engineering has been to seldom leave our neighborhood if you want to learn about operating systems you read an os book for multiprocessor systems you get a book that maps out the mp space the book you are holding in your hands can serve admirably in that direct sense if the technology you are working on is associated with vliws or embedded computing then clearly it is imperative that you read this book but what pleasantly surprised me was how useful this book is even if one s work is not vliw related or has no obvious relationship to embedded computing i had long felt it was time for josh fisher to write his magnum opus on vliws so when i first heard he and his co authors were working on a book with vliw in the title i naturally and enthusiastically assumed this was it then i heard the words embedded computing were also in the title and felt considerable uncertainty having spent most of my professional career in the general purpose computing arena i thought embedded computing was interesting but mostly in the same sense that studying cosmology was interesting intellectually challenging but what does it have to do with me i should have known better i don t think josh fisher can write boring text he doesn t know how i still consider his very long instruction word architectures and the eli paper from isca to be the finest conference publication i have ever read and he seems to have either found like minded co authors in faraboschi and young or he taught them well because embedded computing a vliw approach is enthralling in its clarity and exhilarating in its scope if you are involved in computer system design or programming you must still read this book because it will take you to places where the views are spectacular including those looking over to where you usually live you don t necessarily have to agree with every point the authors make but you will understand what they are trying to say and they will make you think one of the best legacies of the classic hennessy and patterson computer architecture textbooks is that the success of their format and style has encouraged more books like theirs in embedded computing a vliw approach you will find the pitfalls controversies and occasional opinion sidebars that made h p such a joy to read this kind of technical exposition is like vulcanology done while standing on an active volcano look over there and see molten lava running under a new fissure in the rocks feel the heat it commands your full attention it s immersive it s interesting and it s immediate if your vibram soles start melting it s still worth it you probably needed new shoes anyway i first met josh when i was a grad student at carnegie mellon in he spent an hour earnestly describing to me how a sufficiently talented compiler could in principle find enough parallelism via a technique he called trace scheduling to keep a really wild looking hardware engine busy the compiler would speculatively move code all over the place and then invent more code to fix up what it got wrong i thought to myself so this is what a lunatic looks like up close i hope he s not dangerous two years later i joined him at multiflow and learned more in the next five years than i ever have before or since it was an honor to review an early draft of this book and i was thrilled to be asked to contribute this foreword as the book makes clear general purpose computing has traditionally gotten the glory while embedded computing quietly keeps our infrastructure running this is probably just a sign of the immaturity of the general purpose computing environment even though we non embedded types don t like to admit that with general purpose computers people use the computer to do something but with embedded computers people accomplish some task blithely and happily unaware that there s a computer involved indeed if they had to be conscious of the computer their embedded computers would have already failed antilock brakes and engine controllers for instance general purpose cpus have a few microarchitecture performance tricks to show their embedded brethren but the embedded space has much more to teach the general computing folks about the bigger picture total cost of ownership who lives in the adjacent neighborhoods and what they need for all to live harmoniously this book is a wonderful contribution towards that evolution 
understanding is a first step and almost half way if you are a man and you are deeply suffering because either you are in love or because you feel you are loosing one this book is worth a hundred psycho therapy sessions it is very likely that it will help you to understand yourself and therefore you would become much more likely to take control or at least to feel wide relief associated to deep understanding

informative and insightful read this is a thought provoking book about self injury and healing the book is well written and very descriptive many narratives are used in the text and this helps to create a greater understanding of individual experiences and struggles this is important because each of us experiences things in our own way that perception then becomes reality for us once that happens we find ways to deal with the emotional intensity that this can create for many the coping mechanism of choice is self injury self injury is very difficult for many people to understand even those who self mutilate often come to treatment without a real understanding of why they harm themselves once you understand the chain of events you can start to better understand the compulsive nature of this behavior the way in which the self injurer sees self harm as the only alternative the only way to obtain some relief from the present experience one caveat i disagree with the authors depiction of self mutilation as not a manifestation of addiction in my work with patients who self injure it has become very clear to me that this behavior feels very compulsive and can become habitual also in line with the aa model of treating addiction patients most often do better when they recognize the power that self injury has over them and start to explore the origins of their psychological pain in an attempt to stop expressing this pain through self harm information on the safe alternatives program is also very helpful statistics regarding success and healing are very encouraging and these authors clearly have a good thing going another excellent read is marilee strong s book a bright red scream self mutilation and the language of pain 
another generation to add to the fun in this book we are treated to another generation of emerson and even though they are all under six they do add to the story and give us all something to look forward to in upcoming books i also recommend that this book should be read in order so many of the things that happen in each book are dependent on things that happened in previous books this is another great adventure that is set in amelia s beautiful luxor even though the great war is over it doesn t mean that the emersons are in less danger danger always seems to find them in the guise of tomb robbers murderers and other nefarious characters i won t say anymore you will need to read this wonderful series for yourself but be prepared for an exciting journey when you first begin your journey with the beloved emersons

good cop murder story the body of a beautiful woman is found floating in boston harbor with the heart surgically removed at first glance it seems that a serial killer christened jack by the press has struck again but lawyer scott finn and police detective linda flaherty are not so sure what they can be sure of is that someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make it seem to be connected to the previous killings the murdered woman was an old lover of scott s which is why he s taking a personal interest with his involvement increasing until he becomes a suspect in the case with incriminating clues left at his apartment this is an intriguing story with connections to the underworld huge business interests and lawyers looking to line their own pockets at everyone else s expense rather than the modern take on crime with intricate psychological motives this has a lot of good old fashioned biffo as was present in mickey spillane books and those of that genre and i found it to be a very good read

a must read this work sheds new light on a very fascinating question in fact this book is the basis for some of my own research within the field i highly reccommend this book from both an academic and sports fan s viewpoint 
long time absolute favorite and a true gem on imagination and execution i ve been working with this book with children for many years and have just bought my fifth copy as they seem to disappear whenever i loan them to children to take home i suspect they love them too much to part with them for good the idea of reality being what we re used to it being not rather what it has to be everywhere as well as the hilarity of the situation the people of the story are faced with is just delightful it is an excellent resource of rich vocabulary and expression and the drawings are believable and at the same time jaw dropping highly recommended to all ages especially preschool through the lower grades 
good introduction i can t help feeling that this book was written in a hurry whilst i enjoyed reading it i thought that the illustrations of which there were many were poor and quite artificial some of the areas of palm reading were beiefly glimpsed over it seems very disjointed and the layout of each of the marks and areas of the hand could look more classified while most of it is in here there must be better than this 
one has to take sides here is a remarkably subtle and slowly simmering novel about if i may resort to a clich  love and war the story takes place in the war torn vietnam of the s when the french colonialists were brutally trying to hold on to their failing system of subjugation and the americans were just beginning to get involved in tandem with this mostly forgotten but ominous period of history we get a forlorn love triangle involving an upwardly mobile young vietnamese woman a middle aged british journalist who is mentally exhausted from the war and a na ve young american operative who knows nothing about the true misguided horrors of his idealism both the love triangle and the surrounding carnage of war are used to great effect by graham greene as he slowly lays out subversive and hard hitting ruminations on the difficulties of complex human relationships and the soul crushing horrors and futility of war these realizations are mostly from the tired and cynical mind of fowler the british journalist a very well drawn character who finds it impossible to maintain his attempted neutrality in both the romantic and political struggles around him this novel is a quiet masterpiece that subversively explores how the political and the personal can affect real people doomsdayer 
if you have heard the words its malignant buy this book fast when a woman hears the words you have breast cancer the next thing that should happen is that someone hands her a copy of this book i bought this beautifully inspirational book as soon as i was diagnosed with breast cancer before i ever started learning about the disease or the treatments i needed to hear from women who had survived and that is what this book is all about my first question when i was diagnosed was am i going to die uplift was the best medicine for me in the early days of diagnosis i read every page within two days of my diagnosis and only then was i able to face the challenge ahead of me the stories of strength and courage infused me with a passion and energy to survive at a time when all i could see was darkness this book is priceless if you buy one inspirational book about dealing with breast cancer make sure this is it whether it s for yourself or for someone you know who has just been told its malignant

any parent would find this inspiring i admit it i am in love with john holt i realize that he s deceased and i am happily married but it s ok because my husband is falling in love with him too we are both sad that we didn t get an opportunity to hear him speak when he was alive thank god he wrote so many books we started by reading how children learn and then moved on to how children fail at which point we decided to read everything this man has ever written we re working on it learning all the time is a fascinating book in it john holt a former schoolteacher and eventual homeschooling advocate discusses how kids learn and how adults relate to them most of us adults don t give kids enough credit for how much they want to learn and how much they can learn at earlier ages than we would have dreamed possible he challenges everything we ve been taught about the allegedly short attention span of very young children and since we have the privilege of observing such children in our home on a daily basis we can see that he is right his philosophy involves making interesting learning materials available to kids and avoiding the two extremes of a frustrating them by pushing them into areas where they don t have aptitude or interest and b limiting them by underestimating just how much they can learn and how fast basically he really likes children and respects them as human beings john holt was trained as and worked as a teacher in the s and s the more time he spent in the classroom the more he came to believe that traditional methods of teaching were wasting a lot of children s potential and failing to keep their attention he has a tremendous respect for children he has a lot of insight into the fact that many adults don t understand respect or quite frankly even like children we have applied his philosophy with our own young children with delightful results for example neither of us are fluent in spanish but my two yearold and i are learning it together i resist the urge to play teacher in favor of learning alongside my child and i am amazed at how much she is able to learn and retain we have also used his approach towards potty training when we resisted pushing our daughter took ownership of the process sooner than we would have thought she would she announced to us that she was a big girl and didn t want to wear diapers a few weeks later we expected that it would be many months she announced that she would not be wearing diapers at night either she has been true to her word ! these are just small examples of how we have asked ourselves with a little irony but in a mostly serious fashion what would john holt do generally the answer is to be real with our kids offer as many learning opportunities as we reasonably can and pay attention to what they are learning and marvel at them in the book he gives concrete examples of kids who could easily have been considered failures in a cookie cutter classroom situation in holt s opinion even many kids who are considered learning disabled would do just fine or at least much better if they were allowed to reach their potential without an excess of testing and time wasting learning activities holts writing has influenced us to seriously consider homeschooling our children even if we don t i think that our parenting is being enriched by his approach and i would recommend this book to any parent or educator

a moving first novel sturgeon was always very much a humane writer this shows in this his first novel even thought it s not listed as a juvenile it pretty much comes across as one the hero is a little boy with abusive step parents he even gets his hand maimed he ends up on the streets where he joins a carnival with a circus sideshow toss in two jewels from space with an intelligence that can t be understood by humans and now sturgeon s dickensesque novel turns into science fiction not perfect by any means but it s always been my favorite sturgeon novel

excellent way to learn american history i am a foreign student and this is the first time that i study american history the seagull edition of this book is great because it has all the written information and appendix from the regular volume and it costed less than half some people might miss the colored pictures the maps or the extra margens to right notes but this edition fitted my budget and i am enjoying it anyway regarding the content the information is presented clearly and very complete 
great novel i am a late comer to the v i warshawski series i d known about for years but after seeing the dreadful kathleen turner movie version i decided to skip the books stupid me ! i ve only read this first book but i have to say i m hooked the character of v i warshawski is probably one of the best female p i characters out there sara paretsky has written strong three dimensional female that you can easily become attached to the plot of this first book was a little choppy but the author s understanding of chicago the lay of the land the police the politics makes up for any shortcomings bravo job ! i look forward to reading the entire series

what the book really says in the review buyer beware ! raw meat kills reviewer shani most likely has not read this book as what kliment says is not to drink raw milk rather to look for organic milk that has been safely pasteurized with different techniques to retain important enzymes she writes milk raw p it was common for physicians in the early part of the twentieth century to use raw milk and butter made from raw milk for therapeutic purposes federal and state laws requiring pasteurization of dairy products however make raw milk almost impossible to come by most agribusiness dairies heat their milk to degrees louis pasteur discovered that milk heated to degrees for one half hour was enough to kill bacteria the purpose of boiling the milk at degrees is not to keep the public safe from bacteria that causes disease but to extend the shelf life of the product i buy a brand of organic milk called organic life that hasn t been heated to such a high temperture that all the enzymes have been destroyed and will spoil in two days if not used a brand of milk that seems to last forever in the refrigerator even if it is labeled organic should be avoided kliment addresses other raw foods meat eggs in the same safe and insightful manner as she discusses milk even an improperly balanced vegetarian diet can potentially lead to degenerative diseases and kliment discusses those diets as well providing many safe and effective dietary plans there are so many different dietary recommendations in this book that if one doesn t suit your style then there are others that are equally effective berthe gerard

great go to book i originally got this book when i first moved out on my own i had some cooking experience which i gleaned from my mother but with a limited spread of recipes and without much on myown experience this book helped me a great deal as a beginner cook and taught me most of the basics years later i m a much better cook and though i rarely use this book s recipes at face value i often reference it for a guideline to dishes that i enjoy while adding my own touches also when i m preparing to try something new this is generally the first book i go to even after all this time other cook books have come and gone but this one has staying power for me earning it its five stars a great purchase for a young adult or even an every day cook who just isn t very good or who has a limited array of recipes it is also a great reference for anyone who just wants a base to branch out from 
accepting the grief after a tsunami i read this book many years ago and have been waiting for the right moment to read it to my child this week while we are absorbing the tsunami in south asia i deemed the moment right the story is set in japan at some time in the past when the farmers and fishermen in the community are following the paths their fathers and grandfathers set we see the story through the eyes of kino who lives on a mountain farm and learns about the sea through his friendship with jiya who lives in the last house in the row of houses toward the ocean and whose house does not have a window toward the sea because as jiya tells kino the sea is our enemy kino is relieved that he does not live near the sea but his father reminds him of the great volcano twenty miles away and tells him that they must learn to live with danger the storyline is simple almost inevitable a volcano erupts under the sea and causes a tsunami which sweeps away the fishing village by the sea many lives are lost as the survivors slowly recover and kino s friend jiya starts to accept life again kino asks his father all the questions that children need to ask after a natural disaster his father s answers each question with patience and wisdom in a manner open ended enough so that the reader or reader and parent can pause and talk about their own beliefs and feelings or the reader can turn the page and stay absorbed in this well crafted story my only disappointment with my paperback edition harpercollins isbn is that it left out the famous woodblock prints by the th century japanese artists hokusai and hiroshige i pored over these illustrations as a child and immediately recognized them when i saw them in my library copy pearl buck selected each individual print to allow her readers to see the beauty of japan and they form an integral part of the story i would recommend you buy the library binding version by harpercollins isbn or check out a book with illustrations from your library 
a practical book of nlp techniques if i am being selfish like my past i would not have written this review to let you know that this is such a great book for personal change i changed instantly after following a couple of the exercises explained in the book after going through the exercise of quotfast phobia method quot and quotrecoding past unpleasant experiences quot it helped me to regain much of my self confidence back which was results of an unpleasant past the book would not be an easy read for non nlpers but the authors did try very hard to explain the quothowsquot and quotwhysquot of the exercises introduced in the book more importantly they picked those essential nlp techniques for life change which makes the book invaluable although this is an nlp book from the eighties imho it sheds more lights than many of the more contemporary ones i fully recommend this book if you want to use nlp to improve yourself my advice is to work through those exercises that fit you and reflect on the resulted changes 
written by a true hardcore warrior who knew what the hell he was writting about this is probally the only book other than his battle axe book where that you can find real case studies on what strikes and techniques work under real attacks he details the various blows that were used sucessfully leopard palm blows half fist ax hands eagle claws eye attacks to name a few he also tells where the stikes landed and whatthe skels reaction was his system is one based on simplicity power and attitude he also includes his famous tiger movement exercises which if practiced will build tremendous tendon and ligiment strength get whatever reading or video material you can on this man for he is without a doubt a true sob that you can learn valuable info that is not available elsewhere where others talk theory he talks reality i am not and have never studied kempo but feel that this books should get the recognition that it deserves you will not find any fancy flashy ballet type moves they more or less resemble the ww combatives of the old school that were true and time tested fairbairnapplegateoneilstyersso the next time some pseudo tough guy claims that those chops and leopard paw strike would never work you ll know other wise and smile inside unfortunately you wont find any dim mak pressure points or no touch chi knock outs just hardcore bone crunching workable blows to be kind to you ememy is to be crule to yourself

home is where the hurt is tom bissell is fond of sprinkling aphorisms throughout the stories in this fine collection so let s lay one on him only a young man with his entire life stretched out before him could afford to be so pessimistic about life s possibilities granted he s writing about places it s easy to be pessimistic about god forsaken central asian republics spawned by the collapse of the soviet empire places that are a combo of soviet paranoia and muslim xenophobia as one character puts it five of the collection s six stories follow this pattern take a young american drop him or her into a central asian country stir chronicle the resulting disaster the first story death defier is probably the best a free lance american photographer gets caught in a difficult situation in afghanistan while trying to help a british reporter felled by a virulent strain of malaria the story poses an interesting question can you dive so deeply into the mechanics and aesthetics of war that you become immune to death terror bissell grapples honorably with the complex sensibility of war correspondents people who are voyeuristic and deeply engaged often at the same time aral is about amanda an american biologist sent by the united nations to study the shrinking aral sea a hall of fame ecological screw up amanda consistently misreads the intent of the people around her she displays that combustible american mix of idealism aggressiveness and ignorance of the local culture that s served us so well in vietnam and iraq expensive trips nowhere and the ambassador s son are ugly american stories in an author s note bissell acknowledges his debt to hemingway s the short happy life of francis macomber for expensive trips nowhere which is about courage or the lack thereof on the steppes of kazakhstan the ambassador s son is about what you d get if you dropped the jay mcinerney of bright lights big city into the capital of tashkent it should be noted that bissell writes well about sex giving it neither more nor less significance than the situation he s describing merits the final story animals in our lives is the only one set in america franklin a recently returned expat english teacher and elizabeth a med student spend an afternoon at the zoo and experience the moment when it comes clear they don t have a future with each other it s a sensitive rendering of the kinds of pain your intellect can t protect you from the title story which won a pushcart prize is about timothy a missionary in samarkand whose faith gets subverted by physical urges bissell gets the succumbing to temptation part just right along with the heartbreaking juxtaposition of sex with hope that pervades the world s downtrodden places what s missing is a visceral sense of the struggle to hold on to god god may not live in st petersburg but dostoievksi did and the master understood that sin gains heft through the hubris of the sinner something enormous was at stake for dostoievski s spiritual criminals they pitched themselves willingly on to the pyre inviting and accepting oblivion for their defiance timothy settles for the tiny oblivion of orgasm then sits in a fug of post coital remorse waiting for god to ring him up he s simply not a big enough person to carry his part of the argument so the story falls short of the tragic dimension it tries to achieve theres a lot to like about bissell as a writer he s willing to engage with far off difficult cultures and willing to wrestle with big ideas like death and sin he writes a prose that s both erudite and plainspoken which is hard to do he can be both trenchant and expansive in his observations often in the same well turned phrase his efforts to describe the ways in which the personal and political infuse and alter one another takes him into territory mined so productively by graham greene while each of the individual stories may not be perfectly realized it feels like there s something at stake here maybe something important hes an author work rooting for and i d definitely buy his next book

communists in denial john earl haynes and harvey klehr s in denial is a detailed analysis of the publications and techniques of america s stalin worshippers while millions of americans believe that communism died by following the collapse of the soviet union and the opening of many of the archives in russia the authors revealed that american communists remain active in the organization of american historians the american historical association in the recommendations of content for children s textbooks and in many other influential positions while nazism and communism are both totalitarian ideologies why do american universities employ worshippers of stalin but not of hitler the communist revisionist historians can be detected easily regardless of the labels they use to conceal their communist beliefs for example what did a historian write about the nazi soviet pact of august and of the role of the communist party usa cpusa stalin supported hitler s rise to power in germany american communist true believers were too stupid to understand what stalin was doing the cpusa took an anti nazism position and cheered the polish resistance to hitler until the soviet union revealed that it would invade and annex half of poland initially american communists supported a third term for president franklin roosevelt a democrat in roosevelt mandated the choice of henry wallace as his vice president when the soviet union changed policies the cpusa reversed its position and attacked roosevelt wallace won the endorsement of the american communists when he ran for president in throughout the book the authors stressed the anti communist efforts of american liberals democrats socialists neoconservatives and of former cpusa members both lenin and american conservatives shared negative views of left ofcenter politicians in western democracies american communists are still attempting to brand all anti communists as mccarthyites american communists claim that senator joseph mccarthy s congressional investigations were terrible witch hunts while ignoring or minimizing the tens of millions who were murdered or terrorized in communist countries american communists have claimed that neoconservatives neotrotskyites are anti communist in fact neoconservatives are only anti stalinamerican communists continue to hold important positions in american universities and in other important organizations neoconservatives have been able to be elected even as republicans to congress neoconservatives support the mek or mko or rajavi cult a marxist terrorist organization responsible for the murders of american military officers rockwell international employees and large numbers of innocent persons in the middle east with researchers able to study some of the russian archives it is now possible to prove that many americans lied when they claimed that they were not communists or communist spies unlike the salem witch trials and the killings of innocent persons the house committee on un american activities identified correctly many americans as being communists clearly nearly all americans need to read in denial truly ignorance is a weapon of mass destruction professor paul sheldon footecalifornia state university fullerton

phenominal book this book should be required reading for anyone who wants to be married or desires to be a mature and loving man or woman it is tender while remaining straightforward amd informative the author answers much asked and not often answered questions in a loving way i counsel young people and recommend this book to them this is a timeless classic 
short and an absolute classic this book is short but extremely thought provoking the story and characters are much different than they are portrayed in modern versions what happens if we get rid of all inhibitions is there a vile little monster inside of each of us what would be the result if we could take a potion and allow only that part of us to control our actions once you indluge that part of you either with a potion or otherwise will you ever be able to control it again was stevenson just talking about our ability to control evil thoughts or could it be about acoholism or other addictions stevenson created a short story that will leave you thinking for a long time the story is unique dark and mysterious and it is about much more than a potion it is about life and whether you can control the bad parts of you after you have induldged them or are you forever after a slave to them

great choice i ordered this book for two main reasons one because it was written by david mccullough and two because it was a collection of short stories for a little light reading of history each story in the book is thoroughly riveting not only did i enjoy all of the stories in the book but reading the glory days of medora prompted me to dig out mornings on horseback which i bought a while back and did not take the time to read after reading each of these shorts i now want to re read the other mccullough books that i ve already done and am also ready to go out and buy or order through amazon the rest of his books that i don t already own

interesting but not so practicle i actually use asset allocation in my investing strategy the author goes over some complex concepts to show how to develop a protfolio that maximizes return and minimizes risk in order to implement what the author discusses involves difficult and tedius math although the actual math concepts are not covered in the book being an engineer the math required doesn t bother me also required is access to tons of historical market data hich the author gives some references on how to obtain basicly you need to spend a bunch of money obtaining the data and a bunch of time crunching numbers in order to come up with an optomized portfolio not very practical for the average investor still there is information in the book that is useful for an advanced asset allocating investor such as the demonstaration of the low sensitivity of portfolio performance to exact allocation percentages the book is also reasonably easy to understand for a person comfortable with statistical math thorrough knowledge not required

balloons casting shadows on stars this isn t a purely positive review of this book but i liked the content take your curiousity unleash it on a home where homeless items roam and wonder the packaging is a little of everything some happy some sad the oddity of the book itself is a nice selling point one problem i had herein was that for items found in random places some sure had paragraphs wrapped around them yup some things have huuuge backstories sometimes i found myself combing through alot of wording and i kept wondering why it happened why people were being interviewed and if those words were always necessary that said i still liked the book and its content because some of the stuff within it reminded me of different things checklists of star wars figures a balloon with a wish attached that was supposed to make it to the stars a love letter that says that a relationship should end because being related just made it feel odd sometimes it takes forgotten stuff to remind me why i m reading

a fable for the modern reader checkov was a master of composing life s largest problems into beautiful language and ordinary situations which the entire world could understand granted he wrote them a long time ago but the underlying situation exists everywhere today here are three sisters completely unable to move on with their lives they are unhappy they are desperate for a change of scene they are forced to give up anyone they love to someone else but yet they remain glued to the exact place where all of this occurs olga has passed her prime masha loves someone other than her husband and irina has no idea what could possibly make her happy and all they do is talk about change but never do anything active and in the end it all comes full circle and we as an audience a reader need to decide how to not fall into such a life rut to learn by their actions as we do from aesop s fables this play is just written a great deal better with a little more comedy and tugging at the heartstrings 
too short to do itself justice spoiler below this is not one of chabon s best the language is beautiful and some of the scenes are effective for example when mr panicker is driving his dilapidated car and almost runs down the old man the descriptions are great but the plot is not fully wrought out for example was the pseudo milk plant ever fully explained what were they doing in there besides milking beef cows colonel threadneedle was from a london intelligence outfit and not from the local milk compound so who were the other guys also towards the end when the boy shows holmes the piece of scrap paper with mr black s shop address and the word blak written on it mr kalb spelled backwards how was mr holmes so sure kalb was the guilty party and that he had the bird sure mr kalb made contact with the boy but he did so in the very beginning so there s no revelation there mr kalb was the one who caught the boy falling off the roof ! someone who know the answers to these questions please post the fact that the parrot s numbers turned out to be irrelevant not bank numbers and suddenly no longer needed for the war effort was disappointing we were built up to expect something and instead the book is conveniently wrapped up and its loose ends are cut yet having thought about the ending further while i still find it disappointing on several levels i am beginning to appreciate it albeit in a cerebral kind of way the final solution explaining the parrot s numbers is the sequence of train cars headed east to the nazi death camps the numbers are representations of dehumanized people converted into numbered chattel in the last few pages the old man muses on this same theme wondering whether human reason and understanding will be replaced by lunatic cryptographers and their codes whether the dignity of man will be lost and human inquiry will be reduced to insensible numbers to binary codes percentages and stick figure calculations holmes is a living relic of yesteryear and thereby has insight into the contemporary milieu he represents the human face of curiosity bravery and resolve a gentleman s logic in the face of insoluble problems but as the book ends we are left wondering whether such virtue can carry on or whether it will die and be absorbed by the void underlying the new and rapidly changing world in the end is modern truth so esoteric as to be no more understandable than the indecipherable chatter of a bird there were some good moments in terms of character portrayal for one holmes is very well depicted we are given a man whose mind tries to overcome the failings of its body a desperate jockey tired of whipping an all butspent horse there is a poignant moment when holmes and mr panicker reach mr black s shop and find it closed holmes bumps into a mental impasse and we catch a glimpse of the despair that haunts him in his lonely hours holmes bangs on the empty shop s door with his walking stick a monday said the old man sadly i ought to have foreseen this such practical considerations seem to lie beyond my and the weak man lurches forward eyes staring as if blindly at the unanswering face of the shop what does he do when the steps of logic end when life has no clue there to greet him behind the great detective lies a feeble old man the book raised some interesting questions but on the whole it could have either been a lot shorter or a lot longer a longer book which i am in favor of would have allowed for the expansion of characters better development and a non jettisoned resolution of the plot its only pages so you won t waste too much of your time if you read this book chabon fans might read it just to keep up with their author others might check out something else 
streams i enjoy this book but sometimes i have a hard time understanding what some of the people are saying i am using it in my prayer time thank you

placing a value on knowledge when adam smith was writing about economics back in he was right in that the basics of the economy was labor capital and land at that time there was little else but since that time the technological advances that have been made are so huge that the old ideas of labor capital and land are inadequate consider for instance the value of microsoft what they really sell in the nature of a product is the arrangement of a bunch of bits of data the operating system or the word processor has a reproduction cost of near zero compared to the selling price the ability of the economics profession to value such developments has been slow to come about this book written by an economics columnist for the boston globe is a popularized treatment of some of the thinking that is taking place a very interesting few pages here and there through out the book refer to the oil industry it is interesting to consider what will happen to the whole economic world both practical and theoretical as the price of oil increases over the coming years can this new concept of the value of knowledge predict what will happen

people you really need to chill out all these reviews i read many people gave this book a bad review you really need to chill ! seroisly its just a book and i found it exciting and through every chapter it was intresting like i can understand that she took emily s horn and all and she had no control of herslef when she was in the spell it was basically about the mages having a rock concert to benifent ravenswood and kara has booked two bands but one of the bands dont show up this jhonny conrad knows alot about the mages and hangs around kara alot and doesnt seem so good later the mages banish him in a portal the only thing that bugged me was when she took emily s horn and how betraying she was to her friends so next time in the rest of the series i hope she won t be like that 
good principal disappointed in tone and tangibles i thought the principal behind the book was something that will help virtually every married couple my husband and i laughed at sections b c we found some of the anecdotes so spot on to our daily lives eggerichs clearly explained to us why we keep going through the crazy cycle the respect love needs in men women is potentially a marriage saver or breaker i have constructive criticisms of the book i still recommend this book however i do give these caveats this book talks as if men know how to love their wives there may be a million books out there on how to do it but we didn t have those my husband and i were reading this one and i grew weary of hearing how women needed to learn to respect their husbands frankly i grasped the principal within the first few pages after a few chapters i felt like rolling my eyes a little because he paid so little attention to talking about how men should love their wives it felt like that part was very trivialized i understand that was not the point however the title was love respect not just respect i would have liked more tangible examples of exactly what it means to respect my husband i want to do it and he made it clear that nagging complaining and whining at him were disrespectful but i need more examples what are the active things i can do is it disrespectful to remind my husband to take the garbage out the night before if it is then how do i make sure the task gets done w out reminding him it isn t an issue of control but i have to get the kids out the door in the morning and i need help and i need him to do this one thing make sense i need to know how to have those discussions w out disrespecing him i hestitate to use this as a small group book b c it is so one sided and it tends to repeat itself again i got the principal pretty quickly and as good as it is after a while enough is enough another reviewer said it felt a bit like a brochure for the conference that is exactly how i felt a good book yes a helpful principle absolutely a must read maybe but definitely helpful to a christian marriage and therefore i do and would recommend it 
precise centered reflection that has not dimmed with years george macdonald s classic work continues to take the breath away of spiritual pilgrims who find him for the first time these small sonnets are each gems that act as windows for persons to catch a glimpse of the heart of god and the heart of a man clearly connected to the spirit s yearning in his life these are best read slowly and savored but as with any true classic each time they are read they have a richer meaning the readings are arranged by month one per day 
for the serious scholar this book by pritchard best serves serious historians though not necessarily those specializing in the near east indeed the images and the translations are valuable for the mythologist or the art historian i have found it to be very useful in my own research 
tangling with a feisty morning glory i don t believe i ve ever seen a gardening book where the information was as well organized as it is in annuals for michigan and its companion volume perennials for michigan often books of regional interest are thrown together and published on the cheap but these books are tightly bound full of color illustrations and above all well written and they re really about michigan climate and michigan soils someone didn t just go through and change say iowa to michigan with a word processor then rename the book according to the authors michigan ranks third nationwide in the production of annual plants so we must have a pretty decent climate for growing them i ve only had a couple escape from their beds and attempt to take over the yard the morning glory grandpa ott and every kind of mallow i ve ever tried so don t be afraid to experiment our winters usually exterminate the overly bold the book begins with a pictorial guide called the flowers at a glance where photographs of the annuals are listed in alphabetical order by common name there is a short introduction on trends in annuals and a map of the average last frost dates for michigan so that you will know when to plant out depending on where you live the next few sections explain how to start annuals both by growing them from seed or by schlepping over to the nearest gardening center and buying them there are chapters on caring for annuals and the obligatory chapter on problems pests before we plunge into the heart of this book the alphabetically arranged sections on each of the selected annuals each species is described including height spread and flower color each has subsections on planting how and when to start your plants growing tips recommended varieties and usually problems and pests there are over color photographs usually but not always labeled by variety to help with your decisions on what to plant there is also a very nice quick reference chart in back that lists the colors sowing method height hardiness light and soil requirements for each species there is even a short list of companies and their websites where you can purchase seed although a couple of my favorites aren t mentioned i e thompson and morgan and park seed annuals are so much fun if you hate the color combinations you tried one year you can start all over again the following spring sometimes if you re lucky a favorite annual like love inamist will reseed itself and return even more beautifully the following season of course that could also happen with pests like grandpa ott we finally had to concede defeat after five years of weeding purple morning glories out of the vegetable beds we sold our house to someone who hopefully loves this old vine

a patina of memories as someone who grew up in a small town in texas i can identify with so much of this book my late mother s childhood and her stories of growing up in a rural area with colorful characters are very similar to mr foote s story if you didn t grow up in this era or in a small town these stories may not have the charm i feel about them but horton foote could bring a tear to a glass eye with his charming memories and i will bet that he can tug at your heartstrings as well there is a place for sentiment and burnished memories in this busy life of ours and i found myself wanting more after reading this memoir as i read this book i found myself envisioning the whole story in a pleasant sepia toned soft cocoon of a state of mind you come too 
very nice book for theory review i would say that the structure of this book pleased me i used it as a theory review for my qualifying exam in linear algebra for that purpose it served quite well it has a nice constructive structure it will make your knowledge organized and will not overload you with too much abstractions especially i enjoyed the fact that definitions and key theorems are situated separately from their proofs that allow you to familiarize yourself with theory in general and after you know everything there you may concentrate on the proofs to make your knowledge more sophisticated at least this is the way how i did work with this book as for exercises they are not very difficult i would say undergraduate level only so that it is good for those who has a weak knowledge in this subject for those who want to go beyond linear algebra i would suggest kostrykin volumes but it is in russian 
very good read this was an excellent biography very well written and extreemly interesting spured on by the movie the aviator i set out to learn more about this remarkable man after reading the book i am more amazed and saddened by the life he lived it leaves you a lot to ponder over did his parents contribute to his mental problems or was he just born with the inability to love anything ever very fasinating great book 
a classic i read this book several dozen times when i was a kid vicariously living my dream of making it in the wild some kids are bored with it it goes into quite a bit of detail and is slow paced but others love it it tends to interest kids with a lot of imagination or an inclination to be a writer the sequels don t hold a candle to the original 
a challenge and a pleasure at the same proportion to read marcel proust s remembrance of things past is a pleasure and a challenge in the same proportion that any brave read can have not only is it a hard task but also a very pleasant one the books are written in such a way that readers are transported to another time and place and get to know the characters as if they were old friends of ours of course if it weren t like that not many people would dare to try and read the seven novels that compound the whole series but proust is a master to keep your interested glued to his words even when this words are in a paragraph that lasts four pages swanns way is the first novel and it is a blessing and a curse at the same time it is good because everything is new to us so the nameless narrator takes his time to explain a lot of things introduce people describe places and the action is built up bit by bit on the other hand the reader is not used to proust style and when we come across a paragraph that lasts four pages we get scared to make things more complicated when he was writing remembrance of things past proust wanted to make a novel but he also wanted to philosophize therefore there is a lot of philosophy in his books at first this device seems to be difficult to understand to get the gist but with time one gets used to it and is able to realize that we re not supposed to read this books in the same way we read any other novel prousts work is about senses he does not expect you to understand everything he is saying his narrative is not cumulative what he wants in fact is to make his reader feel what he was saying to feel things like time passing through our lives and its effects on our memories bearing this in mind any reader is able to focus on the poetic narrative and the author s idea rather than understanding the events of course there is a plot in the book but there are things that are more important to produce the effect proust wanted swanns way begins with the nameless narrator remembering experiences from his childhood in combray but the largest section of the novel is not about him but about swann a friend of his family fifteen years before the events described in the first part swann felt in love with odette a woman with a terrible reputation and this love affair will affect his life forever despite proust s language being evocative it is not difficult to understand his sentences his work is replete of references and allusions mostly to visual arts namely painting some descriptions are like the works of monet and botticelli the writer also has interest in literature the main character relationship to his mother echoes works as oedipus rex qualities like these make remembrance of things past one of the most important works produced ever with his caldron of references ideas and images proust has created one of the most beloved works from the xx century it is certain that this series of books will be read for many many years to come and will be seen as a definition of what we used to think 
refreshing viewpoints in an old debate the debate surrounding shakespeare s sonnets has raged on for a long time and much of the scholarship on them has remained nebulous repetitive and overworked james schiffer s volume however is refreshingly brilliant and provocative the essays he includes address an array of topics that are often overlooked while many of the arguments are simultaneously revisionist and visionary challenging the conventional wisdom that has guided the criticism on the sonnets for so long and what s even better the arguments are beautifully and meticulously presented crafted by some of the foremost shakespeareans of our time

a must if you want to understand yugoslavia this is the sixth book i ve read about yugoslavia since we bombed belgrade this spring it should have been the first like most americans i had virtually no knowledge about this important part of the world what i read in the media only confused me this author gives a concise overview of yugoslav history up through the s and he presents his information in an interesting amp lucid way it is interesting to read his views on kosovo in light of recent events which took place ten years after this book was published if i had read this book first the information in the other books i ve read would have been much more useful to me 
a beautiful story i m not sure how i missed this short novel pages in the hardback edition when it was published in i ve never read a better story about a gay teenager the narrator is billy connors a sophomore in high school in the bronx he volunteers to work in the eugene mccarthy presidential campaign because he does not want to go to vietnam and mccarthy was the peace candidate and he has a crush on al the college student in charge of the local volunteer office the novel is set in around the time when robert kennedy was killed a horrible time in our nation s history though small in size this novel novella long short story whatever will knock you off your feet i read it straight through billy is a fantastic character grappling with all the craziness associated with being a teenager as well as dealing very well with his emerging feelings for other boys the boys on the rock ought to be required reading in high school for all students both straight and gay no lesser writers than edmund white richard price and russell banks praised this book mr banks prophecy has come true when he predicted that this novel may well turn out to be a classic sadly this novel will have to be mr fox s to kill a mockingbird since he is deceased having been stricken down in the first wave of aids cases 
the cowboy life cities on the plain is the final volume in cormac mccarthy s border trilogy a loosely tied together trio of novels that deal with life along the u smexico border this novel focuses on the protagonists of each of the first two books john grady cole from all the pretty horses and billy parham from the crossing now the two of them are working together on a ranch in new mexico in the early s the rather sketchy plot involves cole who has fallen hard for a mexican prostitute his love for her has more than a little bit of obsession to it and cole is willing to risk all to be with her it is his eventual intent to bring her to the u s and marry her although her pimp may have other ideas at times however the story is secondary as we follow the other smaller adventures in these characters lives mccarthy s great gifts are with his descriptive ability he is not always an easy read however he never uses quotes to set off his dialogue and he uses a lot of spanish much of which is left untranslated and for a non spanish speaker can only be partially gleaned from context despite these difficulties the book is somehow a pleasure to read although it is probably the weakest in the trilogy in some ways it is reminiscent of the movie brokeback mountain if only because it follows the rough life of modern cowboys cole and parham live tough lives with little hope of any permanence or prosperity but they are also somewhat content with their choices mccarthy is probably an overrated writer with his distinct style providing an illusion of greater ability than he actually has but even if he is not great he is still good and if you have the patience you may find this an enjoyable book 
one of the best elementary intermediate book i used this book as a student and still use it for teaching pieces are nice and students are challenged to think musically it moves quicker than some other method books it covers materials from elementary to early intermediate upon completion of the first grade book students can play standard repertoire in the early intermediate level students must have completed early elementary level before using this book because this book starts with playing two hands in c position emphasize phrasing from the first piece highly recommended 
my attitude is great about this book i heard keith harrell speak at a sales meeting in january and immediately bought his book keith is the real deal he weaves stories about his life into the principles he reveals about how much our attitude effects our lives and the lives of those around us he obviously has a relationship with god and he uses that relationship as the foundation stone for his belief system i highly recommend this book for adults and teenagers alike 
a wonderful book purse masterpieces is a wonderful addition to the literature on antique and vintage purses many examples pictured in this book have never been seen before some of them dating to the th century seven other individual collectors contributed to this book the sections on beaded mesh and dance purses has some lovely examples which any collector would be proud to add to her collection another section on frames shows some beautiful jeweled pieces that have not been seen in the exisitng literature in her first chapter ms schwartz discusses the relationship of purse designs with the more traditional art form of painting archeology egyptian and literature she makes a connection that has not been made in the past in other books on purses which adds to the literature and makes for a very interesting read her value guide is just that a guide as all purse collectors know prices vary from one end of the country to the other from venue to venue and year to year i highly recommend this book to all antique and vintage purse collectors 
excellent memoir and very insightful this is an excellent autobiography the general s career and development is amazing to have reached stars at such a young age his modesty and emphasis on the south korean army s development into a complete military organization while at war is remarkable what makes this book sobering is when the general describes how thousands of south koreans volunteered and were sent straight into combat with little training only to quickly become casualties themselves sacrificing their lives for their country another key item from the general s writing is how only after having the time to fully train equip and organize into divisions with adequate firepower were they able to successfully conduct offensive operations bravery and courage helped them hold against the north korean communist attack along the desperate pusan perimeter but it was the firepower of the attached us artillery units that were supporting his south korean division that allowed them to counterattack successfully and reach panmunjom the personal family dangers in war is also brought out where he writes about his family who had to be left behind in seoul unable to flee when the north koreans captured the city the additional suffering of the civilian populace is also described in this book caught trying to flee the communist army highly recommended reading for the south korean view of the war excellent insight into how important it is to have trained and properly equipped soldiers when fighting a war rather than relying on conscripted soldiers after war has started as the conscripted soldiers will suffer excessive casualties and deaths when fighting against a motivated trained and fully armed enemy 
delightful from beginning to end as a parent this may very well be my favorite bedtime story don t judge the book based on the tv show it is much better ! max and ruby are making birthday cakes for grandma max is making an earthworm cake but ruby wants to make an angel surprise cake with rasbery fluff frosting despite ruby s increasingly restrictive instructions max keeps knocking her ingredients off the table and ruby keeps sending him to the store with a shopping list for replacements max wants red hot marshmellow squirters to top off his cake and his attempts to communicate this to the grocer make up the heart of the story the illustrations are delightful and are cleverly incorporated as part of the story my year old loves this book and believe it or not he gets tired of it before i do 
a fair question great responses is scientific research winding down is what we can know scientifically coming to an end at some point every scientist asks him herself this question it s a fair question for a journalist and a great one for access to so many scientists i enjoyed the breadth of scientific scope here along with the conversational style truth be told i am envious of mr horgan s ability to spend time with all of these people i appreciate being able to read both their and his thoughts on the premise of this book is science at an end never as long as there are folks around to ask the question and stimulate debate i recommend this book wholeheartedly to everyone interested in contemporary science 
a quotmust read quot for fans of the green mile sorry i m rating this book even though i ve yet to read it i ve only just recently seen the movie but i m definitely buying the book stephen king s best work is not in the horror stories for which he is famous for don t get me wrong i love the horror also his best work is in stories like quotshawshank redemption quot and quotthe green mile quot these are not horror stories though parts of the stories will horrify you and really make you think they ll also make you laugh and ball your eyes out many people i ve recommended quotthe green mile quot to do not believe that stephen king is the author these are two stories that will touch you in a way that you will not believe possible the movie quotshawshank redemption quot is phenomenal ! i m really looking forward to reading this book 
heavy construction cost data th edition this is a great reference guide in standard version to avoid confusion the isbn number for the metric version is 
warm hearted witty and reminiscent of the paper bag princess i loved this book and so did my two pre schoolers it is a great retelling of cinderella with a modern slant cinder edna and cinderella are neighbours while cinderella pines away and sleeps in the cinders to keep warm edna finds it too dirty and so after she does the work for her wicked step mother and step sisters she goes out and cleans bird cages and mows lawns cinder edna is a spunky fun character while cinderella can t get to the ball without her fairy god mothers help cinder edna has organised a dress on layaway and catches the bus and while there have been discussions i see on here about feminist overtones and environmental issues all of which are here the thing i liked most about this is that people really need to earn what they get we end up rewarded for what we put in so cinder edna and cinderella really end up with exactly what they put in i like the concept of consequences and planning anyway this book makes me laugh some of the lines are priceless and my kids adore the story so it works well on both adult and child levelthe illustrations are quite neat i think they much be pastel and they have a wonderful s kitsch feel about them the step mother and step sisters are extraodinary i would really recommend this book it left me with the same feeling the paperbag princess did a real spunky heroine who can look after herself there are some utterly classic lines in this boo 
twilight zone fans will love it i really liked this one it s been a long time since i ve read any short story collection and i m glad i read this one actually didn t read it i did this one on audio there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories they all kept me guessing also since they were all with twist endings i anticipated what might happen but didn t often see what was coming this is my first jeffery deaver book i had avoided them since i hated the movie of bone collector but i now want to read some more of his books i m hoping that hollywood ruined a good writer s work 
better than the tape version i use an audio copy of p p when teaching it in class we read through important passages together without the loss of my voice i previously owned a tape version horrible because you had to ff to whatever parts you wanted in fact my player ended up eating of the tapes this cd version is much better and i would highly recommend it except normal audio cds have tracks that correspond with the chapters not this one the tracks were in random places in the middle of a paragraph even in the middle of sentences so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work if you re just planning to listen from start to finish however this is an excellent version the reader is splendid 
pathos and politics i have read most of e l doctorow s novels and take great pleasure in the smoothness of their narratives the sense that doctorow has not misplaced or misused a single word this same master s quality is evident in the book of daniel where it brings great imaginative precision to the lives of the paul and rachel isaacson a couple who are executed as spies and who are modeled on the rosenbergs to me the book s most moving writing has the narrator the isaacson s son daniel remembering his parents as people with friends and commonplace lives not as the couple who became powerful political symbols in the book s end doctorow puts dr mindish the government s chief witness against the isaacsons in disney land years after the trial spinning pathetically on a ride lacking identity in a gaudy and forgetful america 
one of the best books on this subject for kids of any age i have a fairly sizeable collection of titanic books but until now i had nothing written and illustrated specifically for children ken marschall is a consummate illustrator and his artwork in this book is stunning one of the important things is that the story is about two real children one in first class one in steerage who were actually on the titanic while even for kids there can be no happy ending to this story the book follows the main characters lives past the sinking and rescue into adulthood and till their deaths the story is written with low key emotion and is more factual than overwhelmingly sad the story of the titanic is almost years old but the lessons we learn from it today are as important as those learned back in it s an important true story well worth purchasing to read with your kids 
a great attempt to see what cannot be seen how do we find the origins of anything in mythology and folklore there have been attempts to use language and the narratives themselves to recreate the origins others attempt to apply pyschological theory to explain the commonness of quotmans mythic past quot quotmanquot here a term purposely chosen to reflect the patriarchical veil that most studies have processed the world through marcel detienne does some of these things in his search for the origins of greek mythology the term quotmythologyquot is used as a general word and does not reflect later attempts to classify and identify different type of narratives while i may not agree with all of his statements and the translation leaves a bit ot be desired as all translations due i might add i am very pleased as a historian to say that detienne has no problem saying flat out quotwe may never know quot the origins of greek mythology this may leave many readers at a loss if the book was chosen to give all the answers but it is a far more realistic approach that attempts to create what can never be uncovered and to understand what has no record

anger hated this book but read it anyway kenneth anger deserves a much more serious and scholarly bio but this will do for now he s literally cursed landis for this work and you can see why landis has dug up lots of dirt about the controversial film maker and shares much about his early life including his birth name reservations aside anger s lived such a fabulous and improbable life and created such forward looking and brilliant films that the ride is a fast and furious one film students and fans of the counter culture in the s s and s will love this as i did where is anger s autobiography now that would be a trip to read

some of the best most authentic thai recipes after having gone through several supposedly quotauthenticquot books on the subject i decided to take a cooking class i was annoyed that my versions of thai cuisine never seemed to even come close to even a typical restaurant chat was the one who was teaching that day and in about one hour i had somehow created my favorite dish green curry ! i couldn t believe that with a few specialized ingredients the elusive magic that i wanted was there i made my own green curry paste first that i think made all the difference you can t duplicate something like this from a can or jar in some store we did several other dishes that day during class and every single ingredient somehow stayed distinct what i m trying to say is that chat is an amazing cook ! this book of his has all recipes you could want on the cuisine and it really is authentic because he grew up there ! a big difference he runs over how and why the food is different by region he identifies the common unique ingredients in most of the dishes like galangal root thai bird eye chilies kaffir lime and fish sauce of course and there are many pictures that go along with each dish each recipe is all laid out and described in one page because he makes it very easy he s very good at explaining as well the reasons why one prepares an ingredient a certain way like using a mortar and pestle instead of the blender this is my favorite cookbook from a person who really made me feel like i can actually cook i ve since had four cooking parties with over ten people with recipes from chat 
great book i m not very good writing in english but this book rules is quite serious and the investigation is very well done the pics are great so the editio 
puts modern serial killers to shame it says a lot for a story when it begins with a shipwreck and builds in intensity from there batavias graveyard painstakingly researched and written by mike dash starts shortly before the proud richly laden dutch merchantman batavia on her maiden voyage for the dutch east india co in shattered its hull on a coral reef near australia and some miles shy of its destination in java it could have been a simple story of survival if not for the presence of jeronimus cornelisz aboard the doomed vessel at first glance a simple mid ranking official for the company cornelisz harbored heretical ideas and an overblown sense of his own importance in the scheme of things and he had the intelligence and charisma to bend others to his will long before the shipwreck occurred cornelisz had plotted mutiny and piracy on the batavia but once he found himself stranded with more than survivors and limited resources to keep them alive the dutchman decided to take matters into his own hands and decide who should live and die it might be somewhat hard to believe if this were fiction but dash has drawn his story from the logs court records and testimonials of the day as history batavia s graveyard is a gripping deeply disturbing tale dash should be commended for his ability to present the story with such perfect balance between sensational drama and stark historical facts there are enough notes and references to sate even the most passionate researcher and the narrative never falters in its flow by tom knapp rambles net edito

a long overdue return to old man and the sea a joyful read reading once again old man and the sea by ernest hemingway was simply a joyful reading experience that will stay with me for a very long time the writing is eloquent yet raw the reader experience humble yet filled with sheer power the connectivity is filled with singularity yet there is a sense of one with the universe there is of course so much that has been written and said about old man and the sea that i will not write a commentary about this marvelous book s movement however what i will say is this there are books that are indeed worth returning to since they have a timelessness to the story and as the reader s own life experience grows so too does the appreciation and understandings of the written story in this compelling book i have found that the meaning of this story so powerful and connected to my soul in few ways a book ever has do yourself a favor go pick up old man and the sea and enjoy yourself though you may be holding a paperbook in your hand you may soon come to realize your actually holding a mirrow and you re peering into your own life 
an important and impressive book i lived in japan when the subway attack happened and i will never forget the reaction from the japanese people they were terrified ! when this book came out i bought it immediately expecting the usual quality level of non fiction books that hit the stands soon after an event boy was i surprised this is an excellent excellent read no exagerations so sensationalism but still both fast paced and revealing as a reader of japanese newspapers i had a fairly good picture of what had happened before but this book gave me so much more background as another reader commented the scary thing is that the authorities did nothing not wanting to quotrock the boat quot

huge fun an amazing tale of the fantastic cover and deception schemes devised by the allies primarily brits to deceive the germans about the normandy invasion plans wonderfully clever and often downright amusing in conception and delivery many of these fanciful schemes had phonominal success in disorienting the germans providing a total surprise for the allies on d day saving perhaps tens of thousands of allied soldiers lives and very likely determing the outcome of the war itself anthony cave brown tells the story with conviction gusto and humor why didn t his book get on my list years ago

best book on agroecology i highly recommend the book agroecology by steve gliessman it reflects indepth knowledge of agricultural issues of today food production systems those of us interested in challenging thoughts and ideas to achieve sustainability must look at the contributions of this book some chapters demand basic knowledge of ecology while other chapters demand higher level of ecology and biology the book provides examples from different parts of the world tropical and temperate zones so that it should be very useful to agronomists and agroecologists from countries other than the us as an agroecologist i highly recommend this book i find it very useful to teach agroecology and ecology in both agricultural schools and biology students

enjoyed this was a pretty decent story mixing a little science fiction timetraveling turtledove makes an interesting story obviously it is a little more far fetched than the recent gettysburg or his own alternate events series though amazon always packages this tale with how few remain they are in fact two differant series how few remain is the first novel of a multipart alternate timeline series this story is self contained 
suberb a very well written book tried and true classic european and american recipes as well as others with a more exotic twist plenty of useful information and instruction on how to braising is probably my favorite way to cook if you do it right and it s easy to do it right you get the most succulent and satisfying meals with ease a little bit of prep bang it in the oven or leave it slow simmer on the stovetop and in to hours you ve got a great meal ive looked at the few books out there devoted to this subject and in my opinion hers is one of the best not only does she give you plenty of yummy recipes she gives you plenty of info on the various ways to braise cuts of meat and info on the types of containers pots etc one can use for braising and why you would use a particular container she also gives tips on how to make a too deep covered dish into a braiser in braising the more shallow the pot the better my only regret is i didn t buy this on amazon i paid full price i was so pleased with the content when i browsed it in the book store i just had to get it right then and there

truth might be scarier than this fiction think of animal farm combined with yellow submarine with running banter from veggie tales in this political fable national populations number in the handful the outer horner militia for example consists of freeda melvin and larry and all the inhabitants look like refugees from evolution s junkyard a character might have glossy black filaments say with a tuna can tail the trouble begins when inner horner a phone booth of a country population shrinks by inches forcing one resident to poke partway over the border to the larger outer horner this incident sets the stage in the surrounding area for a nationalist demagogue phil whose ideas are proving just a little smarter and more sadistic than freeda s and the others after a few days worth of fines and taxes that leave the inner hornerites naked and trembling phil rather easily sells his countrymen on the need to dismember their imagined enemies us being us do we not being fully good have the right to end what totally bad threatens us even in the slightest he just as easily dupes his own senile president into giving up power and soon has everybody outdoing each other to see who can be the most unreflective about signing a patriot act sounding certificate of total approval ill sign it without even looking at it said larry ill sign it with my eyes closed said leon the border guard ill sign it with my eyes closed facing away from it said melvin only a reluctant invasion by the pleasant coffee drinkers of greater keller can stop the cancer from spreading there too although the book is very thin the modern metaphor definitely resonates and it s obviously fun to read the sandbox scale of things in particular seems inspired and helps make both national tyrant and sheeplike followers seem as infantile and stupid as they should saunders does very well not to make a full novel of this or to stylize he has kept the book very small its a mere scenario really the book s drawback is that in the age of karl rove our reality may have already outstripped the fiction saunders book isn t as fresh as orwell s naming jails peaceencouraging enclosures is a dated echo of orwellian doublespeak but it also goes further than animal farm and by doing so forecloses hope his social darwinism suggests there will always be demagogues and sheep and that the cowardice in us is ineradicable even by god the book offers a wink to those of us who think we re better who day by day allow our nation to go to the bullies but he s preaching to the already converted who read stuff like this or who read at all saunders story needs a savior figure theres absolutely no one in his universe to like 
yeaaaa bravo bernabo ! was that how you spelled it i can t recall sounds jewish to me or something out of edwardian adventure lit not equally insidious but equally boring white supremacist then ! male dominant ! bernabo recites the catechism pay attention or you are all racist sexist homophobic anti semites hisssssssss

and research turns to wonder i m a rower in high school on the west coast and you don t really hear much about rowing over here since it s mostly an east coast sport so when my history teacher started going over thomas eakins and showed a clip about him from a documentary with some examples of his rowing paintings my attention was immediately captures i decided to do my term paper on him but i expected it to be a long and tedious process judging from the book i got from the library which looked plain boring and old so i put it off till the last minute i just picked up the book an hour ago for the first time and just got online to see if they had any copies of it since it proved to be well written and interesting so you don t space out so much in the middle of paragraphs like i tend to and because it led me to think about things that are important parts of learning and art and life but nobody ever talks about this book proved to be insightful and fascinating and after only one chapter i m hooked on the subject ! and to think i was dreading reading it 
quintessence of a spiritual genius gravity and grace by simone weil with an introduction by gustave thibon translated from the french by emma craufurd london routledge and kegan paul isbn x gravity and grace is a slim book of in my edition just pages which holds within itself the quintessence of the greatest spiritual genius of the th century the book is a compilation of brief extracts from simone weil s notebooks and was assembled by gustav thibon who has also added a valuable introduction of pages the purpose of which is simply to provide readers with some necessary background for as he points out simone weil s writings belong to the category of very great work which can only be weakened and spoilt by a commentary mthibon has organized these sayings into chapters detachment the self illusions idolatry love evil violence contradiction chance beauty the great beast etc the original french edition la pesanteur et la grace paris plon contained an additional chapter on israel pp which the english publishers for reasons best known to themselves have silently omitted from the english edition whether it has since been restored i don t know i purchased my own copy of this book bibliographical details of which are given above over thirty years ago although many hundreds if not thousands of books have passed through my hands since then it remains one of five or six books i would never ever consider parting with simone weil s thoughts are so truthful and of such power that one never forgets them and her book becomes one that you find yourself returning to again and again here are a few of those thoughts selected at random we cannot under any circumstances manufacture something which is better than ourselves p the only organ of contact with existence is acceptance love p imaginary evil is romantic and varied real evil is gloomy monotonous barren boring imaginary good is boring real good is always new marvellous intoxicating p joy is the overflowing consciousness of reality p gravity and grace brings us the truth about the human condition the truth about ourselves and much of this truth is far from comforting as m thibon points out it is not a question of philosophy here but of life the life that all of us are at this moment living and that simone weil can help us more fully appreciate and understand her thoughts weave themselves into the fabric of one s mind and will leave any sensitive reader immeasurably enriched

enjoyable by young and old alike the earth is surrounded by a sinister presence a dark foul fog that is the tool of an ultimate evil whose ambition is to enslave the planet with the complete removal of free will three magical beings mrs whatsit mrs who and mrs which witches angels demigods perhaps appear to margaret and charles wallace murry and their friend calvin o keefe to persuade them that it is their destiny to battle this evil on its own turf and to rescue margaret and charles wallace s father dr murry has been missing for some months and the kids learn that he has been captured by the evil while he was tessering traveling time and space in the course of his scientific research while the writing is straightforward well crafted and obviously aimed at a younger audience a wrinkle in time is nonetheless a fast paced enjoyable tale of good vs evil that combines elements of science fiction fantasy and magic even adult readers will flip through relentlessly but there are lots of life lessons issues and moral themes sprinkled throughout low hanging fruit just waiting for the eager child the observant questioning teen the confused parent or thinking adult to pick and chew on as it were the coming of age realization that parents are not infallible the cruelty of malicious gossip god and evil the awkwardness of romantic adolescent relationships the potential destructiveness of pride or vanity the marginalizing of people who are different the enormous difficulties of selflessness the understanding that all life s questions will not be answered and more while some readers criticize a wrinkle in time as being overtly moralist i felt somewhat differently it was clear to me that religion and in particular christian symbolism was present but i felt that l engle let it sit quietly just beneath the surface and the story never became even remotely preachy it is little wonder that a wrinkle in time has been elevated to the status of children s classic and continues to be enjoyed by adults and children alike more than years after it was first published for a grateful reading world paul weis 
something like a review one of the greatest pleasures imaginable is to investigate a body of cinematic work and then to learn about its creator from his own persepective on his life and art there is tremendous satisfaction in seeing the personality of the director reveal itself in the work and to re view the films with new knowledge of the creator this may not be a false track although auteur theory has a bad rap right now kurosawa in the conclusion of his autobiography said look for me in my films kurosawa was a genius his films full of life and compassion and strength he did not look away from ugly truths in his life or art read the autobiography and understand the significance of this approach ! i recommend this book as the touchstone for a deeper appreciation of the art of kurosawa for an understanding of his complex personality and for the human warmth that comes across in his reminiscences by the end of the book you will want more of course it will seem to end abruptly and too soon you will have many questions that you will wish to have answered but then we ll take kuroswa s advice we ll look for the man in his films 
far far better than the newest movie okay i went into this book after seeing the remake of haunting of house hill i ve never seen the original and can only pray that it does more justice to the book its a short and easy read but interesting the characters don t seem too developed but it is a ghost story and i think it does it s job at being creepy ive read the lottery by shirley jackson and plan on getting more of her stuff

not her best but very good i was a little wary of reading this book since she was never able to get it published during her lifetime despite trying for many years i assumed that if she couldn t get it published that it probably wasn t very good i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this book it is meant to be a satirical work mocking the gothic romance popular during jane austin s lifetime in such romances there were fictional monsters and secret corridors and such and in this book the main character catherine keeps thinking that such things were going to pop up or had popped up but they never really had towards the end instead of some fantastic mythical monster a real monster emerges as the culprit behing the pain catherine experiences pride in rank the father of henry tilney whom catherine has fallen in love with refuses to allow them to be married because catherine is of a lower rank and has less money that his family does austin vilifies the wealth heriarchy of her day through both henry s father and through her friend isabella who tries to do anything that she can to marry someone wealthier than herself leading catherine to much pain this is nowhere near as good as some of miss austin s other works but it is good nontheless and a fun read it s much better if you understand what gothic romance novels were like since this is a satire on those novels overall grade b 
witty this book is hilarious at times i mean it teaches economics well also but the best part is the dry witty humor characteristic of perloff himself took a seminar with the guy he ruleeeez with a z 
one of those changes my life books i love this book i m not a scientist of any sort im a linguist and lay pastor but this book took me into a realm i had never been i read it on the beach got totally sunburnt because i couldn t put the book down and go in the house i m sure bakker had no idea a something divorced mom college prof was going to relate to his book in this manner but here s what i took away from it it explained to me the prime directive of biological life to pass on our dna no matter what we re doing throughout our lives we are driven by the same urge to attract a worthy mate who will engender healthy offspring and help us raise those offspring to continue to pass on our dna even though red is completely unaware of this directive it guides every choice she makes from the moment she wakes in the morning til she falls asleep at night having lost her own chick she risks her life time and again to help rear her sister s chick and see the chick safely grown mated and producing viable offspring other chicks of her same breed are interesting important too but do not arouse in her the protective urge that her sister s chick does they don t carry any thing near the close dna match that her sister s chick does why waste time and resources on them unless her sister s chick is safe this explains why i adore my brother s chicks i mean kids but i m not real crazy about my nephew inlaw he s got none of my dna and he has my brother inlaws snout from red i learned several things about relationships that i believe are based upon how deeply the prime directive is encoded into our biology and i think that realizing how engrained these behaviors are in our psyche can help us make better choices to acknowledge the directive and act according to it or to lay it aside on occasion for another higher purpose some of these lessons are attempt to make yourself appear healthy acknowledge what the healthy signals are to your species and culture and do what you can within reasonable bounds to accomodate those so that you can attract the largest number of mates possible from which to choose the best mate for yourself red spent hours trying to smoothe over scars on her thighs for fear the male raptors would think she had fallen during hunting choose a mate that is not only healthy refer to species specific and culturally determined codes for assessing health but also exhibits character traits that assure him to be capable of a engendering healthy offspring b hunting successfully with me since raptors and humans hunt in pairs c protecting said offspring until they are old enough to pass on their our dna themselves give him a good sniff at first meeting to make sure that he smells enough like your littermates to be like you but enough different from your littermates that he s not ewww one of them if a potential mate comes to do his dance of love and his nodding and bobbing just don t appeal to you don t feel guilty about it move on there s something amiss there soon there will be some suitor whose moves will thrill you right down to your tarsal claws i mean toenails pay close attention to female relationships they can provide very valuable assistance when your chicks need a hand across a raging flooded stream while you are stranded downstream once your chicks are able to find their own mates and they re off making their own chicks you have complied with the prime directive you are home free and now sex is for fun ! find that mate and party hardy 
novel exceeded my expectations here s a novel that many accuse of not being a novel at all at being a polemic a bunch of essays and diatribes disguised as a novel true perhaps but the craft and aristry of coetzee is so exquisite that he pulls it off here s the situation an aging writer elizabeth costello award winnning novelist and humanist and animal lover is asked to lecture after winning her awards and she speaks on a variety of subjects the role and responsibility of the novelist the nature of evil christianity vs greek philosophy the brutality of animals and an argument for vegetarianism the nature of the third world novel each subject is presented in a separate chapter in which costello either lectures or argues with other intelligent people so that you get not just costello s worldview but a vigorous opposition in this way costello s views don t go unchallenged also her views especially comparing the slaughter of animals to the holocaust causes great controversy and animosity between her and the community in another case she accuses the novelist paul west of exploiting nazi evil in his graphic and indulgent portrayals of it resulting in the writing community to accuse her of cencorship these contentious scenes give her arguments a context and a drama that essays wouldn t have provided vulnerable fragile at times not always prepared to answer her detractors elizabeth costello is a very human advocate for her positions and never comes across as a bullying superhuman to mouthpiece coetzee s philosophy he s too subtle an artist for that i think there is a place for a novel of ideas gulliver s travels and voltaire certainly were such novels and elizabeth costello is worthy of following their lead 
an excellent book tape for fans of frog and toad books i am ordering this tape again for my four year old son he listened to his first copy until it broke it is fascinating to watch him listen to the stories with a half smile on his face as he recalls the pictures from the books it is not necessary to read along to enjoy the tape mr lobel reads the stories perfectly he clearly conveys the personalities of the characters without quotdoing the voices quot

cute this is a cute book with stuff that you can make out of everyday stuff ! i highly recommend it 
for those ready to take responsibility for their relationships i disagree with the reviewer who stated the author suggests that emotionally abused women are a certain type as if they set themselves up for the abuse and or are drawn to it if you believe that rape victims are somewhat responsible when violated because of the way they dressed or behaved then you may be able to get past the first few pages of this book otherwise this book is not for you emotional abuse can and does happen to women who experienced no form of abuse whatsoever in their childhood these women can be intelligent attractive and self assured often the abuse is so undetected a form of brainwashing that who they are actually changes over time so that those qualities are not as prevalent the woman is not at fault for the abuse despite her own interpersonal weaknesses she is not the cause the reason why i disagree with the commentary above is because this book is for those who have a pattern of ending up in abusive relationships end up in one abusive relationship shame on that person end up in a series of abusive relationships and one really could benefit from exploring why she is so drawn to the same type of individual abuser repeatedly if you feel compelled to compare emotional abuse to rape then one could ask if you walked down a particular alley and were raped certainly that would not be your fault but would you keep walking down that same alley time and again knowing that a rapist was awaiting you at the other end the fact is that most abusive partners exhibit what are called red flag warnings early enough into the union so that a woman who is astute to these and who knows how to set firm boundaries can oftentimes spare herself the grief of being abused yet again at the least she can extricate herself from the relationship asap once she recognizes that she is being abused therefore the pervasive message of this book is not that women are to blame for being abused but that with awareness they have a choice as to whether or not to go down that same alley again they can decide who they get involved with remain involved with and why this is an empowering message a lot more so than telling women you are completely powerless when it comes to your relationships no matter what you think choose say or do if you are going to be a victim of abuse you are going to be a victim of abuse accept it yikes there are different stages of recovery for targets of emotional abuse one of the earlier stages often enough being to blame others for their own issues choices and the predicaments they find themselves in once they realize they are being abused and are understandably quite angry and defensive about this whereas the conclusive stage of recovery is one of self responsibility whereupon the now former target of emotional abuse takes back her power by taking responsibility for her own issues choices and the predicaments she finds herself in from hereon in this book and an exceptional one at that is for those who are ready to be more responsible and break the pattern of emotionally abusive relationships in their lives !

on becoming a gardener i am reviewing this book because i read it and it s one of my all time favorites i m a fairly successful gardener people stop on my street and admire my flowers many friends and acquaintances ask for advice i wish i had written this book it says what i want to say learning to garden is a process of bringing forth what already exists inside you one learns to garden through trial and error and what works in one garden may not work in another cookie cutter directions simply don t work and when one follows them and fails one feels like a failure nollman writes about gardening in his part of the world which is not like your part of the world or my part of the world but the thoughts he shares transcend these differences there are two major approaches to gardening one organic spiritual and esthetic the other nonorganic and ugly to be content nollman says all you need is love and an organic garden nothing works if you work against nature probably the reason our forebears were thrown out of eden why we garden helped me maintain the link between the inner gardener i was born to be and gaia 
zany and smart i cannot but think of quotunder the net quot and smile and it is for this reason that i m so endeared to murdoch s gem of book the last time i really laughed out loud while reading a novel was don delillo s quotwhite noise quot behind all the zany situations and comedic characterization is a smart strangely gratifying take on life highly recommended 
excellent book good information on the subject especially for a newbie it offers some new ideas for the seasoned prof but don t expect too much may be lacking on intense analysis but i reccomend it for all 
the conservative s bible kirk s book is supposedly the bible of conservatives not neo conservatives but conservatives he sets up the long standing debate between the french and voltaie and the english using burke as it s spokesman supposedly kirk would limit the vote have a professional class of government officials reduce if not eliminate most taxes and let each individual strive for success this is the basic mantra of classical conservatives and is all well and good as far as it goes but only a few of the many ever succeed this way one of the surprises is how young kirk was when this book was written it s as if he had some inspiration for on high probably not or was cherry picking history probably closer to the truth after reading this book i had a better understanding of where the conservatives are coming from althohgh i still don t understand why an obscure royalist politician from the th century should be their flag bearer royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the us although we seem to flirt with it from time to time conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy as we currently have in the us they would rather rely on accidents of birth cronyism and college organizations to select administrators rather than people who have succeeded in other venues a very informative albeit frightening book 
great reference with realistic pictures while i was impressed with the exhaustive yet lively informationprovided by dr carolyn male perhaps most important to tomatogrowers are the realistic pictures instead of photos of perfect tomatoes you see the imperfections associated witheach variety i e if the tomato is prone to cracking greenshoulders or catfacing she tells you this and providespictures ! two years ago i was kicking myself for producing oddlyshaped and sometimes ugly heirloom tomatoes sure wish i had thisbook back then if you plan to grow heirloom tomatoes buy this book 
fiction that reads like a memoir ha jin war trash a novel new york pantheon books pagesisbn war trash refers to the human detritus of war the throwaways the men still living but accorded no honor in spite of their performance as soldiers this is the story of one among a number of these men a chinese soldier imprisoned in an american prisoner ofwar camp in korea during the korean war his rare english language skills and the opportunities they afford him to interact with a wide range of inmates and officers as interpreter elevate him to a position unlikely for an otherwise ordinary soldier required to fight for the communists in the chinese infantry though not a party member he is nevertheless driven to return to the mainland at the close of the war in order to re join his mother and fiance personally apolitical he is caught between dissent and conformity faced with the choice of repatriating in red china where he will not be welcomed by the party or joining the nationalists in taiwan with no opportunity of seeing his mother and fiance again the language is a bit stiff but this helps the book read more like a memoir than a novel though most characters are fictional events and specific details are not meticulous research and attention to detail in the descriptions of incidents of horror on the battlefield in the camp hospital and in the camp compounds and a deep understanding of the political twists and deceptions that create the narrator s dilemma lend the narrative a level of realism not frequently found in a work of fiction ha jin is a native of china educated in the u s and currently an english professor at boston university and an author of several novels and books of poetry and short stories war trash won for its author the pen faulkner award ha jin has also won the national book award the asian american literary award the flannery o connor award for short fiction and the pen hemingway award this is the first of his books i ve read i look forward to more

ethiopia and the dergue my family spent months in ethiopia during my active duty military service in a home just a block off the road from his imperial majesty s haile selassie i palace and the bole airport in addis ababa that was from february of until january of the american community was concerned about the stability of the government there when the emperor would eventually go the way of all mankind him hsi died after we left probably suffocated by the new rulers after the dergue took over the country many of us wondered what has happened during the intervening years this book tells the story from the memories of one student who lived and suffered through those perilous times it s very interesting to anyone who ever lived there and appears authentic

this book deserves much more attention than it has gotten i read this book several years ago having had no prior interest in the shroud and found the presentation of how the image was made to be pretty reasonable and well demonstrated i am moved now to write this review because i recently read second messiah which criticizes this book and which postulates that the image is that of a real human laid on the shroud which i think cannot be true because among other reasons the image of the long hair of the back of the head would not run straight down the figure s back as it actually appears on the shroud instead as the body was laid down the hair would first dangle to the cloth and then as the head lowered to the cloth the hair would crumple underneath the head as anyone with long hair knows happens if you lie down after a shower this book turin shroud describes a physical process involving a camera obscura and a primitive emulsion on the cloth producing a photographic image i can t speak to the leonardo theory or the priory of sion material they include since i don t follow nor much care about such conjectures but that material even if wrong doesn t impeach the physical theory of image production as to motivation it seems reasonable that someone would try to create such a religious object as christ s shroud in order to attract pilgrims and donations and may have stumbled on the process to create this image there is another long review on this site that goes into more detail i ve read this review and i generally agree with its approach 
practical suggestions in every chapter i found practical suggestions in each chapter a useful resource to help us round out our fund raising program with uncertainties in the washington dc mail due to anthrax we are especially interested in increasing visits and gifts through our web site this book will help us move towards that goal
