stars for content stars for poor writting absolutely terrible so many good points all jumbled up it felt like it was written by a grade english student trying to impress a university crowd the flow was difficult to grasp and the book lacked that finished up maybe she should have spent more time in editing there were so many grammatical errors shira really you can convey your message without vulgarity your book tries to cross the lines of financial insight and a smut paperback through a little sex in there and you got a daniel steel novel really people there are so many better books out there with the same information in them try total money makeover by dave ramsey or your money or your life by joe dominguez save your hardback dollars for something a little more professional and hey shira please do another revision after you have spent about months cleaning this sh up as you would have put it 
opportunity lost i found this book rhetorical and in some areas misleading while i can sympathise with the authors attempts in trying to make sense of the management problem that afflicts industry and government their resort to claiming that all problems will be fixed through the application of six change forces is pure technique drivel to be fair the concepts in the book are now becoming old reprint but this does not distance it from deserved criticism the last thing that the world needs is a dialectic that is predicated upon the cult of the leader leader power and a reverence to the ability of information technology to provide a managerial communications fix their concentration upon investor power is correct but for the wrong reasons investors are not good at judging customer value and their influence in redirecting customer centric corporate direction through a compliant ceo has to be viewed with scepticism do not misunderstand me i am not a managerial apologist in concurrence with the authors i also believe that bureaucratic managerialism is inefficient and needs reduction however the methods by which i would achieve this goal is not as socially disruptive as those endorsed by the authors i e through rampant dismissals i can understand why the authors state we do not have the abswers p to the unemployment dilemma the authors focus upon the customer and upon simpliicity are some of this book s redeeming features until the authors start espousing the merits of outsourcing and the tired neo conservative polemic that privatisation is a better economic model than public ownership outsourcing is only advantageous when core competencies are not lost the book s tenet revolves around the non managerialism so would it not make sense to outsource management nowhere in the book is this stated the latter privatisation public ownership debate only has currency because we have been and still are existing in a flawed neoclassical economic milieu that by historical circumstances has ruled western society since the time of adam smith it is a philosophy that professes a primacy of the individual over community perhaps it is time to review this economic underpinning and start questioning the neoclassical economic ceteris paribus assumptions see page inherent in neoclassical static economic models especially in these times when sustainability issues iso iso etc have become paramount this latter exercise i think should provide the authors with a better avenue along which to proceed i am convinced that the chapter heading is prophetic i do not believe that this book is sufficiently detailed to provide the world with a blueprint that promises a revolution that has not happened 
boring and confusing i have derived many hours of pleasure from this author my favorite is ivanhoe i wouldn t recommend this one though it is boring and confusing 
we were unable to use in our schools because of the content we ordered this book on the good reputation of the author but were very disappointed in the author s portrayal of witches we are unable to use this book in our schools 
don t buy it it a waste of money this book is so lame i regret every minute i spent reading it 
sholarly and deeply considered not i am so appalled that i contributed even one penny to this blatently anti semitic history denying xenophobe i only wish i could rate this a zero this book incites hatred and paranoia against everything jewish he buys into every nazi and neo nazi theory denying the ethnic and historic origins of the jewish people he refers to the holocaust as the socalled holocaust jews are simply khazars from russia who are removing native palestinians from their land yes i was already aware of this theory that has been amply and roundly refuted he makes the patently absurd claim that christianity is the only religion that represents the old testament creed of yahweh and makes no effort to prove it he only goes into talmudic examinations which are totally one sided of course i doubt the authenticity of many of his talmudic quotes at all but i am aware that the talmud contains everything and its opposite he doesn t bother quoting the opposite sentiments i only wish someone had warned me about the content of this book before i bought it i only hope that people will realize this author does not represent what true christians believe this guy is scary 
some good ideas but mostly gobbleygook taftp has its moments but i dont think this book was the godsend others make it out to be an example of a good point is the author s notion of optimizing the cycle length to find the best d to use for a particular security that s a good read the next chapter suggests drawing oodles of trendlines on a chart and looking for intersections if you draw enough lines on a chart you are bound to find one that supports what you believe i just ddnt buy her premise at all some concepts that can be described quickly are laboriously drawn out pages dedicated to the dangers of looking at small charts where data can be compressed is pages too much other commentators have talked about sophistication and complexity as virtues of the book i disagree complex doesnt mean better simplicity breeds success remember this book gets wordy and its ideas are sometimes hard to understand that doesnt make it a better book nor does it make its ideas more credible the cmt has put this on their required reading list but i wouldnt give that too much weight they have been criticized that their syllabus isnt quantitative enough so they needed to incorporate something like this besides half the book isnt tested for cmt lastly like far too many technical analysis books there is a lot of this makes total sense looking backwards about this book had you bought in at this signal which became obvious in you would have made a lot of money rather than shlep through taftp there are better books out there trading sytems and methods by kaufman comes to mind 
a waste of time i don t believe i ve ever read such an unhelpful organizing book much of the book is spent on describing the assumed state of the problem rather than on offering solutions to the problem do i really need half a chapter to tell me that my kitchen is disorganized if i didn t already know that why was i reading the kitchen chapter the remainder of the stuff organization chapters as opposed to the time management chapters in the first section of the book consists of lists of tips unfortunately the vast majority of these tips are things that most of us could have figured out on our own write down what you re running out of before you run out of it we don t necessarily all do this but i don t think we needed help coming up with the concept moreover most of the methods the author recommends will only work well for a small segment of the population that is those who don t actually struggle with disorganization but who have simply not gotten around to getting organized before for example the method given for organizing a room is to dump everything into the middle of the room from all of the drawers shelves etc and start from there for some people this may work great for many of us it would result in being immediately overwhelmed crashing and burning when barely into the project ending up with a much larger mess than what we started with and possibly giving up on any further attempts to get organized besides the lack of helpful instruction offered i did not care for the author s tone attitude the entire thing especially the first section made me feel as though i was constantly being beaten over the head the author continually railed against the excuses i was supposedly making for not getting organized and why i needed to just suck it up and do it well contrary to the author s perception i had every intent of sucking it up and doing the job that s why i bought the book and was reading it she also operates on the assumption that everyone has loads of disposable cash lying around and that everyone s lifestyle is or should be like hers when have you ever used more than one paper bag in a month how about when we had the newspaper delivered every day and we used paper bags for holding the newspapers and taking them to the recycling point does the author truly believe that nobody anywhere has a use for more than one paper bag per month she recommends paying someone else to do nearly every imaginable task and her not socreative solutions to most organizing problems are to just buy such andsuch a gizmo if i had plenty of money to buy every organizing gizmo on the market i would not be disorganized in the first place finally she routinely discourages respect for the other people in our lives if someone is late for dinner she says don t heat up his dinner because his own poor time management is not your problem so if my hard working husband is late for dinner because a job took longer than anticipated i should leave him to fend for himself because it s technically not my problem i would skip this book in favor of others whose authors are a little more knowledgeable and gracious 
a popularity contest for ideas shermer s book is an attempt to classify various lines of research into science nonscience and borderlands science but he follows no rigorous methodology instead he subjectively classifies various theories practices and lines of research into his three categories based upon how popular certain theories are among mainstream scientists and how much the theories practices and lines of research appeal to his narrow scientific fundamentalism there really is no need for this book the celebrated philosopher karl popper brilliantly solved the problem of the demarcation between science and philosophy ideology and nonsense decades ago and his work has been endorsed by scientists from einstein to hawkings the criterion is testability scientific theories are theories that are capable of being tested by experiment or observation our theories can never be proven correct although a single counter instance can prove them wrong one can sum up popper s famous demarcation between science and non science by saying that the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability accordingly theories that are not falsifiable in principle cannot claim to be scientific and so belong to metaphysics ideology or pseudo sciencepoppers criterion of testability provides a clear logical way of separating science from ideology and philosophy hence string theory is not science but philosophy as it currently makes no predictions capable of being tested popper argued that marxism started out as a scientific theory it predicted that capitalism would lead to increasing misery among the masses and then be overthrown by revolution and replaced by socialism it also predicted that this would occur first in the most technically developed countries when the so called worker s revolution first occurred in then backward and agrarian russia supporters of the theory did not accept this as a refutation the theory was simply modified so that it became immune to falsification in other words marxism was transformed into an ideology the universal property of scientific theories cannot be stressed enough a scientific theory cannot be merely speculation about a particular fact or an isolated event because nothing new and non trivial can be predicted from such a speculation this point has to be stressed because it has caused a great deal of confusion among philosophers and historians of science for example shermer writes in the book poppers attempt to solve the problem of demarcation between science and nonscience begins to break down in the borderlands of knowledge consider the theory that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos if we find out by making radio contact through the seti program then the theory will have been proven absolutely but how could this theory ever be falsified shermers mistake is his categorization of the statement extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos as a scientific theory it is no such thing it is merely speculation about a specific fact from which no non trivial predictions follow for instance it does not follow from this that such life would want to contact us would share our values would be friendly toward us and so forth it is no more a scientific theory than the statement there are white swans somewhere on the lake such statements about specific factual matters can indeed be confirmed even proven beyond all reasonable doubt but this is only because they are not universal statements scientific theories are universal statements about how facts fit together and from such universal statements follow predictions about specific facts so from the universal statement all swans are white follows the prediction that the next swans we will see on the lake will be white the former is a simple scientific theory the latter a prediction about a specific fact that follows from the theory and that may used to test the theory note that shermer would have formulated his idea as a scientific theory if he had stated it in a universal testable form such as life arises quickly wherever there is water and an average temperature above freezing and given a few billion years some of this life will become recognizably intelligent this is a universal statement that relates specific facts to each other can be used to make predictions about how much intelligent life exists elsewhere in our galaxy and can be tested at least in principle by sending probes to planets in which conditions for life appear to have been appropriate for a few billion years if intelligent life is not found then the theory is refuted and must either be abandoned or modified it is precisely at the borderlands of science that popper s criterion works so well parapsychology for instance most certainly is a science to the extent that it makes predictions capable of being tested but shermer gives little attention to this field as it conflicts with his ideology of materialism shermer is not a scientist but an historian and as an historian he has no excuse for being woefully ignorant of the history of science at one time reports that rocks sometimes fall from the sky what we know call meteorites were dismissed by most scientists as superstitious fantasies the idea that the continents could drift was ridiculed for decades even x rays were considered an elaborate hoax those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them and shermer has simply not learned that popularity of ideas cannot be used as a guide to separate science from nonsense but shermer is an intellectual lightweight who is simply out of his league when discussing the philosophy of science if you want to read something really magnificent on the subject i recommend replies to my critics in the philosophy of karl popper part ii edited by paul arthur schilpp 
not as good as others here suggest the maverick guide to bermuda didn t meet the high expectations set by other reviews here there isn t a whole lot to the book it isn t full of secret suggestions as others suggested instead there is much on the obvious basics and little beyond our family did enjoy the chapter discussing some of the colorful history of bermuda but otherwise i regret the purchase i suspect one of the other guidebooks would have been a better choice i do recommend bermuda 
this book is out of date the book is years out of date donald writes brocas region and wernickes region are convenient fictions the truth being that aphasia can be caused by wide variety of legions that spare these areas while occasionally the complete loss of these areas will spare language function altogether provided the adjacent white matter and basal ganglia are not damaged the implication is that higher level integration appears to be fluid and plastic in its underlying anatomy and the anatomy looks modular through out the current consensus refutes this position 
lots of fill little thrill as a piece of entertainment this book falls flat way flat there is a story here but mundane sub plots including the love story are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book i found myself skipping pages lots of them to get to the point overall very disappointing 
warning this review is for the audio edition no stars is the true rating of a silly conversation with an old guy who cannot talk the level of the meanings and ideas it is less than of a child in the first classes of elementary school i feel very stupid i paid money for this garbage 
oh do enlighten us john yeah i happen to agree that the bush administration is incompetent bush spends like a drunken democrat teddy k and he s even slower than democrat john conyers watching grass grow is more exciting than listening to conyers string out a simple sentence for five minutes i do give bush credit for nominating roberts and alito to the supreme court maybe they can marginalize the aclu witch ginsberg who was foisted on us by the pathetic zipper challenged clintoon dean comes across like a jailhouse snitch so sneaky the way he ratted out nixon for glory let s face it a little break in to the dem headquarters to snoop around is nothing compared to marxist hillary hiring the hapless livingstone to secretly peruse hundreds of confidential fbi files on hill s enemies and they said nixon was paranoid then there s bill clintoon selling secrets to china and pardoning drug runners like dan lassiter and neer dowells like mark rich and on and on ad infinitum dean is just insipid the way he lurks on the fringes waiting to capitalize on the misfortunes and screwups of others the recycled title sounds so self serving hey somebody look at me ! i m the selfless heroic sneak who exposed nixon and i need attention buy my book and line my pockets so blatantly opportunistic all imho 
unnecessary harsh corrections i was intrigued by the title of this book since i come into contact with all sorts of dogs regularly and am often asked advice about issues like possession guarding dog ondog aggression etc however the advice in this book is by no means anything i would ever pass on most issues are dealt with by correcting the dog harshly shaking him dragging him by the leash and similar awful methods the author s cure for a dog that growls and snaps from under the bed is to daftly drag him out by the lead and if he happens to bang his head on the way out so much the better ! she advises owners of dogs with fear aggression towards strangers to severly reprimand the dog with voice and leash corrections every time he becomes agitated around another person this is a ridiculous way to help your dog and will most likely only make the aversion worse i noticed that ms benjamin has also written a book that claims to use positive training methods but unless her philosophy has changed from one book to the other i would not recommend any of her material to anyone else there are plenty of truly humane training guides out there don t waste your money on this 
a major disservice to the book the book the lost continent is an amazing captivating read bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions this cd totally kills that first of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute sometimes to the point where you can t understand him and second they abridged the crap out of it cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire second half of the book ! while the book is amazing this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
does this man have an agenda you bet he does ! if you want to read a book by a notorious homophobic right wing friend of dr laura then go right ahead know your authors if i could i d have given him zero stars blah 
come back later even though this is a popular version of the theory with the considerable advantage of being by einstein himself it is not so easy as the presentation may imply einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high school knowledge it might be true in his time but nowadays the book demands a longer study in physics i offer myself as an example i m a literature student in post graduation level and simply couldn t grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points his reasoning is also obscure in many passages what are really those galilean coordinates perhaps these details seem self evident for professional readers but they are not for the general public the implied target of the book in brief einstein didn t succeed completely in his attempt at popularization 
not for bread makers i bought this book doing a search with two phrases whole grain and bread machine the book promises to easily convert her recipies from oven to bredmachine she only gives a few pages that vaguely tell to modify the recipies but not ecactly how judging from previous reviews this book must have some merit it is not for a bread machine owner that likes simple and direct instructions 
horrible book the only great thing about this book is its small size and thats about it the text doesn t do a very good job of explaining the ideas and concepts say you are given certain parts of an equation it doesn t really show you how to use to components to solve for the right number instead it gives you a wonderful general overview of an idea that is minimal in explanation i m almost at the point of flipping out because the lack of explanations and i m only on chapter 
mega flaw in mega best seller there is a huge flaw in this book below is a quote when you make any choice ask yourself two things first of all what are the consequences of this choice that i m making in your heart you will immediately know what these are secondly will this choice that i m making now bring happiness to me and to those around me if the answer is yes then go ahead with that choice if the answer is no if that choice will bring distress either to you or to those around you then don t make that choice it s as simple as that if you follow this advice you would stall any sort of personal growth deepak is a great man and has helped many people but if you are interested in consicous choice making then you can know that this book will not help you and choose not to buy it 
interesting information but poor commentary i m the type of person who is interested in the story after the story so i was anxious to read gettysburg memory market and an american shrine by jim weeks while the facts that he presents are quite interesting the book bogged down with his sometimes totally inappropriate social commentary weeks begins before the civil war when genteel society spent their leisure time in parks and cemeteries when confederate and union troops converge on gettysburg in what became the battle that changed the course of the war gettysburg would never be the same within days hordes of people traveled to gettysburg for a number of reasons some came to assist the injured and dying or to seek out missing loved ones others came to see the battlefield and to search for relics this became the beginning of the evolution of gettysburg as a national shrine weeks does intensive research on how this little hamlet of people became the most visited national park service battlefield the process was not without some growing pains as different groups vied for control and locals tried to cash in on the tourist trade the author details how the face of tourism changed from visiting veterans to black groups celebrating emancipation to family vacationers and finally to reenactors the means of traveling also changed from trains to cars but this book would have been much better if weeks had just stuck to the facts i do agree with some of weeks criticisms after just returning from a trip to gettysburg i believe there is just a little too much tourist trap honky tonk to be found there i also believe that the battle of gettysburg should not be celebrated as much as honored and after looking at my fellow tourists it does appear that gettysburg appeals to mainly white men unfortunately i feel the author goes way overboard he claims that gettysburg has actually become worse than disney world for sanitized entertainment actually the national park service has done much in recent decades to make the battlefields more authentic weeks heaps criticism on almost every group of visitors and is especially unrelenting about the recent reenactment trend he claims white males have taken up this pastime because of the male dominated society lost to them since feminism brought women into the male world of work and because of the competing minority culture weeks is especially stuck on the class system and seems to lament the loss of genteel society in fact he uses the word genteel ad nauseam on page genteel appears times ! just to provide a brief example of part of the first paragraph thanks in part to the railroad the genteel resort of the immediate postwar years gave way to one that included a broad cross section of america genteel and plebeian black and white separate spaces catered to both genteel and working class tastes yet the genteel accommodated the plebeian while the genteel agenda for constructing a park much like a rural cemetery so if you re a hardcore history fan and you re interested in gettysburg you might find some use for gettysburg memory market and an american shrine if not i don t think it s worth the read 
great book bad edition penguin this is my favorite book i ve been through three different copies a now out ofprint classics club copy the loeb classics library copy with the original latin facing the english text and this penguin edition the penguin is by far the worst of those three among its faults is the fact that it s translated into prose which makes for an easier read but in the end dumbs down the text and reduces it in beauty and while the footnotes are sometimes informative most of them i find insulting to both the reader s and lucretius s intelligence go with the loeb or some other edition chances are it s better than this one 
crimes of omission disappointingly this uneven collection focuses on relatively marginal writers eg minette walters instead of elizabeth peters and has odd emphases does the reader really care in each essay about the religious convictions real or speculated upon of every single author charlotte macleod is noted only as a biographer and other ignored authors are sharyn mccrumb mary stewart jane haddam dell shannon oh the list is endless 
perverted i think that wayne did a humiliating job with this book he mostly focused on the things that warhol did in his lifetime you know what i think i think that wayne had a crush on andy himself because the are both and wayne seems to like to talk about andy s 
nothing insightful just plain common sense there wasn t profound thought through out the whole book i finished in thirty minutes 
very pedantic tomb about two worthless pieces of ice the author and new horizons principal investigator alan stern is obviously excited ie worse than a creationist zealot about pluto and charon but he doesn t fairly tackle the other side of the debate who really cares yes scientists can make up reasons why the american government should waste millions of dollars to send a spacecraft to pluto charon and the kuiper belt but what startling science will be advanced by two pieces of ice that we already have a pretty good understanding of after voyager s trip past neptune s moon triton in even if we lack a fundamental understanding of so called ice dwarf class planets is the extraordinary cost really worth the benefit any scientist will admit that it is extremely unlikely that we will find life on pluto or charon can we finally solve the debate about whether pluto is a planet or a kbo wow what a great use of over million i think that stern and other planetary society members need to focus on more important and less selfish world problems such as genocide and starvation in somalia or al qaeda or at the very least spend the money on a worthy objective such as sending another craft to jupiter s moon europa a place where we might actually find life 
it s a quotgottahaveitquot book when sandra says quoteverythingquot she means it as a professional speaker i found this book to be a terrific quothelpmatequot for my business ! this quota to z quot guide truly is a quotcompletequot and indispensable guide for every professional speaker author and more 
class mothers lacks class this is a very superficial shallow juvenile novel seemingly written in haste to take advantage of the motherhood boomlet and the success of books like the nannie diaries i would not recommend it at all 
home winemaking step bystep the book contains some interesting winemaking tips unfortunately the quality of said information gets lost in the twisted tangle of grammatically challenged pages two stars for the information and zero stars for the presentation 
too abstract this book is full of excellent information with tools and methodologies for future systems analyst work but the information is so abstract there are no real practical examples in any of the chapters which would make it easier for me to grasp it not to mention help with the assigned homework unlike most college subjects and textbooks that have three or more examples at the beginning of a chapter this book has little if any at all 
patient of ellen cutler we all know that close friends relatives or colleagues who have something to gain write the stars critics they are really objective this book is a star and should be taken off the market i can t believe it is still being sold it is misleading it taps into the thousands of people vulnerability who are so desperate to find a cure for themselves or their young children they are ready to try anything i was one of these people i bought the book read it sounded promising so i made an appointment to see dc cutler i was her patient for some time but got no relief i spend quite a bit of money on the products she wanted me to take but nothing changed ellen cutler is a charlatan in my opinion she actually laid me to believe her treatment cured me from my egg white allergy i believed her at first but the following week i had a conversation with her assistant while getting another treatment she said mrs you were never allergic to egg white wow ! i could not believe it i still gave a chance to mrs cutler treatment for a few more weeks but no results no change it was clear i was wasting my time and my money so i stop seeing her now several years later although still allergic to egg yolk cat and dog i am feeling better as far as my asthma goes because i finally got out of a years abusive marriage 
informative and deeply flawed i realize that all the previous reviewers are from other parts of the world and i am from the part of the world so peculiarly described by mr meredith and maybe i know better and maybe i am biased but i think mr meredith has decided to do a powerful portrait in black if i may say so of the whole of africa and given that his book is almost entirely descriptive the portrait is powerful enough indeed the review from the gentleman from bangladesh states the ultimate conclusion that one might have if one ignores the fact that africa is still pretty much colonized and that it is not so much that the whites are gone as that they are hidden only their helping hand is made visible in any case my overall impression is that the book is very informative on many of the crimes and horrors that have plagued africa since the inception of the colonial era with a concentration on the post colonial period but totally neglects the best programs of social and political emancipation which by the way can be symbolized by mandela and senghor only from a western point of view from an african point of view mandela has not had the chance to be a real leader and senghor was a puppet of french neo colonialism the real leaders were people like modibo keita thomas sankara seyni kountche in the francophone countries that i know best the author also ignores the economic structure of today s africa which is only beginning to shift from the colonial polarization to the emergence of an internal market not without success in some cases and tragedies in others i think if the author had been less the journalist that he is by profession in order to illuminate his narrative with structural analyses he would have given a more complete vision of the continent and one that would have made more sense of its evolution furthemore living in africa one does not necessarily have the sense of violent decline that is described here i am from a country which didn t know a single year of civil war or ethnic brawl there have been three coups d etat which on the whole i think were beneficial to the country we now have a democratic system i don t like our politicians i don t think they have intelligent designs for the country and they aren t at all above corruption we have dire economic problems but life there is peaceful a bit drowsy and has its many charms i should add that i am from the better off section of society and that might taint my vision but really i do not have the impression of living in the hell pit of bloody feuds and utter corruption i am and have so far never had the occasion to bribe a civil servant in my country although i know very well that corruption exists that emerges from this book and i d venture to say that many africans out of the warring areas will think that the book is a bit much my general experience is that countries differ a lot despite the kind of uniformity that mr meredith sought to impose on us in this book i won t be happy in nigeria for instance i liked ghana i am not desperate i think we need peace and time and the kind of help that works on structures education and health not on symptoms corruption and poverty mr meredith book isn t helpful in that sense and that s why although i found it informative i never recommend it 
overated book while some of the book is interesting it is more geared for the beginner in investing a lot of the issues brought up are nothing more than common sense i read it in a couple of days and felt let down by the simplistic approach to investing problems and the suggested solutions 
one of the worst novels i have finished this year maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender but by the reviews here all by women i can see that jance writes to that crowd her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible if you want to spend pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then pages later start uncovering her first clue the insulin bottle jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time if you want a good mystery read coben crais patterson or michael connely 
easy read a very visual novel could have gone deeper as a debut this novel is noteworthy and the author paints a highly visual picture of the africa she knows to me the disappointment with the novel was the author s inability to go deeper it stayed very surface level with me reads almost like a young adult novel also deals with the subject of physical abuse so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it 
i don t agree with the other reviewers i was not convinced having tried mr x it had such a must have look about it and found it seriously wanting again the main character is not persuasive enough he actually sounds like a complete jerk maybe it would have been more convincing written in third person but as is not as bad as mr x which was a total dissapointment but definititely much ado about very little 
disgusting the only book i ve ever read that i tore up and threw in the trash when i was finished if this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there s something seriously wrong with the world this is a tragic sad grotesque disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world when a child is damaged it is never uplifting whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes this book is sickening don t buy it there are no animals only pain and death 
one star is as low as i could rate it really it should be less had this book been the work of a novice sci fi author it would have never seen print the story follows the life of one lazarus long a character who is easy to see is only a thinly veiled cover for the author himself lazarus is a character who is so convinced of his own personal superiority that late in his very long life he travels back in time so that he can father himself as further example of his self superiority he had himself cloned into twins of the opposite sex twins that he later has sexual relations with even the conscience mind of the artificially intelligent computer that controlled his space craft transferred itself into the engineered body of a woman so that it too could have sexual relations with lazarus to make it further insulting the sexual advances of those characters is not of lazarus choosing but rather of their free will indeed lazarus fends off the sexual advances of his cloned twins until they reach the age of consent this reveals how shallow the author feels the drives and motives of others to be the story follows the life of lazarus long through a series of flashbacks as the character struggles to find a reason to continue his existence most of the flashbacks deal with how the character traveled about the universe starting colonies on untamed worlds each of these mini stories is an equally self aggrandizing yarn about how lazarus fathered virtually every child on the planet while single handedly delivering the worlds he founded from lawlessness ignorance and barbarism among these gems are such classic lines as there is only one way to comfort a widow implying that the answer was sex yes among these stories there are a few meaningful bits of wisdom such as heinlein s list of what things a man should be able to do to save you the grief of reading the book just to get to it i ll quote it for you below a man should be able to change a diaper plan an invasion butcher a hog conn a ship design a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall set a bone comfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate act alone solve equations analyze a new problem pitch manure program a computer cook a tasty meal fight efficiently and die gallantly specialization is for insects robert a heinleincertainly i can agree with that these are abilities that every man should endevour to have to make himself complete but they are not the exclusive domain of men unfortunately this bit of wisdom is so embedded in mounds of garbage that reveal heinlein s low esteem for women it is not otherwise worth excavating one comes away from this book knowing that the author felt that women are worth nothing beyond serving as receptacles for a man s sexual needs throughout the book examples are given of how a man should be able to do all of the above while women conversely are scarcely credited with the ability to do any of those things that this book was ever nominated for an award is a blemish on human history 
who cares a good story with strong characters lures the reader s imagination inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next this is not one of those stories it s not a bad book by any means shining moments appear however taita is a character hard with which to sympathize all the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity did i mention it s predictable you should have expected that pick up a clavell or jennings instead this is soap opera history 
huge disappointment it s hard to explain exactly how horrible i think the female heroine was written in this book i can not believe any female would ever act as she had in her position this heroine had no brain in her head she got turned on by a trespasser rubbing himself up against a window naked yet thinking about how he was such a disgusting pervert understanding that this girl only has a quarter of a brain in her head but to not call the police even though she thought about it was idiotic and that includes her thinking she was safer with her carrying the sword and then blaming someone else for her killing a person this heroine had a mentality of a year old i m normally a fan of richard laymon s books but this is one i definitely could have done with out the two books i have read where he has female heroines have just been horrible 
same as the blog but fun if you haven t read it ditto another reader s observations on this if you ve been reading along with the blog these past few years the book is an unfortunate duplicate or i should say is duplicate but unfortunately that extra is rather like the extra two minutes on some director s cut of a movie doesn t change the story doesn t change the book itself and you really could have kept it out but guess that s what i get for not looking closely before i bought it aside from that if you haven t read the blog the book is fun nothing earthshattering just leisurely and running occasionally to voyeuristic 
the house is not a home run the pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning i ve never read a danielle steel before and i won t be speeding to the nearest barnes noble to get another one other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition i picked up on that before reading the reviews there have also been suggestions that steel needs an editor for gawd s sake she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world ! they must have hundreds of editors but perhaps just perhaps they are intimidated by the prolific ms steel then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility nobody could be as eccentric as stanley and run a powerful and megarich conglomerate there s no way a house as large as the house in the center of san francisco no less could ever be bought and restored for the oh sohappy ending is as predictable as the setting s weather ms steel has made a lot of money from her readers they deserve better than this 
have not read the book and no desire to i just have something to say to those arguing on this review page wicca is a peaceful religion however just because someone is peaceful does not mean they are not allowed to protect themselves i am a person who actively studies all the religions i have come across wiccans believe religion is a very sacred and personal thing hence they do not actively pursue conversion of others they mostly only speak of it to others who are generally interested in learning while i understand that this author believes he is helping to keep children away from a dangerous practice may i remind everyone that this is only one man s opinion these wiccans and pagans are not for the most part flaming christianity what they desire is for others to be tolerant of their paths the last thing that any parent wants is to be terrified of sending their child to school one day and have the child come home after being physically or mentally attacked or have the child come home so depressed they actually commit suicide which has happened google the topic or not have the child come home at all this happens in so many societies because of fear pagans want to be safe just like everyone else and no child is responsible for what their parent believes unless that child is old enough to make the decision to believe the same blessingslone wol 
everyone loves una or the navel gazer a mary sue i truly wanted to like this book after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i d feared but downright enjoyable in addition i d heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last alas it was all down hill from there overall this is one of the worst books i ve ever forced myself to finish this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack author of two other published novels and a short story collection director of a university level creative writing program long term teacher of writing and holder of a ph d in same all to considerable critical acclaim she should be correcting and grading failing garbage like this not producing it so what went wrong how did this novel end up so awful the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things length if brevity is the soul of wit this novel s witlessness is easily explained at pages interesting number that this novel is about three times as long as it should have been it would seem that to some extent like melville before her naslund confused length with importance but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self parody somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing with a meat axe or a chainsaw the name dropping one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures but if badly handled these encounters can un suspend disbelief and downright offend they are badly handled here an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid nineteenth century new england and those she doesn t utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund s peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne one or two of these developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude as it is it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor or the self awarenessthe politics even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing however naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day from slavery to whaling from feminism to free love from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled all without consequence or even criticism this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today which is to say none the anti christian bigotry there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish the bigoted the future apostate or the mentally ill it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi religious idea of the time except christianity the farfetched scenarios i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi lesbian encounter after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal minded aunt and uncle encounters two young men who both fall in love with her disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them successfully avoids detection is sunk by a whale survives by committing cannibalism marries the surviving young man after he goes insane and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians leaving her free to marry captain ahab una never really marries anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes things don t get more realistic in the second half which includes una s clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale riiiight the mary sue however the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a mary sue that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader a more realistic main character might have saved it una never learns anything from her life s too manytobebelieved experiences because she already knows everything she doesn t change because she is already perfect she doesn t have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn t receive any and she doesn t have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides una had her reasons and they were very good ones you can be sure the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it i feel like i ve just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom with the door locked 
very disappointing sophisticated knitting book i had very high hopes for this book after reading all of the good reviews so maybe that s why i was so very disappointed in the patterns it does have a couple of nice pillow designs but for a book that claims to be for sophisticated tastes the wine wraps and purses are downright tacky and the trivets pot holders welted baskets and hanger cover are all straight from your grandma s knitting books then there s a host of projects that look good but are really just very simple designs that use expensive yarns to make their statement replacing the yarns with less expensive versions as i usually am forced to do that have different textures and shading patterns would effectively ruin the look of the pattern since that look is almost entirely supplied by the yarn itself those patterns include most of the patterns for throws and adult s clothes also the slippers for anyone look like baby booties if you re looking for a sophisticated slipper pattern the argyle ones in weekend knitting are really great i kept the book because i want to make the bath set even that i don t think is really something special but i already bought bath salts such for a gift basket so i ll toss in the knitted bath set as an accompaniment 
how many vt students are buying this book john lott is a first class wack job his research is questionable and he even invented a person a woman named mary rosh to defend him on various websites and blogs how sad is that hey john fyi guns kill innocent people 
verbose i used this book for the cornell econ course a calculus based intro to microeconomics the professor taught everything in lecture so that the book was used only as a supplement i read part of the book and found that it is too verbose and repetitive the author could have explained everything in less than half of the book the exercises are not helpful moreover this little book is sold for more than a dollars not worth the money at all 
when does it kick in if a story doesn t hook by the middle of chapter there are other books to open books that kick in by page thank heaven i bought time bomb because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling i could not even finish chapter i d read something once by jonathan kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction i can t remember what it was sigh i don t see where these rave reviews are coming from the book is so boring also the racist meanies i saw lurching up over the horizon as well as being hackneyed and ho hum were unrealistic even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn t picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting wetback and greaser not even in wacky california i shouldn t think 
compelling moments but disappointing overall i can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book though i was personally not bothered by it there were several things that did trouble me however the abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person i felt separated from the characters especially claire and more or less ceased to care about her her behavior on the expedition didn t feel like the person that was established in the first two thirds of the book either the many parallels between magda and claire felt a little contrived her quest to trace her family s history was compelling in and of itself and didn t need to have those clairvoyant elements the ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting for a truly fascinating real theory about the ripper murders read alan moore s from hell absolutely no resolution on what happened to nick and christian the jack claire affair was just creepy 
very little sailing tons of social commentary i admit i am a resident of the south alabama to be exact but when i purchased this book i sincerely wanted to read a story about sailing for a year in the bahamas sadly this book is more about a spoiled couple that spends about of the time telling you how scared they are about every aspect of the trip and of the time criticizing the social conditions of the south as they travel down the icw on the east coast the other of the time is spent talking about random ideas with a few sentences of the sailing trip they are supposedly on by page i was tired of their liberal slant on a part of the us they claim to be from message to the author i live in birmingham rosa parks made her heroic stand against racial injustice in montgomery simple facts like this seem to be trivial to the authors who are more concerned with expressing their overall disgust with a south that has seemingly not changed much since the days of slavery well i certainly wouldn t say everything is perfect here but as the authors admit nowhere is perfect the southeast is one of the fastest growing regions for economical development and changes are taking place birmingham does boast to be the birth place for civil rights and we have an excellent civil rights museum that i have taken the time to actually visit to learn of the past injustices with the hope that i will be part of a better place for all i resent being lectured to by the main author who evidently loves his teaching job and if he does want to lecture this southerner i would expect him to take time to at least learn some of the more major details of the civil rights movement very little sailing story lots of liberal opinions spewed forth as though they were facts when even his facts are wrong if you want to read about a sailing story buy sailing the dream i am going to return my copy of this book to the author i may even take a red pen and mark all of his errors i would give him a grade of f if i were his professor 
shipping cost when i ordered the books and checked out there was no indication of the shipping cost since i dealt thru amazon before i assumed the shipping to be included when i received my invoice the shipping cost equalled the cost of the books i contacted the seller and was told that was the way it was i am very unhappy that i have to pay this cost as the books were already shipped if you are going to use this type of outside services i would advise you to insure that the customer knows what he will pay in total before they complete their order this transaction is a negative for amazon regard 
not good for learning ok as a reference book i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant heavy top bschool this text was recommended for my intro cap markets class although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class i often used it to gain understanding of what was taught in class unfortunately i found this book to be extremely painful it was verbose overly complicated hard to read poorly organized full of jargon while it is thorough in its coverage of capital markets instruments i found it to be nearly impossible to read esoteric theories mathematical proofs were introduced with little background and often without insufficient detail to understand grasp but the jargon vocabulary are what made the book so unreadable trying to read a chapter in this book would literally consume hours of my time and forget about trying to use this book to do problemsets or assignments i could go on but trust me this book is bad unless you already have a good intro just want to use this as a reference 
not for a modern economist book is out of date with modern economic thought essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets 
it tastes very bland why did they not republish the first edition that tasted of strawberries and cheese this new version with it s claims of a quotlighter nuttier quot taste is plain awfu 
the thing about a confessional the thing about a confessional is that no one ever confesses times when they did something good times when they were more clever than usual or nicer when you confess you re exposing the times you were cruel or petty or stupid this book is a confessional theres not a single likable person in the book this is an understatement along the lines of goebbels would have made a bad rabbi but there you go i d put this book down and feel depressed about life the illustrations are good although it was strange that after spending six detailed pages learning about the main character s tattoos and the crappy quality of them we never actually see any tattoos in any of the pictures of the main character 
filler anecdotal worthwhile information when i first bought it for myself and skimmed the first few pages i was very excited about the book and thought that it would be a worthwhile read as i kept reading though it became increasingly apparent that this guy was just trying to sell copies of his book and didn t have much worthwhile information to say he constantly repeats that he is showing you how to get rich without providing any substantive advice he repeats lists that have little or no value including things like work hard over and over again from the outside in it seems great but after going through it you will have learned very little from the book all of the worthwhile information in the book could be sufficiently summarized in two paragraphs i find it hard to believe that most of the other reviewers actually read the entire book do yourself a favor and read the better books out there like clason s the richest man in babylon 
a little voice says dont waste your money the main thing i learnt from this book is that it is definitely better sometimes to look through a book before buying it i thought this was a very juvenile book in terms of the level of smearing and name calling i thought there was e g the false memory syndrome foundation is described as the cia s answer to the flat earth society and col john alexander is given the epithet doctor of death some child abuse cases are recounted with an unnecessary level of graphic detail and the author includes a partially obscured picture of a scene of child pornography i wondered if this was really needed but then i remembered that the publisher is feral house which also publishes books by satanist anton lavey and the apocalypse culture books which also feature child porn instead of blaming the cia for everything mr constantine could also have pointed the finger at his publisher for potentially encouraging satanism and child abuse i don t really want to spend more time saying what i didn t like about this book but i didn t like the way the author seemed to be so sure of himself some examples all ufos are manmade all alien abductions are cia abductions remote viewing is the cia beaming images into people s heads 
it would be a waste of fire to burn this book reads like it was written by an elementary schooler during recess and stereotypes every culture character it tries to relate to the reader insulting to the intelligence of its audience possibly the most laughable piece of garbage ever put into hard cover 
so bad i don t own it anymore what really turned my off on the book was the online examples of animation work the authors had done a lot of the most celebrated works were satanic in nature seriously or otherwise too prepusbescent homoerotic i feel as a serious artist the intentions spewing forth from their work was a mental block and i could not read another word still trying to blot the horrible imagery from my memory thank god i have seen other flash animation because if all i had to go on with what the authors have done i think i would need to see a therapist i wouldn t let these guys teach me to tie my shoes i wouldn t trust them for fear that they d be at least be thinking about molesting me mentally besides flash aint easy either it s laborious and it s interface does not lend itself to unique character drawing just regular blobs that are easily regocnized as flash generated keep your day job 
mistakes in the editorial reviews of this book i strongly recommend the two major reviews of this book on this site one by d roberts and the other by alyssa a lappen they point out the books faults and bias in many different areas however i would like to very briefly point out simple basic mistakes made in the two editorial reviews of this book one by amazon com and one by publishers weekly the amazon com review says that the israelis and the palestinians struggled over this land for hundreds of years the fact is that the jewish connection to the land of israel goes back over three thousand years as for what are today called the palestinian arabs they did not exist even as much as one hundred years ago the various arab clans and communities a good share of which entered the land from egypt when there began large scale jewish return to the land did not have a conscious national identity that palestinian arab identity came only in reaction to zionism and the presence of the jews in the land another amazingly false claim perhaps taken from segev s stretchers is that the palestinian arabs have shown a greater inclination toward peace than the jews the fact is that five times in the past seventy years the arabs have been offered a state in a part of the land and have refused it even when they were offered the great share of the land they refused to live in peace with a much smaller jewish state one more word about segev s cover up of british hostility towards the jews his omitting major events in history such as the white paper prohibiting jewish immigration at a time the jews of europe had nowhere to go this cover up by segev is fairly characteristic of his work as a whole an israeli patriot he certainly is not perhaps what is worse is that he is not a fair and objective reporter 
a book of little inherent value i have to disagree with every review written about this book thusfar it is not well written for one the style is amateurish and it has little substance but that s not what really bothers me about this book what really bothers me is that he writes about soliciting a prostitute that he describes as having a twelveyearolds body another thing that bothered me was that george packer dropped out of the peace corps without even telling his so called friends in the village that he was leaving he wasted the opportunity that was given to him wrote a mediocre book about it and yet reviewers come on amazon com and laud it want some free advice read any other book about africa togo or the peace corps instead this one is not very good 
title misleading there was hardly any mention of pixel the cat it was alot of dialog tried to resemble a fast paced action book but i found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while for a female i like action and for the plot to move along there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging and multiple partner sex i felt like the over tone to the book was well ok we all have alot of sex with lots of different people in the future it was too focused on that i liked stranger in a strange land alot better by the time i was through with this book i kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page 
i was disappointed i had not read ted dekker until i read his collaboration with frank peretti with the recent house i really liked that book so i was looking forward to reading more by dekker unfortunately this was the one i read next and i was very disappointed it was hokey i m hoping that some of his others are better 
very repetitive and let s face it she s not quite a master yet i am an elementary school art teacher and over the years i have observed more extraordinary child artists than alexandra nechita her paintings are extremely repetitive and in the process of this book her art doesn t develop at all 
whisper of the hatchet the most telling remark i can make about this book which i picked up for about off a publishers overstock pile in a bookstore is that i learned far more facts about mencken from the brief anonymous wikipedia org entry than from the leaden pages of character assassination found here and that i wish i had my back teachout whoever that is seems to appreciate mencken as a writer and despise him as a person there are two aspects to mencken s character that can be best understood by noticing two stereotypes he fits into teachout notices neither let me illucidate mencken fits into the familiar modern stereotype of nerd he lived with his mother for most of his life and did most of his work in the same bedroom he occupied as a small child he was a compulsive worker tended to avoid entanglements with women was overweight and out of shape need i go on he held at arm s length any female he knew who was interested in sex to judge by the contents of their surviving letters to him only married after his mother died and married an invalid whom doctors had correctly assured him could not live more than years after her death he immediately moved back to the old homestead living now with his unmarried brother and two servants inherited from his brief married days he was self educated and so never examined the received prejudices about alien and inferior races and cultures and the unworkability of democratic institutions he had absorbed as a small child the writer h p lovecraft whom teachout might never have heard of and who was also and not coincidentally an ur nerd invites very close comparison with mencken in many if not in all such aspects like lovecraft he wrote many public and private diatribes against the jews in the abstract yet had many close jewish friends and associates like lovecraft he tended not to view with alarm the rise of fascism in europe mencken is still of great interest as a social and political critic as a scholar of american english usage and as the master of a prose style so forceful and vivid that it practically leaps off the page and strikes you between the eyes like a vaudeville slapstick what mencken needs is for more of his books to be brought back into print and adequately publicized teachout to his credit has worked effectively to get more of mencken into print but still on a recent visit to two large bookstores one carrying new books and one used books i was able to locate precisely zero works by mencken on any topic let me give hlm himself the last word as democracy is perfected the office of the president represents more and more closely the inner soul of the people we move toward a lofty ideal on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart s desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron hlm in the baltimore sun july we had to wait more years but 
a cynical author who hates animals i decided to give this book a chance but wish i hadn t the author has a hateful attitude toward animals that is simply offensive that combined with his extreme cynicism really prevented me from enjoying the book not recommended 
the listless word finder this was an extremely frustrating book to read there were many gaps in the word lists the two letter word list only contained of the acceptable two letter words it was missing ag ex hm mm mo mu ne uh um wo and xu all of those words are contained in the official scrabble players dictionary but not contained in this book based on that dictionary the three letter words from two letter words also had many gaps the very first two letter word aa cindery lava only listed baa and totally missed aah aal and aas this is just one of many many omissions through out the book the only benefit i found in having the book was in finding some words which contain a particular letter in the middle of the end of the word but even these lists were incomplete this book is not worth the investment 
see the movie instead good eastwood streep movie but terrible book the plot itself is fine but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy skip the book and watch the movie if you want to read a well written love story that doesn t insult your intelligence then may i suggest jane austen s pride and prejudice now that s good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
can t i do no stars this book is just awful there are such biased misrepresentations of christians and the bible that it would be viewed as bigoted if it were aimed at any other group of people the bible is misquoted taken out of context and generally misapplied anyone who chooses to use this as a classroom adjunct should first be mandated to study what the scriptures really has to say 
worst book on fx that i have ever read i would agree with the prior review that states that author has not even tested whether what he advises works or not this appears in my opinion to an amateur trader writing a trading book in my opinion a total waste of money if minus stars were allowed this one be the right candidate truly believe it is garbage this of course is my opinion after comparing this books to all the other books on the subject that i have read 
not very professional i agree with the first review one star however the book could be useful for someone who is starting to make his way in learning in strategic games i would also mention that floppy comes with the book c code for dos platform so the fact that of the book is a source listing is annoying begginers would find first couple of chapters interesting though 
just very odd this story should have and could have been really good it presents a great concept but the story is just so poorly crafted it is very sexist the prose is stiff and the plot is dull i will concede that it was interesting at times it kept me reading but i really didn t get much out of it i can only praise heinlein for including the intelligent conversation which takes place after the press conference where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn the whole story is just very odd do read it though it s a title to read if you wish to be considered well read despite its faults valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten just as we will never forget atticus from to kill a mockingbird 
don t waste your time this book belongs to the george steiner school of writing extremely pretentious aggressively obscure frustratingly allusive barely grammatical how can cambridge home of russell and moore i a richards and wittgenstein tolerate let alone produce this kind of pseudo erudite claptrap here is how derrida would write if he wrote in english fortunately the virtues of clarity and solid plain spoken prose are more celebrated among english speakers than french so dunn is hardly likely to assume the mantle of public intellectual he so evidently craves move on you re not missing anything here 
don t be fooled don t be fooled this book has a title very similar to the ultimate book of kid concocitons book i saw on pbs i bought this book thinking it was the pbs book and was very upset i m sure i am not the only one making this mistake the projects in this book are out dated and seem to be the same old things that have been around for years buyer beware ! i would bet the publisher did this to trick people into buying there book 
slaughterhouse is shallow and not very useful if you know much about the eastern front do not get this book ! although its advertising makes it sound like it is a thorough in depth book on its topic it is a actually just a shallow grab bag of random facts a lot of its material is freely available in greater detail on the web some of it is available in much greater detail slaughterhouse s section on weapons for example is so poor you have to wonder why they bothered to include it your money would be much better spent on something like the oxford companion to world war ii the oxford companion has a different emphasis that slaughterhouse but it is comprehensive and includes all of the war if you don t know much about the eastern front this book may have some value but i still recommend the oxford companion instead plus the free material on the internet 
chomsky the cia s favourite dissident chomsky s pseudo dissidence is revealed by among many other lies found throughout his oeuvre his repeated insistence upon the cia s unwavering fidelity to successive presidents where the evidence is contrary he ignores it nowhere is the suppression more systematic than in rethinking camelot jfk the vietnam war and us political culture consider in particular his stalinoid survey of the vietnam coverage of the new york times from october to december in this paperback edition pp one omission among many will suffice on october the nyt carried a column entitled the intra administration war in vietnam it opened the central intelligence agency is getting a very bad press in despatches from vietnam its author arthur krock proceeded to quote extensively from one such despatch arrogant cia disobeys orders in vietnam by richard starnes of the scripps howard group the quotes below are from starnes s courageous and hauntingly prophetic original according to starnes s source twice the cia flatly refused to carry out instructions from ambassador henry cabot lodge even though one set had been brought direct from washington likening the cia s growth to a malignancy which he was not sure event the white house could control any longer the source predicted if the united states ever experiences a seven days in may it will come from the cia washington daily news october chomsky was and remains the creation and creature of the central intelligence agency rethinking camelot represented the cashing of the cia s most important dissident chip in its unending war against both genuine dissent and jfk s memory it is a measure of the fear corruption and cowardice prevalent in mainstream anglo american academia and media that chomsky s imposture has gone unchallenged for so long 
moaning and groaning at a respectful distance be warned this book is over pages long and every character is a talking cadaver yes there are seven narrators but as many critics have noted their voices meld into one this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel instead of being in the company of seven different characters i felt i was in the company of a single person the author and he wasn t feeling that great the book reads as a dreary confession one that would have any self respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad there is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine and in more ways than one a change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or more surprisingly regarding a character s motivations rather than being akin to rashomon where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story this lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension and in itself deprives the voices of individuality yes one character can see things which another can t but it s more a case of adding to the overall picture instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space the rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter this is not faulkner the vocabulary is similarly uniform as an example perfunctory and insensate are used by angela while for joe it s obfuscate these being the two allegedly less educated characters the characters all achieve a similar level of insight into and reflection upon themselves perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by simon the literary minded precipitant of events for all his alleged passion for poetry his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character the dialogue is poorly written in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts and the overall tone is awkward and dead perhaps the dennis mitchell chapter escapes this criticism the two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful we are carefully informed about the size of their breasts and the allure of their eyes in intellectual matters they respectfully defer to their male superiors be this the soulful stuff of art or the technicalities of card counting in blackjack yawn there s not much evident irony in perlman s choice of such representations when anna reveals that he played me like a musical instrument i had to check the cover to make i sure i wasn t reading judith krantz if parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters and his handling of them share many qualities then there s is the central issue of simon s obsession with anna the narcissism inherent in this is impressive but its exploration is limited it might be raising the standard too high but tolstoy s anna karenina shows how multi faceted such an exploration can be perhaps more than reading the book itself it s interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating the very flatness of the style does make it easy to read the attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences adult relationships and unpredictable events is as everyone says ambitious it could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers it allows fractions of honesty to become visible while a veil remains over much of course fractions can add up to a sizeable sum my overall reaction to the book was negative and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by richard powers both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest and pen characters with surface complexities but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing as is a winning sense of humour at best this is a novel i might admire but not one that i could love 
beware of book beware of this book i opened it up and read through it and packed it up to return the same day rather than offering practical activities to help teens learn to deal with their anger it seemed to be a group workbook perhaps it just was not what i was expecting whatever the case dollars worth of book it was not 
nap time this was the first and last iris johansen book i will read i thought oh i need something to do at work since its going to be slow today i work in a library so i broght it with me and it was so boring i actually fell asleep ! i will not be finishing this book it has no substance i do not recommend it to anyone it is a waste of time and money although if your looking to take a nap then go ahead and read it 
anti western new age nonsense zukav has a decidedly anti western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking this is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics rather than writing a laconic outline of physics zukav spends the majority of his time praising eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective the reader is referred to any college physics textbook or isaac asimov s history of physics or a good set of encylopedias 
condescending racist fantasy this book is a perfect example of a reigning culture in this case western caucasian dressing up it s post slavery era losses and expanding colonialism as benevolent towards the childlike races that only need simple things to be happy in their subordination to the superior white people and their culture it stunk of racism to me when i was a child in the s and stinks of racism now in a post civil rights era where we should all know better than excuse this smiling little culturally unconscience evil there is no excuse for this propaganda 
trees of pennsylvania this field guide to the trees found in pennsylvania is typical of a field guide that is written by an author not intimately familiar with the region the range maps are generalized and don t accurately represent the actual distrabution of individual species as would range maps derived from research in herbariums with large amounts of pennylvania material the notes that accompany the descriptions are general and again don t represent an understanding of the details of the state s topography microclimates and general forest woodlandtree distrabution not recommended 
the phaidon press book is better the quality of the art covered in this book is highly uneven and many of the theories are terribly dated by today s standards i get the impression that it was written more to promote the friends of the authors than to give an objective view of feminist art the phaidon press book from the themes and movements series art and feminism is much better to the point that i am almost embarrassed to compare the two books there is a school of feminist research that seems to equate technical accomplishment with patriarchy which conveniently allows mediocre art to seem quite important overall the art in this book lacks guts although some of it is good since it is no longer the only book of its type get it only if you want to round off your collection otherwise stick with the phaidon press book to which this one merely pales in comparrison 
leaves me cold this rates as one of the poorer mysteries i have read in years it was truly an ordeal to finish and i am left wondering why i bothered it has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters many of whom are stereotypical creations of little or no interest i was particularly amused when the detective was told to quotmake a few inquiries at the transsexual shoe shop giving the size and style of the shoe from the corpse quot in all of la i am sure there is just one known quottranssexual shoe shop quot please i suspect ms laplante has better material but this is a poor example better left unread i would give it less than one star but unfortunately that s not an option 
this book is worthless i will be succint this book is absolutley worthless do not buy it unless you want to feel as ripped off as i do 
this is ridiculous i don t like fat people whether they are men or women americans each too many calories and do not get enough exercise there is no adonis complex i can t believe a guy actually spent his time looking through playgirl centerfolds to write a book buy a book on cycling or other exercise book it ll be money time and health better spent get outside and do something 
i felt that this book did not provide enough resources this book did not offer enough resouces for parents it was also pessimistic in terms of the outcome for dyslexics it was very helpful in terms of identifying characteristics that are not often associated with dyslexia yet it still appeared to be very general in catergorizing these characteristics one of the methods for teaching reading skills however was very helpful but other methods should have been given as well 
not catherine s best book i love catherine coulter books but this one was disappointing at best the formula for the book which involves female slavery has been used over and over in historical romances but this plot fails where many others succeed mainly because magnus is such a jerk throughout the whole story he never stops being cruel long enough to make this a good romance novel if you want a good coulter book read her bride triology but skip this book 
utter disappointment being a fan of such authors as j rr tolkien h g wells and c s lewis i figured i d try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the american west a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining i did some research and cormac mccarthy seemed to be the author to start with he got very good reviews from this site and professional critics i find it amazing that he received such great reviews this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit the book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly unexpectedly return to it i have never read a book like that before after completing this book i had found out more about the life of a prostitute than i ever wanted to know and also i received a free lesson in swearing i understand that it was custom in the west to swear and dealings with prostitutes was common but i think mccarthy went over the top this made it uninteresting and redundant then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods question marks and exclamation marks i did not see a single quotation mark and the word and was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run on sentences were monotonous after reading this book i also felt ignorant being uneducated in the spanish language much of the dialogue i could not understand in the least bit there were entire conversations written exclusively in spanish at times when it seemed relevant i felt like i missed a lot of important information in the story i did find that at time mccarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me i don t suppose i ll ever read a book by cormac mccarthy again 
eyeless in gaza hey ! i gave elizbeth royte s book stars not the secret wonders she works in this book ! elizabeth royte is a transformative writer an unassuming genius who wings hers way over the jellied mundane putrefyingly prosaic definitively overlooked commonly rejected stuff on earth your dear garbage she takes us on a grand reverse journey to rejected digesters and backs up to smelly sodden transfer stations and we are magically rewound swathed in strange new currents i was surprised by my own puddled reflection puzzling in an oily rainbow shimmer when she asked what can we recover what can be reclaimed who will redeem the land i wanted to answer her powerful questions 
disapointing if you are going to get a book to help you restore your ducati twin you better pass on this one and get a good shop manual there is litle material of use and the content is mostly a repeat of is other ducati books you would expect a step by step knowhow aproach with usefull imputs like the dave richardson guzzilogy book for moto guzzi a good restoration book is about guiding the reader with how to hints tips and tricks from pros that have done it many times there are lots of photos that will show you a ducati part with a typo description an no more like for example this is what a ducati clutch looks like photo 
ewwww let me start off by saying that i m not a fan of contemporary art that being said this book is incredibly difficult to read for me each sentence took several re reads before i could get some type of clue as to what he was trying to say i consider myself a good reader and this book was way out there with the uppity language my husband would get a kick out of me reading sentences to him just because they were impossible to understand if you like this sort of thing then you might like the book i however did not like the book i also did not like how they would describe a work of art in great detail yet show you a totally different piece from that artist it made if difficult to visually see what they were talking about my professor did a much better job explaining the material covered in this book 
the battle of gettysburg tension excitement boring when i think of the civil war i think of excitement and danger i expect to read a good rich book about it yet this book squeezes all the fun out of thesubject war yes war is nothing fun yet it may be exciting and detailed this book totally lacks all this information yet it does tell of the blood thirsty belligerent generals that are awaiting battle i have a love of books all throughout my life i have read many too i highly don t recommend this book for pleasure reading unless you want to get details for an essay forget about it 
daft this book is really really daft because to date there is only a minute number of mobile phones available on the planet which implement midp you can t imagine how painful that is because chances are you won t be able to run knudsen s code on your device not only that you won t even be able to compile it with your version tools it s a shame really it s otherwise a good intro to jme with plenty of code and an appendix which serves as a reference pity that we ll all have to wait at least for another year to use this book while the mobile device manufacturers get up to speed i for one am a bitterly disappointed programmer i can tell you that and wish i hadn t spend my last bucks on this book 
what the i grew up with this story what happened somewhere in this grossly underproduced version they forgot that even in a kids story you need talented actors kids know when someone sounds wooden and unskilled and you can t pawn something as poorly done as this off on them they re smarter than that ! i could ve done a better job in my garage under the bridge lived a troll come on 
childish this is the third in an expanding series set in a cod celtic world focussed on the quotkingdomquot of deverry i was impressed enough by the first to buy the whole opening quartet and was sadly disappointed books and are advertised as re written and are reasonably polished the unrevised rd and th books have a first draft quality and increasing reliance on dialogue long stretches that read like film script which isn t well written and expose the poor quality of the character writing book dealt with some adult themes principally incest but in book the heroine jill is just gratuitously and tastelessly sexually abused the main gimmick of the series is that the main characters are linked by destiny through reincarnation and it records their quotreunionsquot at different points in history in the first book the stories run parallel and reflect on each other as the series runs on the link between eras is weaker and the switch between stories is awkward and arbitrary in the later volumes in an attempt to open the story into an eternal battle between good and evil the author crow bars in opposing schools of quotlightquot and quotdarkquot magic obviously quotinspiredquot by the force from star wars her magicians also travel and fight on an quotastral plane quot extraordinarily similar to the world of marvel comics hero dr strange in the final analysis these are teen romances with very few original ideas populated by lacklustre characters adequately written but operating on the law of diminishing returns i bought them so i had to read them don t be sucked in 
woeful i have been reading cornwell for about a decade now and in the s i thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there her first or novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book trace represents an all time low the thing that got me was the level of the writing it just seemed so flat and lifeless i found it repetitive in the first chapter when scarpetta is saying to herself that she should have been told it just seemed so ordinary almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like cornwell 
missing the book the problem with this book is that the author completely overlooks the culpability of the u s in the acts of genocide discussed the u sbombing of cambodia although not in itself an act of genocide was the reason why peasants flocked to the khmer rouge who previously were a marginal group it was the u s who blocked any attempts of the un to send more soldiers to rawanda as well it was the u s that armed indonesia so that they could attack and occupy east timor a clear case of genocide etc etc etc 
anti family secularist claptrap i just wonder if this would have been published without the author s being married to an author i find his stuff repetitively boring as well this is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can t stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic depressive sorry term has been replace by bi polar victim whose wealth seems to make her the star their enemy is the evil cant use that word either eagle forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia it seems that bothladies have problems oops not allowed any more by the political correctness police i mean issues with their male counterparts they act like they hate their husbands id recommend this to anyone who hates religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs a dog 
turned me off to doulas this book turned me off to the whole idea of a doula for financial reasons i was unable to hire a doula but had heard they could be a big help and this book came highly recommended i was hoping for a section on breathing or relaxation techniques i came away with the feeling the authors felt no birth experience could be a success or enjoyable unless a doula was present there was a very clear message that the father could not be a sufficient coach and his role was periphery to the doula i was disappointed in the lack of encouragement the authors gave the father to be an active participant in the whole birth process or that the mother would lose control of herself if a doula was not present it was almost a throw back to when my father had to fight to be at my birth and that was years ago 
worm ridden wormwood g p taylor struck out with his much hyped debut the tepid religious fantasy shadowmancer and the follow up wormwood is even less engaging than shadowmancer was while it s fairly well written it s loosely strung together with dull characters and a plodding plot in the mid s london is gripped by panic somehow the earth is overspinning and then it stops so that london is plunged into permanent night a young servant girl agetta is terrified of what is going to happen especially because her master kabbalah master and scientist dr sabian blake is predicting that a comet called wormwood will strike the earth this information comes from the mysterious book nemorensis that blake was given by a stranger the nemorensis supposedly contains all the secrets of the universe unfortunately the book also exerts a sinister influence over agetta but in an attic is tegatus an angelic being who might just be the savior london needs religious fantasy or fantasy with religious undertones is not a bad thing j rr tolkien c s lewis and others allowed their religions to influence their life s work but g p taylor not only has the subtlety of a battering ram he s also quite boring the story plods along in a string of little plot related scenes without building up much momentum one of the biggest problems is the way taylor handles the fantastical elements of his book okay there are weird creatures most fantasy books have those but his seem to just be thrown into the mix for no apparent reason his handling of superstition and science in the s is sketchy at best no matter how brilliant a scientist blake is meant to be taylor has a decent enough writing style and he has a certain flair for description and atmosphere but his style is also very repetitive and over thetop where are the editors when you need them what s worse his idea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot the actual fantasy plot is just more of taylor s lukewarm generic christian sentiments and some truly bizarre theology can angels drown the characters are as thin as the pages there are a lot of characters for a relatively slim fantasy book and many of them are left underdeveloped blake and agetta are the only ones who receive any character development and that isn t saying much agetta in particular seems almost manic considering how fast her moods swing tegatus the depressed angel is just freakin boring gp taylor strikes out again with wormwood another dull religious fantasy that leaves a sour taste in the mouth boring messy and not worth the effort it takes to wade through 
is james patterson lending his name to somebody else i can t think about any other explanation for this silly stupid thriller if you want to call it that i can t believe that the writer is doing so badly i am most certainly disappointed with this book in the last couple of years i think he had lost his steam plus why does he have to come up with books or so a year why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher it s time for me to move on to another writer i would advice readers to not to read this book 
poor writing short on detail i bought both this book and al linders walleye book save your money and do not buy this book al s books are extremely detailed and full of uselful techniques covering all situations for walleye fishing great on the biology and life cycle of these fish this book was not worth the money 
boring i could not get into this book the storyline was dull and so were the characters not recommended 
less than i had hoped for i picked up sheldon cashdan s the witch must die the hidden meaning of fairy tales because i had an idea for a fairy tale inspired short story and wanted to do a little bit of research i gleaned a few insights from the pages of the book but mostly found it did not live up to all my expectations the book is classified as pscyhology and cashdan makes the case for fairy tales offering psychologists and patients insights into psychological problems this was something i had a hard time swallowing but then maybe this has something to do with my lack of conviction in pscyhology there are a lot of fairy tales out there and there s no way cashdan could possibly be expected to offer a full analyzation of each one but he does base his conclusions on a very small sampling of fairy tales to the point that some of what was said seemed a bit repetitive there was also far too much time discussing the movie versions particularly the disney versions of many of the stories while a comparison of disney movies to their original tales would make an excellent subject for a book in the witch must die it only serves to confuse the issue so i will continue with my fairy tale research i have a volume containing the complete brothers grimm fairy tales which i intend to get to one of these days and a couple of weeks ago picked up a copy of uses of enchantment the meaning and importance of fairy tales by bruno bettelheim which cashdan had referenced a few times at a used book sale 
fables are easy to write about borrow the book from the library wasting your money on fables is not wise unless you like wasting money while entertaining this is not worthy of a library collection item 
please read why i give this book one star it deserves less i have the institutes and i have read with careful atention calvin s doctrine of salvation he teaches pretty well some christian truths he uses the bible and the church fathers but when calvin gives his or luther s peculiar teachings he shows how unchristian his doctrine really is by not quoting a single nt text or church father to support what is nothing more than an heretic view just to give an example he teaches in this book that the good works of the christian stink smell horrible but calvin doesn t give a single quote from the nt or the fathers to support this view his teaching is clearly anti biblical one more when he teaches about righteousness he never quotes matthew in this text jesus tells us that if our justice is not superior than the scribes we won t enter the kingdom of heaven justice for matthew is good work of love for god and the needy mt calvin simply doesn t quote this biblical text and just read his commentary on his harmony of the gospels and you will see how in some lines calvin just run from the simple sense of this text and that s because mt goes against his doctrine salvation by faith alone calvin taught that salvation can t be lost even tough this doctrine wasn t taught by the church fathers not even by augustine read daniel corner s conditional security of the believer yes you will find in this book his classic insult to god that he has predestined some people to hell and calvin s use of violence to support his views is well known let s reread the bible without calvin s lens 
one star for being short but one star is all it gets it lacks sufficient depth for such an interesting topic and drags needlessly over obvious arguments those attracted to teaching superficial philosophy might enjoy it but if you ve thought about the subject already save your time and money you ve read it all before 
do you believe in etheric formative forces this is total bs absolutely nothing grounded in reality these people or completely mad unless you believe in magic and hocus pocus stay away scary ! 
more than a disappointment i wanted to cry when i put this book down because i miss the danielle steele that wrote thurston house family circle and others for years now i have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers i really feel like her heart just isn t in it anymore she has become very idiosyncratic and predictable every book has her main character being honest i keep reading because i am a loyal danielle steele fan and i write this in hopes she ll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it like she once did or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works this book was just awful 
cynosure scallions on the mountain look downwards upon the zebus sevens really tried to like this book premise was grand story bobbed and weaved conclusion was flimsy discursive scientific literalizations distract disorient crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak they don t come across to the reader as likeable 
disappointing positives about this book is that unlike other books which offer cure nowhere does null states or implies that the book is intended to cure or eliminate any sort of disease or illness besides that aspect the book is largely disappointing unfortunately much of the information contained here can be found on the internet but there are several problems as well in certain illness or diseases he can state up to possible herbs vitamins which can be confusing at times the problem is that for some of them he is reluctant to tell you the appropriate dosages to take secondly there side effects for example take b over the long run can cause nerve damage which brings up the next point which he is reluctant to tell the precautionary details of combining certain herbs and supplements which can be toxic and deadly you can t just tells the reader take this take that and not tell them what might happen for example he recommends echinacea for cancer and cts and other health problems but in certain cases echinacea has been known to cause liver inflammation kidney failure or irregular heart rate that just one example of many herbs that can be toxic this is book that pretty much i or you can make just by going to the library and the internet searching for diseases and illness but somebody who is scholar and has phd should not take the short cut to make easy and just throw information without and facts research in the end you can t distinguish this book from what you read on the internet so than you have to ask you re self this question why bother buying it ps this absolutely not the whole encoylopedia of natural healing he leaves out a few hundred other major disease ilness 
couldn t stand it this is the first book i have tried to read by kingsolver and i couldn t finish it the first pages as far as i could get read like a romance novel with all the smelling of pheromones and aching pubic bones i just couldn t stand it this is a character driven novel and i did not like any of the characters for a story about a woman s sense of place and insects for that matter i liked margaret drabble s the peppered moth a whole lot better 
not a mention of islamic arabic art wow sombody s biased the global art book barely mentions an iraqi and iranian piece of art however it chooses to limit the children s scope from islamic art i view this as another biased piece of work that is keen on dividing the world rather than a simple tool for educating children about the world or so called quotglobal art quot 
a banal and brainlessly belligerent buffoon i read parts of this book until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and i immediately returned it to the library what a stultifying simpleton this man is he is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas and unsurprisngly this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the david letterman show and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity first he claimed that no one should criticize president bush because we re at war and it s no good for the country come again i say that such a statement is no good for democracy which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about the right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the first amendment and this man is a graduate of the john f kennedy school of government also he insisted that cindy sheehan whose son was killed in iraq not have the right to be publicly upset with president bush and the invasion of iraq because shes connected with left wing elements in this country what left wing elements i feel that cindy sheehan is as connected to left wing elements as much as bill o reilly is associated with logical reasoning 
good start weak middle and ending i gave it stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
will this ever end i admit that i m addicted despite the s low progress constant female bickering and frequent fashion details i want to see how this dang series ends will it this particular installment of the dragon et al left me feeling underwhelmed the ending was a disappointment but i ll press on and order book 
a big blowhard this guy may be a good gin player but he s really full of himself his advice is excessively basic also he admits that he cheats at cards for money finally reading this book will not make you a good gin player 
hard to extract the meat of the topic from this book it is no doubt that this author loves animals that is apparent what also is apparent is that the author is not a writer many chapters started out with a subject of discussion only to find by the end of the chapter the author touched on everything but the subject leaving the reading saying huh she vicariously relives too much of her own experience losing her self in it to the point that she forgets what it was that she wanted the reader to gain thus losing the the essence of the point there is a comparison to famed horse whisperer monty roberts to whom i have personally worked she is not a monty roberts i beleive she is a caring individual with a lot of stories just not a writer i do not recommend this book as a guide to training or understanding dogs 
the essence of awful thomas frank has been endowed with a talent for writing tortured prose which is uniquely inelegant the washington post should really recruit him he could be much more effective at crippling the language there instead he makes do with whatever scraps of intellect he possess to write articles in obscure magazines one stumbles over occasionally in second hand bookstores and this wretchedness thomas frank is no more equipped to comment on the sixties then michael crichton would be on bertrand russel 
nanny diaries devil wears prada really there s no difference in these two books they both have whiny main female heroines who invoke zero sympathy ! this book was not funny not clever and definitely not worth spending money on i just don t understand how someone will stand for being stomped all over like this and does not quit especially after all the extra drama that popped up all she did was complain about everything just like andy in dwp i don t know which book was published first but the authors of this one and the dwp author had the same mind these books read almost exactly the same young girl gets impossible boss made to do unbelievable things the only person i felt bad for was grayer the son poor thing parents uninterested in spending time with him even though he loved them deeply i just don t see how a book can be humorous when this was ones of the book s main points i was going to use this book to see whether or not the movie would be worth viewing but i doubt i ll go see it if i do i ll be using a movie pass or someone else will foot the bill pass on this one 
imagine honduran women makes clothes in a sweatshop ing clothes think of the butlerian strategy of it all are they undoing gender wow ! and on pennies a day too think of the androgynous gay boy who might wear the same clothes as his bestest girlfriend think of the subversiveness of it all consider the fact that maybe the slave woman in honduras made those clothes how butlerian indeed ! 
nothing inspiring nor new here dertouzos churns out the usual information wil change the future vision that dominates books of this nature unfortunately nothing here is really new nor does dertouzos write with much passion nor pizazz his pronouncements come across as somewhat pretentious and trite i prefer esther dyson s release which hawks much the same vision but in a nicely homey conversational style that reveals how personal her book is compared to this one 
something is missing i can tell you that the main plot is thrilling the problem is where you can find it the book goes out of the main story so many times that you almost forget what you re reading the book s end lacks in wits hc just got out of ideas and finished the book like a fairy tale everybody found what they wanted and lived happily ever after that s not the way to finish this book because this book has a potential to a paramount end no matter if it s merry or not query which were the good guys 
bought this based on a star review why my child is in rd grade and must look up synonyms very few of the words on her lists are in this book this is not a helpful book at all i guess i should buy an adult thesaurus for rd grade 
excellent writer poor plot west is without a doubt a superb writer however i found the shoes of the fisherman to be a great dissapointment in spite of the fact that most of the reviews i have read higly praise the book it never really got to me the concept seems quite interesting at first an unknown russian cardinal kiril lakota is elected pope after being held prisioner for quite a few years he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity at the same time kamanev the man who had been lakota s prision guard in russia and who tortured him beyond belief has become the head of the russian government the fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot which in my opinion is never fully developed the main issue i have with the novel is that it is plotless nothing really happens a large portion of the book consists of a series of endless and a bit boring thoughts from lakota on the other hand the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader there are also a series of sub plots dealing with what lakota has to face as a pope regading human cruelty poverty and most of all politics which could have proven to be enough for a good novel unfortunatelly the narration goes astray in many parts which lessens one s interest in the book quite frankly i had to make a great effort to finish the book hoping that at some time it would pick up which it never did as i mentioned before west is a very good writer but this book is in my opinion highly overrated i can honestly say it never got my full atention 
not one to start with aaron sisson works in the english mining industry and is also a talented flortist disenchanted with his life he leaves his wife and children and finds work with an orchestra in london there and in italy he tries to come to terms with his life and emotions whilst finding new acquaintances in london society and then with britons in italy the novel centres on aaron s alienation his retreat from and aversion to responsibility for others it is right to stay in a relationship when you are feeling untrue to yourself by doing so just what are individuals responsibilities to each other these are familiar lawrence themes and will come as no surprise to those who have read his other works it s also very much a novel of its time pseudo fascist ideas are in the air social darwinism and nietzschean thought permeate the attitudes of the main characters especially lilly that being said this is somewhat second rate lawrence it s a very bitty novel it was written in haste sections completed then left for a considerable amount of time and it reads like that few of the characters are convincingly drawn others appear then disappear without reason and without contributing to the novel in any meaningful way the strength of the prose is variable with large sections of the novel stagnating as a result one for those interested in reading lawrence s lesser known works but i should imagine a turn off for those trying him out for the first time g rodger 
the same old lies repackaged this one s easy the lies start showing up even in the book description the zionists established a sovereign jewish state in had they been content with that peace might have followed the war when israel could have backed the creation of a palestinian state in the occupied territories actually the zionists were willing to accept the tiny country that was initially israel but the surrounding arab nations attackeed immediately after the war israel offered virtually all the so called west bank but without east jerusalem back to jordan they offered gaza back to egypt they did not offer the golan heights back to syria because they no longer wanted to be sitting ducks for syria s artillery israel s offer of the west bank and gaza back to jordan and egypt was offered at a price recognition peace and negotiation at the arab summit in kartoum the arabs responded to israel s offer with no no and no israel had every right at this point to annex the territories won in a defensive war but under pressure from the u s and elsewhere israel did not after the war in there was no talk of a palestinian state in the territories for years jordan occupied the west bank and there was no arab or palestinian clamor for a palestinian state for years egypt occupied gaza and there was similar silence there was no reason for israel to talk about yet another arab state when even the arabs hadn t talked about it the whole idea of a palestinian state was a concept invented by the surrounding arab nations to make war against israel by a new method public relations if they could make the world believe that israel was an occupier of lands not theirs they hoped world opinion could defeat israel where arab armies could not nevertheless in the arab nations tried yet again but were trounced and the war by public relations started to ramp up in my opinion neuman s solution the only solution is for israel to withdraw unilaterally to its borders shows real impoverishment of thought for almost years the middle east s arab and muslim nations have been trying unsuccessfully to destroy a nation that was recognized by the united nations and which was purchased totally and legitimately from recognized landowners but it is israel which must surrender at the time of israel s creation arabs who were residents and who had not decided to flee at the request of the attacking arab nations were to be given full political rights unlike for example jordan transjordan at the time in which jews were not allowed to live in fact although there is racism on the part of individuals in israel israel itself is not a racist state it is the surrounding muslim and arab nations who are the racists in my opinion neumann s book even if you consider only its book description is trash in the spirit of the anti semitc czarist forgery protocols of the elders of zion 
avoid avoid avoid this book is silly you could get better results by buying a bag of fortune cookies saving the fortunes from the cookies taping them to a dartboard and throwing a dart with that approach you could have had cookies too 
was she really that good of a mother i don t feel that miller made much of an attempt to prove that anna was in fact a good mother like another reviewer said i don t think she was a bad mother but the book really didn t go into much detail about anna s relationship with molly especially up until anna ex husband filed for custody and instead focused on anna s life experiences and psyche after brian said he wouldn t send molly back anna didn t even seem that concerned about molly s mental and emotional well being she just focused on her notion that leo s actions were simply taken out of context and while she wanted to see molly again i got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her rights as a mother not out of a concern for her daughter and what was so great about leo anyway he wasn t exactly nice to anna often condescending to her and from the beginning i felt that his affection for molly was a farse simply to stay on anna s good side he also seemed sexually possessive of anna like the scene when he kept having sex with her after molly came into the bed because of a nightmare i think anna loved her daughter but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love since she had never felt such an attraction before as a result her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for months with dire consequences although she did show some signs of remorse she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter s welfare if she had put her daughter first from the beginning instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new family she and leo were forming then she probably never would have lost custody of her child 
over rated unussually boring some books in my opinion are just plain overrated the characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting likewise the tale the reader takes nothing from it put this in a list with franzen s the corrections and frazier s cold mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
a waste of time by a thoroughly discredited author if you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets you d have a great case against these two ! this book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new in fact it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the quotexperimentquot providing only bits and pieces along the way it actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case a don t know much about william l moore but i used to read all charles berlitz s books when i was a kid as i thought the bermuda triangle made for some great stories but as i got older i realized that that s all they were charles berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while quotresearchingquot his bermuda triangle books just rehashed old sailor s tales i recall him during a guest spot on the quotlarry king live quot program and when i coast guard officer called in and provided known verifiable details on some of his quotwithout a trace quot cases berlitz looked like a monkey as a former coast guard rescue pilot myself stationed for years in borinquen puerto rico one of the apexes of the quottrianglequot i can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to quotdisappear without a trace quot and that there is nothing mysterious about it its a big ocean ! i witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena all of which had perfectly good explanations save yourself some money and avoid all books that have charles berlitz s name associated with them unless you re reading them for quotentertainment purposes only quot 
double tap this was the first audio book i ever listened to perhaps that is why i found it rather boring and unexciting maybe i would have enjoyed it more if i had read it myself instead of listening to joe mantegna reading it i hate to criticize mr mantegna because i really liked him when i used to watch the show joan of arcadia but there were many places where i would have accented certain words differently and i found myself getting upset at the way he read it in some parts i love lawyer books but have certainly read better at any rate this audio book was not worth the money i paid for it even though i bought it on sale maybe i am just not a candidate for audio books i thought it would amuse me while driving to and from work and to my house at the shore and it did up to a point i am now looking for audio books that are cheaper because they just go too quickly for me i am now trying to find someone to give it to and i am also trying to find more audio books to try that are not so expensive i guess i should re join the library if i want to continue listening to audio books 
an easy read to kill the time but not much more reading dark harbor is like watching a mediocre tv show that you can t be bothered to turn off i listened to dark harbor as an audio book so i don t feel too badly about wasting my time on it because i read it while i was doing other things that had to be done anyway like driving if you are looking for something that feels fresh and new dark harbor is not for you this novel is about as innovative as an episode of murder she wrote to illustrate stone barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim s wrong hand i think i actually saw that one on murder she wrote woods either can t be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn t care it is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in dark harbor this isn t because the clues come together in any logical way but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel you can just tell this doesn t mean that the solution makes sense in fact there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced it is as if woods couldn t be bothered to think all of his plot lines through woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do except of course to have sex with stone holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island on her second trip she has an obligatory romp with stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel why was she kidnapped i don t think anyone including woods can answer that question in any plausible way my theory is that woods needed to work holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages it also allowed him to include holly s dad another regular character in her search wood s motive seems obvious the kidnapper s motive however isn t her kidnapping makes no sense but clearly this was something woods didn t think was worth worrying about the best i can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read of course in my case it was read to me it may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read and certainly not to buy but as an audio book from the library with a limited selection of audio books to choose from it helped me pass the time in traffic 
did you all actually read it first off i am an avid reader and love a long challenging read however this novel is one of the worst i have ever read ! it is long boring and has absolutely no plot i purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews although from the looks of most of them here i personally suspect that many of those who raved never actually read the book 
accurate but boring other than the chapter on the driods this book is not worth your time better to read kip thorne how the author could have taken such interesting subjects and made them some uninteresting is somewhat amazing don t read this 
doesn t live up to the hype as a stand alone story not a prequel this book is relatively fun if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos i can t believe this made it past editing as far as being a prequel to barrie s peter pan this book misses the mark there are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower retelling of barrie s richly woven classic these are not the characters we knew and loved this is not the never land we dreamed about at night pixie dust is now nothing more than space dust which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact need i say more 
not enough this is the required text for my course i ve read it thoroughly and it seems great but it definitely is not getting me the grade i want i m buying a different textbook to supplement 
what a disappointment i have been reading the anita books and loved it ever since guilty pleasures that is why i m thoroughly disappointed with this book i m halfway through the book already and still there s not even a hint of a big bad after the scene at the club it s like pages of repetative sex scene nonsense i found myself glossing through paragraphs just to get to the end of the chapter it feels like lkh ran out of things to write and stretched a scene into chapters i mean the curing gregory part was just wayyyyyy tooooooo loooonnngggg if the remaining books are like this i think i m going to pass it and anita is getting to be so annoying whatever happened to her raising the dead or her police work or hell does she even works at her office anymore 
pop psychology at its worse mr jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops seminars presentations publications certifications if you ve got the money then they have something to sell you and all of it is centered around what is termed brainbased learning but what this book presents is little more than pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations for example it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and hence classrooms should be painted yellow however he doesn t offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up its all just ridiculous how does this stuff ever make it into print 
my first koontz reading for the first or chapters of sole survivor i was intrigued and interested i found myself as i usually do trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what i was feeling when the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at technologik i found myself thinking i didn t think of that one the main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters the story just ended when i felt the was more that needed to be explained there were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended it left me wanting to know more 
lots of spirit though not much of the metaphysical variety although this book didn t really live up to expectations i will at least say it provided an entertaining read if you re already familiar with contemporary sci fi you won t find too many new ideas here a lot of the ground in this book has already been covered in works like the diamond age neal stephenson nanotech opus neuromancer william gibson disembodied id shifting enders game orson scott card automated education or the transmigration of timothy archer phillip k dick tricked out humans of course the main difference here is that mr kurzweil is not a sci fi author but a proven inventor and entrepeneur he acknowledges the speculative non fiction aspects of the book but at times gets carried away with his predictions and occasionally sounds like a hokey traveling salesman throughout the book he claims some degree of expertise in such broad ranging interests as nanotechnology neurology interactive entertainment visual arts biology anthropology philosophy ethics and sexuality granted the material draws on many of these disciplines but his arguments often come to conclusions that simply have no scientific basis this book published in suggested that our brains will be scanned in the near future the concept sounds very ghost intheshell and has about as much plausibility as a typical japanese animation an article appearing in the october issue of discover asked the question will anyone ever decode the human brain the author much less optimistic than kurweil noted that no conceivable technology will be subtle enough to discern all the memories emotions and meanings aroused in us by our perceptions he made this assumption based on the fleeting nature of the actual neurons in your brain that change and evolve rapidly every day to equate this mush with bits and bytes jpegs and mp s is a little naive and ridiculously optimistic hopefully it will happen someday maybe even in our lifetime until then though you d be better off reading real fiction this book s almost saving grace is kurzweil himself he s obviously having fun writing this book and presumably hopes to raise some eyebrows even when that comes off as legacy building remember you read that here first it s oddly charming inserting himself into a dialogue with his fictitious creation molly is at first obnoxious condescending even but by the end it s actually pretty amusing that said if you re holding out for some deep insight as to what a spiritual machine might be i ll save you the trouble by telling you that the author s angle in the two pages it s mentioned is that spirituality basically boils down to biological phenomena sorry that it apparently that was good enough for mr data so it s also good enough mr kurzweil computers will one day magically start loving once they re smart enough of course in the mean time we can gloss over the fact that subjective ai is still a non entity in our world 
poor service very poor follow up as part of a order i ordered the michelin france provence map in english and the michelin red guide france hotels and restaurants in english both items they sent me were written in french which are of no value to me i requested a shipping label to return the map and the book and asked they send me the english versions the amazon outsourcing desk in india refused both request i requested an american amazon customer service manager contact me on this issue that has never happened i am also being asked my satisfaction on a d book markets of provence which they never sent me the remainder of my order were the english versions as ordered my overall satisfaction well below the star shown actual satisfaction f minus for all departments in amazon and far less for their very poor customer service and lack of ethical follow up for their mistake 
not very simple great book for domains with child domains but for simple starters it is not what i thought it would be limited detail in the migration and even more limited in basic tasks the book is good just not for starters i recommend something else 
couldn t have gotten any worse i couldn t put this book down not because it was so good mind you but because i wanted to see just how bad it was going to get this was one truly awful book the premise of the book sounded intriguing and i was really looking forward to enjoying this book as much as i did the first in this series but man this was bad first of the book doesn t even take place at camp crystal lake but some college campus the idea is simple jason goes to the lowest level of hell a nice nod to dante and is convinced to kill his way up the levels of hell to make his way back to the surface world and kill some more only his return is more like the s flick shocker and much less like a friday the th movie the author goes out of his to make jason a lifeless moron who whimpers like a baby when he s injured i could go on but please skip this book read the previous book in the series and pretend this installment never happened god knows i m trying to erase it from my mind as i write this 
why continue to be deceived tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the pre trib circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler etc continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen s the real rapture based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period series see prophecy house s web site prophecyhouse dot com for details on these items 
as authentic as a daytime soap opera i d heard the buzz both pro and con and thought i d take an independent read i was dismayed with this book james frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had one of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the truth so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him lies are what enable slips and enabling and denial and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure recovery is nearly impossible without honesty so can we look at this man s memoir and expect it to offer anything of value it s poorly constructed repetitive and narcisitic even if oprah hadn t exposed him the writing takes the tone of whoppers like frey s account of the drug house visit in which he rescues lilly other reviewers and smoking gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one and i can t improve on that suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life the same way a million little pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction a real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result i was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept like a joke of some kind i m not laughing 
don t waste your money on this i did not find this book helpful at all i guess i should have known better but i thought maybe it would have one piece of useful information it didn t 
sad reality of the cultural revolution fast easy page turner i read it in one day that gives interesting insight into what it may have been like growing up during the cultural revolution although it is insightful and terribly sad at times it was way too underdeveloped and never reached its full potential i wish the writer had gone much more in depth with the charachters and their anguish love fear livespassions and ambitions this was the first book i have read by this author and am curious about her other novels only because of her positive reviews however this book wasn t a mustread at all i would recommend it only if you have an interest in maoist china and the cultural revolution or a few spare hours to read an entire book 
misleading title too academic for rock and roll unfortunately many so called rock journalists are nothing more than sociology majors who let their devotion to an artists or group cloud their vision of unbiased criticism in this case we get a bit of that from the contributing writers as well as a bias toward progressive rock which is in most cases nothing more than classical music composer wannabees who don t want to miss out on the fabled rock lifestyle perhaps understanding irrevalent prog rock would have been a better title and why would anyone analyze a four minute song in pages does any true rock song need more than a couple of paragraphs this ain t mahler y know 
weak greene i have read graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie and it shows the book is not much more that a silly corny thriller just what hollywood orders over and over and over there is very little character development involved the the sense of place vienna after world war ii could have been given much greater depth as well this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen a half baked lame plot at that to make some cash pass this one by 
fear the offense i really hoped this book would live up to its promising title unfortunately it turned out to be not only all over the place in terms of its approach to the subject matter but alternately banal and inexplicably eccentric in adducing historical example the author jumps heedlessly back and forth between the strategic and tactical levels of war as he considers the history of warfare in the west along with mass armies railroads sea power and other of the usual topics regrettably his organization of the material never acknowledges the role of the operational level of war in bridging strategy and tactical battle through campaigns this oversight produces insights that are to the military mind humorously banal such as the following offensive operations then get launched even where states had defensive intentions pone is tempted to respond duh shraggy quester attributes this phenomenon not to the considerations of geography tactics weapons capabilities politics and alliances that normally go into such operational choices but to what he calls the offensive character of technology reducing the conscious human choices of offense and defense to automatic consequences of the technology of weapons is only one of the disservices done by quester s tendency to extrapolate backward from his organizing model the unique constraints imposed by global thermonuclear weaponry during the cold war the questionable invocations of historical trends causes and effects are too numerous to catalogue examples include the assertion that the significance of agriculture to warfare is the necessity it implies to defend territory whereas it seems more significant to mankind s development that agriculture uniquely promotes creation of the wealth and societal stability that alone enable long term conquest in another example quester overstates the influence of clausewitz on imperial germany suggesting that he taught the germans to be too total in waging war in the years prior to wwi this characterization of german strategic policy in the th century a policy that exemplified limited war for subsequent generations of strategists is oddly unwary at the very least the reader should be wary on encountering in the introduction such passages as these most of us during the cold war would have given marxist ideology credit for teaching the peoples under communist regimes to cease any hating of each other based on old ethnic differences p xiii well no i don t think most of us would this statement is made in service of quester s point that the technology of weapons is more malleable than human intentions have proven to be but again he misses the whole intermediate step of crafting the military execution of those intentions presuming that directing a war is no more complicated an act than pulling a trigger and that therefore the weapon is everything this is indeed the bottom line of the book quester has in mind the astrategic threat of nuclear weapons and that colors all his conclusions in the introduction to the edition he writes the highest goal of the weapons planner should be to design weapons systems that consistently and reliably reward the defense making it to everyone s advantage to do nothing in a crisis reading this on p xxxi one might be excused for seeing no great reason to continue further and with the exception of a few useful insights on the dynamics of balance of power politics and defensive alliances one would be right 
frustrated can t give any star but your system insist i have ordered the items twice and still have not received it by now because your shipping department have problem to provide the correct mailing address to dhl 
biased and unbalanced this book is badly written and not based on much logic the arguments are entirely unconvincing 
an expensive disappointment i ve admired mr faudrees work in traditional home magazine and just knew i would love the book unfortunately most of it was a rehash of photos and text i d seen before the rest was dull and tired if you are looking for something fresh and authentic this isn t the book for you 
hate book i was once a christian no more i grew up this book for what i picked up from the reviews is a hate book and nothing more it is the forcing of one religious views unto another person and all it will cause is war murder stupidity 
the canterbury tales by a modern hack poet this set of cds is a fraud ! nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not chaucer that is being read but a translation by some hack poet so if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the english language then this is the stuff for you but it is definitely not chaucer 
don t be fooled sounds up to date and i bought it thinking it new but tired forecasts from can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of avoid and think for yourself instead 
not so great this book was far to autobigraphical and the author s attempts to generalize her experience felt shallow i lost my only brother to suicide not long before reading the book it just didn t bring me any solace or increase my understanding on the other hand i also read no time to say goodbye and even though it was not aimed at siblings only i found it very helpful perhaps it was a matter of not just focusing on one single person s story 
something old something used two of the short stories in this book running out of dog and gone down to corpus are not new stories running out of dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from mr l writing about ironies and tragedies of average people but it should have been noted that of this book is not original the others are average reads over before we have any understganding of the characters mr lehane writes so well about none of the others are full of tension irony comedy tragedy and suspense we ve all come to expect they are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author s excellent reputation we waited a long time for another lehane this book certainly does not showcase his talents 
disappointing i thought this would have more actual crafts inside i expected the projects to be dated obviously hence the kitsch factor but they were plain tacky and a few required tough to find and or expensive supplies resin grapes anyone the illustrations are colorful and entertaining but it looks like the author just ripped off a bunch of old ads from the fifties and added a sparse amount of lame craft patterns like a really complicated lace doily as well as a difficult embroidery pattern with little or no help in the way of learning the stitches here and there for posterity it s better for someone who already has a strong background in crafting and doesn t mind filling in the considerable gaps in the instructions with their imagination don t waste your money 
an easy read that left me wanting i was so impressed that mr rubenstein had been named teacher of the year and that he used humor in his title that i really wanted to read his book many of us want to hear eachothers stories and gain knowledge new perspective or steal from another teacher s toolbox of tricks my opinion of mr rubenstein s experience is that he has become a hardened sarcastic and unresponsive teacher his theories and strategies are very last century and i do not mean while i applaud his ability to poke fun at himself to recognize that he is always under the microscope of his students and to have created a strategy that worked for him i cringe at the lessons humane societal responsive responsible that he s teaching his high school students my suggestion to all educators looking for a helpful book on classroom management and discipline is to first take a good long hard look at themselves and ask two questions first what do i want the children to learn second how am i planning hte activity for success 
interesting but flawed this is a messy book that succeeds to the degree that it does so despite its flaws some of the subjects are covered well some covered poorly and even where there is coverage the discussions are maddeningly inconsistent first the good author otto friedrich was energetic in finding many former residents of berlin as sources for this work and some of the best parts of the book are their colorful reminiscences of their lost and ruined city friedrich also included interesting chapters about the social milieu of the time particularly the cultural scene classical music drama and the nascent motion picture industry and there are some nice character sketches of some of the leading artists of the era lotte lenya bertolt brecht and various musicians in general despite the crazy quilt nature of the coverage friedrich is best on the social history aspects of berlin now the bad the book is very scattershot a mile wide but mostly an inch deep for example in the discussion of the german movie industry of the time although marlene dietrich and emil jannings are discussed peter lorre ernst lubistch and f w murnau are discussed only in passing among the pictorial artists george grosz is covered and discussed but becker nolde and scores of other artists get superficial or non existent coverage and maybe it is inevitable to try to discuss the tangled political history of the weimar era and the rise of the nazis in a history of berlin but friedrich is not a professional historian and his weaknesses in this area are glaring any reader with even a passing interest in the weimar era will find far better accounts of the politics of the period than friedrich s book and even if you grant that he needed to discuss the political events of the day in his work there s a lamentable lack of focus to his political coverage which mirrors the overall unevenness of this work for example his descriptions of the combat in the streets between the freikorps and the communists in the immediate post war period have the freshness and vitality that come from the testimony of eyewitnesses and they give the reader a sense for the chaos that became horrifyingly prevalent in berlin but his discussion of germany s policies toward the payment of reparations the dawes plan and the young plan etc is at best superficial and misleading if you read this book you might consider reading the sections that deal with the social history of the period and just skipping or finding better sources for the political history 
insulting to mentally healthy boys and men this book starts out with the affectation of being somehow applicable to modern man the author assumes modern men are broken and therefore must somehow be fixed and he offers his advice on how to go about being a real man therefore this book will appeal chiefly to boys and men who feel inadequate as males and men the same men who buy hummers and or guns and or beat women and abuse children to compensate for their wan manhood real or perceived the author portrays modern man as the victim to changing male roles while this is true for some boys and men it is by no means a universal trait any man who follows the dictates of his conscience and sense of honor and valor will know intrinsically what his role in life is he will also find this book insulting and absurd mentoring a boy and young man is a good thing however a young man must know when to slay his father and become a man himself the danger of mentoring is that of the alpha male mentality taking over and running a boy s or young man s life to his detriment when that occurs cultist mentality takes over a good and frightening example of this is robert bly himself taken too far this mentality leads to horrors such as the people s temple jim jones and his mass murder suicide heaven s gate scientology and a numberless other dangerous follow theleader mind setsfor those boys and men who feel they need such advice a far superior book is fire in the belly by sam keen it does not have the foreboding sense of victimization that iron john does and it is far better thought out as well as written 
back pain no more i thought the information was useful at times and other times i felt i needed a stronger back ground of schooling to understand the author overall good for understanding how the mind works but there are better books on exercises to help with my back pain buy a more up to date book 
nothing too inspiring i was disappointed with this purchase the cover is so cute but the only design that is really interesting is the pink and green hat with the pom poms that just isn t enough to warrant buying the whole book 
great title bad book this book is way too long for the substance it provides i expected to read a book that would help me work with smart executives instead as another reviewer noted this book focuses on high profile company disasters that were a result of bad strategic decisions by one or a few senior executives the book provided little insight into how this applied to other smart executives in organizations in fact there are many smart executives who have made good strategic decisions perhaps through the same process in this book yet their outcome was different i constantly was asking myself in this book what can i apply to other smart executives and i never got an answer the only good takeaway in this book is the importance of executives to create an environment where people are able to share different views and challenge the executive team i certainly knew this and expect most readers know this as well now you can provide a few examples of when this wasn t done and the dramatic ramifications i think this book tried to be the opposite of good to great yet didn t have nearly the analysis to back it up despite the length of the book 
pointless as someone who has read several books on watergate i have to ask why was this published it contains no new research no new interviews no revelations the entire book is cobbled together from other books which means that far too many important points and details are glossed over or ignored what s worse is olson s prose so flat and lackluster that it reads like a description of a senate appropriations bill rather than as the story of the greatest constitutional crisis of the th century don t be fooled by the inexplicable raves on the cover this is barely adequate at best for a thorough and compelling read on nixon s downfall read fred emery s watergate instead 
on drugs i give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from save your money this book is not worth either your time or your money was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe 
smug math book this is one of those math books where the authors enjoy making inexplicable leaps between equations that really don t follow in a smooth logical fashion one from another they are terrible at explaining things they like to boast that they are from stanford subtext implied if you are not from stanford you probably wouldn t understand it anyway you poor pitiful low income commoner i absolutely hate the tone of this book and the side comments in the margins are inane weak and mostly irritating i threw it aside in disgust and went back to warren weaver 
sloggish boring and trite not a very good book on any level not horrific but overall really lame a whodunit that you could never predict because there was nothing to predict it s like the author wrote the book and then when it came time to publish it chose a character at random that did it and wrote the last pages so save yourself some time read the last few pages and make up your own adventure 
drama and negativity i was hoping for a really good guide to the business side of interior design from an expert this book was reccomended to me by another professional in the business as the bible of the business i was hoping for insights for a well run prosperous effecient and positive business i was sorely disappointed this book is negative preachy outdated and angry written in a most uninspired manner and goes so far as to say things like if you want your own business you better be prepared to give up bridge tennis dinner with your family blah blah blah or quite frankly your contract is to protect you not your client hmmm really last i checked it is supposed to do both maybe it just does not represent the spirit in which i choose to do business i was hoping for advise from someone who is better at this than i am someone who may have streamlined the process and knows good time management all the drama and negativity pulls your energy from whatever good information is present i can see the wagging index finger of the writer as i read no thank you stell 
hate monger preaching more hate devisiveness this book not unlike mr robertson s other views and preachings tries to polarize americans to not be respective and inclusive of each other of course one would not expect anything less from the man who suggested that occurred because of the feminists gays and other folks who do not share robertson s beliefs my folks always taught me to be understanding compassionate and respectful of others even if they have different beliefs are of a different race sexual orientation religion et al maybe in the medieval times where mr robertson s views obviously come from the opposite was acceptable in it is simply not 
the truth shall prevail i would like to thank joan peters for confirming that concocting a fraud is still an american tradition the fallacious arguments presented in peters thesis are discredited by her active participation in commiting a fraud for anyone really interested in the facts about this book and the israel palestine conflict i highly recommend norman finkelstein s book image and reality of the israel palestine conflict supporters of joan peters are simply supporting the disinformation that has lead to the unbalanced opinion of the us today the rest of the world recognizes this piece of literature as a fraud please take the time to look at the evidence for yourself at www normanfinkelsteincom 
rather poor attempt at a boxing top ten list compilation some interesting lists mixed in with a lot of either fanboy or totally confusing lists of top fighters etc with little actual merit makes this a very hard book to get into

very disappointing after reading reviews here i decided to buy this book i love books by indian authors i am indian myself and really like the simplicity portrayed in such books however this one was not up to the mark a lot of things didn t make sense first of all how can devi s sister be so insensitive and think about x when her sister has just tried to commit suicide moreover is it possible for the entire family to be so mean to the mother who actually runs the house i had to skip many pages because it got to be such a drag i also did not like the writer s amateurish style of writing it reminded of sydney sheldon daniel steel books where certain feelings are exaggerated the writer also did not really give us a glimpse into the real psyche of the characters the story was cliched one sister is better than the other people compare them etc all in all i would just skip this book and move on to other rich indian books by talented writers i was seeking a book highlighting simplicity realistic indian families and an interesting sense of style i found neither in this book 
cute pictures but i m expecting my first child and my mother gave me this book because she knows i like animals especially the cute babies after reading the book though i was downright depressed to the point of tears about becoming a mother it basically tells you your children will be horrible terrors and not ever appreciate a thing you do and that your husband will be even worse ! the writing is bitter and twisted compared to the pictures i do give a couple stars because the pictures are cute if you don t read the text 
i caught a fish this big in let freedom ring sean hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth justice and the american way just the title represents everything true and good about him and america for his five star reviewers his message reinforces their pre conceived beliefs and hannity s words are the validation of those beliefs if this was written by a ghost writer he should have withheld payment if it wasn t written by a ghostwriter hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole the first chapter is written in a maudlin thosewerethegoodolddays wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity and a believer in the american dream but before you can say erin go braugh he is talking about the courage of george w bush for standing up to terrorism exactly how g w does he doesn t elaborate how he goes from grandfather to dubbya is a bit of magic hannitys next trick is to impugn clinton and gore as being soft on terrorism his source for this is of all people dick morris who knew the clintons and now works for the fox republican advocacy network he quotes morris who makes such vague statements as it seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism or they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism these morris mind reads are conjectural but hannity uses them which he does with impunity lets take a closer look at hannity s unimpeachable source for a moment it was dick morris who quit the clintons shortly after the second election it was morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers did some jail time and entered alcohol rehab you d think sh could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring but hannity doesn t skip a beat he points out how democrats such as senators kerry and daschle voted against certain defense spending bills what he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills or the many defense bills that kerry and daschle did vote for he never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by dick cheney when he was secretary of defense such deception is called propaganda propaganda is something that hannity has no compunction using here this he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked namely it is the story of president clinton being offered osama bin laden by the sudanese government again it s what he doesn t say that misdirects the reader sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave trading lifted however the fbi determined that the sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin laden the sudanese also made the offer to saudi arabia but the saudis had revoked bin laden s citizenship and refused to take him benjamin franklin said statistics is a liar hannity uses charts for the same purpose he shows how under reagan the army bought over tanks under clinton the army bought none this leads one to the assumption that clinton did nothing for the services he doesn t mention that the army buys tanks not presidents he doesn t mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the soviet union that never came he doesn t mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles be grateful that hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history if he could instead of seeing a dead captain ahab being killed by the whale in moby dick we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption i caught a fish this big ! theres something very fishy about his facts his historical parallels which aren t parallel and what he chooses to tell you and what he chooses to leave out in this book he tells whale sized whoppers ! 
save your time i bought this book because all the positive reviews convinced me that it might be worth reading my hunch wasted more than a few hours of my life the book uses the harry potter series as a springboard to discuss various philosophical problems after finishing the book though i can t say that i ve gained any deeper understanding of philosophy or harry potter whatsoever take for instance ethics one writer essentially summarizes one aspect the naturalist view if god doesn t exist then morality doesn t either and the christian view god does exist and morality is indispensable the end to say that the editors skim the surface with this work is akin to saying that plato liked to think about stuff next consider the editor s treatment of courage says the writer readers you can build up courage by preparation no really hear me out on this ! know that if you fail there will be consequences friends can give you support too says the reader oh my god i can t believe i just used my hard earned cash on this this will be the most expensive toilet paper i ve ever purchased perhaps i was expecting too much perhaps i was wrong for being disappointed at receiving a collection of infuriatingly childish essays vaguely connecting harry potter to philosophy with all the grace of a floundering fish washed up onto the shore perhaps i was wrong but i seriously doubt it if you re expecting what i was from this book some food for thought look elsewhere it does not provoke thought nor does it provide entertainment in this book s stead i recommend the enlightening looking for god in harry potter by john granger i am hardly religious but the truth is the potter series is religious in tone very much so in fact granger contends that the potter series is classically symmetrical and alchemical in form he provides insights rather than platitudes sadly editors branding a book with aristotle s moniker and mentioning him once every pages does not make your work profound it only underscores just how profound it is not 
shoddy reserched novel i purchased this book a week ago and hardly impressed by mr laurence gardner s extremely shoddy scholarship and laughable gullibility the book reads more like a novel rather than a well researched historical book indeed bloodline of the holy grail is more novel than historical fact let us begin by investigating the forwarder of this novel which the author intends to market as the historical fact lawrence gardner traces the supposed blood line of jesus christ to the hrh prince michael stuart of albany who in fact writes the forward to mr gardner s book so who exactly is this prince of albany well our prince of albany turns out to be a self styled prince of albany one among his numerous self bestowed titles an imposter born not of the stewart bloodline it ended with prince henry cardinal stuart in around but of common stock as michael lafosse of belgian pedigree no scottish much less stewart blue blood flows in this imposter s veins a little background research by the perhaps gullible mr gardner could have ousted mr lafosse from his throne using and placing exclusive emphasis on the gnostic heretical writings which appeared between a d and a d far later than the synoptic gospels a d a d further stretches the imagination testimonial evidence of the authenticity devoid of imagined catholic manipulation of the gospel texts speaks to the fact that all but seven verses of the of all four gospels can be constructed wholly by original works by commentators on the gospel who lived between a d to a d long before the supposed writing of the first gnostic gospel rather the gnostic gospels are nothing more than another piece of writing much like the joseph smith s book of mormon mr gardner alleges without proof that jesus christ s apostles were princes magicians and doctors with the exception of peter and andrew he gives these all apostles numerous aliases with the exception of peter who has none in mr gardner s book which quite frankly is confusing the fact remains that the only apostle who had an alias simon better known as peter is the only one devoid of an alias in mr gardner s book in short mr gardner seems to seek to capitalize on market trends in which any book with freemasonry underpinnings are faddish and hip hardly a launch platform for any historical research bloodlines of the holy grail is a shoddy novel that masquerades as honest historical research in summation poor novel even poorer historical novel and a gullible charlatan for a novelist 
airy fairy stuff i believe that life is too short and books that really deserve to be read too plentiful not to mention movies worth watching games worth playing for anyone to spend more than five minutes on this book it s amazing how marketing can help sell such fluffy material any time i recommend if you want to write by brenda ueland instead 
the only europeans you will find in belgium live in brussels after hearing so much about the book i must admit to a disappointment in its contents as a belgian that has immigrated to the usa i am well familiar with the many contrasts between europe and the us and found mr reid s observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness for example mr reid appears enamored with the european welfare state vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new european identity that is superior to the barbarous american model but admits in small print in its appendix that the european welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the us social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form i felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state i thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness i felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between europe and america 
an interesting science book by a reporter for the most part the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book s printing but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms be warned there are several places where the book goes awry for example the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal occasionally hunting in pairs problem no tracks of a t rex have been discovered to date a decade and a half after the writing aside from that and a few other points though the book is good reading 
a little disappointing i am a fan of kary odiatu as a competitor and fitness model in many magazines i bought this book on a recommendation of an acquaintaince as well as the fact ms odiatu and her husband were the authors as a personal trainer i try to find books that would be well suited for my clients i was up to page wondering when anything of real value beyond a lot of rah rah was going to appear sadly that did not happen even the chapters that were designed to enlighten about shopping and training were basically hollow i was gravely disappointed in this book and even find it quite perfunctory and remedial for even a beginner to the lifestyle while i do appreciate the emotional support and you can achieve it sentiment it was most repetitive and truly took away pages and pages from what could have been a wonderful book if it ever got past the cheerleading and proceeded deeper into fitness i strongly recommend christine lydon s book look hot live long beth horn s book the natural way or bodyfitness for women your way to physical perfection written by gerard thorne and phil embleto 
worthless book no table of contents and pathetic index we couldn t find any of the collectibles on which we needed information and the index was the worst i ve ever seen ! i felt totally ripped off with this book but it would cost more to return than it was worth maybe i can find an antique outhouse and supply it with a fresh price guide 
tasteless and bland i was excited as i flipped through the pages of this cookbook many of the recipes sounded tantalizing and all the color photos displayed tasty looking dishes however after trying out my first recipe the curried tempeh and grains both myself and my dining companion were rather let down we found the dish incredibly bland and not at all what we had expected despite the dissatisfying first attempt i didn t let that deter me from trying again surely the thai inspired broccoli w coconut sauce could not fail well it did again neither of us clamored for seconds as the dish lacked any real flavor or punch one would expect of something inspired by thai food again and again this cookbook failed to satisfy definitely not a keeper 
thin and padded out i ve always enjoyed sara paretsky s novels despite the left wing preaching in the past this has been subordinated to character plot but not here there s not much plot a few elements here there it never really drives the story far too much space is given to the standard left wing caricature of the rich the repetitive boring stereotyping of family values as just so much plutocratic hypocrisy ms paretsky we know you hate the american rich they re probably as hideous as you paint them to be but here they re just cardboard cut out characters and of course the book is just a long boring wait to see just how the filthy rich committed the crime how they ll get away with it plus the satisfying way in which the horrible rich are once again forced to cough up the money they at first of course refused to give this is getting tedious 
spare your th grader let me start by stating that im a year old university educated individual this book was thrusted into my face and forced into my brain when i was in forth grade it was by far the most driest and boring book i ve ever read at that point in my life and continue to be so until college now i dont remember anything at all about this book other than the fact it was about some boy writing letters to some man but the fact that i dont remember anything gives you an idea at how little i stimulted till this day im reluctant to even bother to re read this book and give it another chance i ve been scarred for life i have no doubt that this books contains a lot of substance and insightful tales but the thought of reading some poor pathetic boy s letters causes me to shriver if i would have to chose any book of my childhood that discouraged me from reading more it would have to be this please spare your child student from the tortures of this book maybe once they ve grown mentally and have the capacity and patience to understand it it would be a great book but at such a young age its a horrible read i noticed that this book recieved some high marks from young readers for some reason i feel that those ratings may be incorrect and the young children s opinions may have been clouded do you teacher s know no shame 
was the author left behind in school this series may be good for a laugh some of the writing is engaging but the premise is absurd why in this day and age should anyone accept the world view of the bible a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe s beliefs and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt sinai in a sense bible believers have been left behind since the s enlightenment tom paine s the age of reason showed the god of the bible to be a cruel vindictive monster and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations the ravings of a madman read this series if you like enjoy parts of it but make no mistake to take any of this seriously you have to regress to a prehistoric world view before men learned to think to ask questions before logic or science a time when dazed superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth if they didn t grovel humbly enough to their supposed god do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one when the sheep are raptured up to heaven their clothes are left behind so heaven is a nudist colony the basic contradiction of course lies in using worldly action some of it exciting to proselytize for the unworldly the supernatural but why should we care whether any of the good guys gets killed and why should they mind won t they go straight up to heaven that s what they want isn t it why even lift a finger against the bad guys didn t christ say resist not evil worried about who will win god is infinitely powerful so jesus who is of god or something like that is sure to win when armageddon rolls around in book of the series and the sheep the believers will happily worship him looking just like the pictures of dim witted bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah s witnesses leave at your door the going price for a used copy of tribulation force is one cent does that tell you something actually the story telling is worth more the basic premise is worth less perhaps it averages out 
poor history lesson i had to use this book in an undergraduate course it is extremely biased and the author on many instances goes way over the line into editorializing it is a poor example of true history but an excellent example of revisionist history in chapter the author states but in history we care as much about what people believe to have happened as we do about the literal truth any time a historian puts as much emphasis on tales as much as fact they are on thin academic ice 
coffee table chicken coop book i was aware that there were no building plans based on other reviews but i wasn t too worried because of i can make materials lists pretty easily from drawings however i was surprised that the drawings in this book have incorrect measurements rather frustrating this is a coffee table book and even as that it s not so exciting there were really only a few designs that broke away from the square box chicken coop idea the best thing about this book is the presentation of the idea of keeping chickens as being an urban middle class phenomenon it was good for ideas but it s not a keeper 
inconvenient and incomplete if you seriously collect or sell hull pottery skip this book only the most expensive pieces have color pictures and valuations but even for many of these you will only find small black and white pictures and no valuations furthermore almost of the book is merely reprints from old hull catalogs with no valuations included valuations are inconveniently listed in the back of the book which requires a lot of page flipping very convenient for the publisher who only has to update this section rather than the entire book i get the impression that this book was merely published to profit off the interest of collectors but not really intended to serve the collector s needs 
this man talks nonsense this book is a good idea in principle but clever clogs mr maltin seems to know nothing about films whiles he raves about old fashioned stinkers such as citizen kane casablanca and psycho he is far less complimentary about classics such as weekend at bernie s gremlins and police academy assignment miami beach i think mr maltin should learn to keep his so called opinions to himself in future verdict a very expensive doorstop 
not very good i ve read close to outlines on bible prophecy watchers a sincere but sadly poor guide the information s winded sorry marilyn hickey 
dear god please think of the children or falafel amazon truly did you all a favor by mercifully offering you an excerpt of ten whole pages of mr o reillys book this was a luxury i was not given and now i can t help but feel it s too late for my poor soul i stomached the whole enchilada and i warn you this is one mexican or wet back as mr o reilly ocassionally refers to people of mexican origin dish you do not wish to tackle the first ten pages alone tell you exactly what kind of person bill o reilly is it is obvious that this iteration of this children s edition of his wildly asinine the o reilly factor is just another attempt to gouge his enamored viewers for more money this book offers no real advice that cannot be already garnored by the occasional disney channel blurb or the elusive common sense it takes him two precious pages to explain to his obviously mentally ill readers that real friends are not anything like those on the show friends being a fan of the show i have to agree with o reilly but then i d be forced to ask what the hell bill he recently settled a lawsuit pressed against him for a rumored million by a ms mackris for sexual harassment he attempts to teach our children about sex but is himself a barely disguised chauvenist and borderline deviant his previous the o reilly factor has it s own section on sex here he shows just how little respect for woman and boastfully describes many of his sexual conquests in his fiction novel those who tresspass he self inserts himself as an irresistable and dangerous womanizer feel free to use the main character in this novel as a personality guide for o reilly himself he is desperately and consistently seeking admiration from his audience it s both sad and sickening he barely alludes to his rambunctious childhood misadventures with his friends trying to pass by his readers what he learned from those experiences however both his massively depressingly popular cable news show and his series of near toxic books reveal a man borderline insane he s rediculously angry at the most obnoxiously inane things a chronic liar and has the memory span of an year old hamster with alzheimers he will literally make points in this book and provide evidence that counters his own argument his show is no different he will make wildly offensive comments when his callers call him up on it he has his chronies replay the tape of course in the year we are completely unable to actually replay this tape on modern television for viewers as you can see when his chronies shout back off camera a completely different statement he has never apologized for his actions only grunting with simian aggression and angrily moving on to the next segment this man cannot hold multiple marriages yet he attempts to teach children about relationships mr o reilley is to televised journalism what pornography is professional photography any person who truly consider themselves a conservative should be horrified by how he represents the demographic a recent example is of a jewish man who called into his show to make his case that having christmas during school as he grew up made him feel uncomfortable because he felt constantly pressured to be more christian o reilly responded by telling the man that if he didn t want to live in a christian nation he should move to israel any truly religious person whether christian muslim jewish or buddhist should find a comment like this wildly offensive well perhaps the buddhists will let that one go in a country where religious freedom is one of it s main tenets perhaps o reilly would be advised to know that a marginal amount of secularism in public and government institution is necessary for religious freedom the founding fathers considered religion a largely personal matter as did jesus render unto caesar s what is caesar s but i digress as several reviewers before me have already stated their is no real advice to be taken from these pages it is a shameless attempt to slip into his fans pocketbooks please do not support bill o reilly he is a hack journalist he does not cite sources and he both dilberately and unknowingly misinterprets data graphs his debates are nothing more than one sided scream fests where the slightest hint of losing is barbarically avoided by screaming to his producers cut the mic he is just one more piece of evidence that the fox news channel can take any angry opinionated moron and turn them into a popular media icon this man is literally a danger to our country please do not endanger your children as well the chances of accidental death are marginally better bringing a handgun into the home than the o reilly factor for kids he lowers political commentary to the standards of jerry springer he may be loud and entertaining but he is also manipulative and not very good at hiding it please factor fans attempt to see what a horrible man he really is when you ignore this review and read through these demonic pages consider this a review for each of his nonfiction books as i have read them all and each is written in progressively poorer quality 
where is it i ordered this book and eventually amazon cancelled the order because it was not available the then ask me to review it where is it rev bruce 
awful i really don t understand the fantastic reviews this book seems to get i thought it was horrible i was incredibly dissapointed after i picked it up i thought the story line was ridiculous the language used was not authentic and the characters weren t believeable i hated it 
contrived convoluted plot twists with no backbone contrived bloated disconnected unrealistic to the extreme the good wolfsschanze the bad wolfsschanze the nachrichtendienst the odessa the sonnenkinder the rache good god what does ludlum do but think up another covert cult when he needs a new plot twist or another shoot emupscene the motivations of all these various groups are weak and thin and improbable trying to keep it all straight is difficult made more so by that fact that each is just a thin veneer for a plot twist after a while you no longer care for those interested in the general plot a much better alternative would be robert harris s fatherland 
worthless this book as the other olivia books is witty and creative unfortunately the book is rendered worthless and inappropriate by the poor content olivia lies yes all children enjoy fantasy but when she s directly asked for the truth she lies again most kids will try that at least once but for olivia there are no consequenses what an awful message for children it gets worse she shows a very negative attitude about her boring uniform that she has to wear to school what a brat and at the end she intentionally defies her mother and of course no consequenses blech it s worthless which is too bad because this author definately has talent 
dragging out the same joke for far too long swartzwelder is the best writer on the simpsons staff bar none but his prose style leaves so much to be desired what works within the context of a voiced animated show falls flat on its face in print swartzwelder revisits the character of frank burly p i last seen in the time machine did it that earlier novel worked even though the joke got a litle long inthetooth at the end here the attempt to once again meld film noirish black andwhite movie cliches with s ish science fiction this time an alien invasion that only burly is too stupid to realize is happening cannot even elicit a guffaw some may feel burly is simply homer recast as phillip marlowe but even homer would remember to be you know funny in this case the formula very quickly becomes burly almost discovers invasion incident causes burly great pain burly forgets there is an invasion it just does not hold up maybe those who read this book without reading its predeccesor will enjoy it more as they will be unfamiliar with the formula for those who are attracted purely by the writer of the simpsons blurb you re better off buying any of the dvds and passing on this 
terrible this is the first grafton book i ve read but i m pretty sure it will be my last simply put this is the worst book i ve read in the past year the plot is ridiculous it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute porn star water treatment plant worker the characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator s questions critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense 
didn t interest me i found this book boring her message was good but her delivery did nothing for me 
boring i am years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book i have ever opened i say opened because i just could not finish it i was doing fine until i reached his section about the future of computers i had to skip the entire section about pages or so it along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand at least for a year old after that the book just kept going downhill and i gave up this book is not interesting in the least avoid at all costs 
good but not worth the effort i felt like this book never took off like most grisham novels do it was predictable throughout the novel and the ending was so abrupt i felt like grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere so we ll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character i do really enjoy a good grisham novel and have to admit that he is my favorite author but i just didn t enjoy this one 
not much better than astrology while this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers don t exist i ll admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality but just how far can we take this kind of analysis the author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same sex parent he can determine the birth order of your ideal match my father was rd and i was nd thus i should pair with a th born anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo science there are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions not every nth born is the same and no relationship between nth and mth borns can be analysed this way as with astrology the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong sign who s to say i won t get along with a nd born rather than relying on voodoo like this we are better off just paying attention to how we actually get along with other individuals 
a botched extension of a great short novel having read some of gregory benford s work i was greatly disapointed by quotbeyond the fall of night quot his attempt to spin an addition on clarke s short novel was a blunder it s astonishing that he didn t pick up on an essential point of clarke s original story and proceeded to write himself into the ground like an aircraft with no glide path more surprising was that clarke allowed this to be published i wondered if he even reviewed works like this 
magnum obfuscation if you absolutely have nothing better to do one day try wading through eisenman s prolix and heavily befogged dissection of his own crudely assembled theoretical positions it is one of the failings of current architectural writing that it s authors seem compelled to make seemingly simple things unnecessarily complex and to an intelligent reader ie one not taken in by the industry s self laudatory stances it is evident that few of these authors have anything worthwhile to offer real architectural or urban discourse in the world of contemporary architectural speculation peter eisenman is the weakest of the amateur hour theorists playing word games in the quasi philosophical sandbox of his many failings the most pernicious is that he lacks the basic ability to distinguish between assumption and fact and lacking any really systematic approach to reasoning quasiderrida one day pseudo foucault the next all incidentally deeply misunderstood he takes the usual academic low road of clouding his conjectural positions in vague and deliberately impenetrable prose remarkably unreasonable and capricious suppositions are here presented as though a valid design methodology never one to be phased by a lack of substantive evidence eisenman merely invents a loosely fitting diagram to substantiate his thesis his improbable dotted lines and diagonals may seem to suggest great import but the careful reader will have fun spotting the many inconsistencies and contradictions in the logic that is randomly applied not to put to fine a point on it this book is nonsense overly dressed up in obtuse semantic verbiage there is nothing of value in this bloated and extremely tedious volume 
not broke down well i can t get into this book nor can i find what i m looking for because it s not broke down well make up don t break up is way better and explains why people are scared 
poorly explained i have a university maths degree and found the book very obvious and drawn out for the first few chapters in spite of this i looked forward to what was going to be explained later suddenly from a very simple and easy to understand explanation on the emh he starts to use mathematics in his equations that i had a lot of difficulty following there was very little or no explanation of how these equations were arrived at and a lot of mathematics and statisics is assumed this book does not apply the theory in ny meaningful way to the markets let alone the capital markets in my opinion i found that i took very little away from this book and would not recommend it to anyone who has basic mathematics like myself or is looking for some deeper insight into the markets i would hate to have mr peters as a teacher based on his book 
a too early mcbain the gutter and the grave is a re issue of an early mcbain who had not quite hit the stride that makes him an immortal of the genre clearly dated even given the fact that it was written in the dialogue lacks authenticity a hard boiled detective lieutenant dismissing an obviously phony alibi as horse manure and the realism of the th precinct novels is clearly lacking the overnight decent of the hero from succesful private eye to bowery bum because of his wife s infidelity is a bit over the top as is machinations of the other characters the prime suspect is jailed in minutes of the first murder and sits there througout the novel s other murders all committed by the same gun without seeking legal counsel the alcoholic hero who is always in full control of his faculties and apprently has not lost any his athleticismnor his allure to every woman he meets in the novel taxes credulity if gutter is to be the last mcbain it was not a grand exit i hope there is an th precinct lurking somewhere 
cult propoganda the truth is that a newly sober alcoholic named william griffith wilson a down onhisluck former wall street hustler who put on airs of having once been a prosperous stock broker just sat down in december of and wrote up twelve commandments for the new religious group that he and fellow alcoholic doctor robert smith had started those commandments were simply a repackaged version of the practices of a cult religion that was popular at that time something called the oxford group or the oxford group movement and later moral re armament a religious cult that was created by a deceitful fascist renegade lutheran minister named dr frank nathan daniel buchman a nut case who actually praised adolf hitler and heinrich himmler bill wilson described the writing of the twelve steps this way well we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this book was all about and how this deal works as i told you this had been a six step program then the idea came to me well we need a definite statement of concrete principles that these drunks can t wiggle out of there can t be any wiggling out of this deal at all and this six step program had two big gaps which people wiggled out of notice how bill wilson considered his fellow alcoholics to be a bunch of cheaters who will wiggle out of this deal if they can get away with it which bill won t allow and note how bill wilson made himself the leader who was entitled to dictate the concrete terms of other people s recovery programs also notice how bill wilson considered spiritual development to be a business deal with a contract that you can t wiggle out of something like selling your soul in trade for sobriety nowhere in the twelve steps does it say that you should quit drinking or help anyone else to quit drinking either nowhere do the words sobriety recovery abstinence health happiness joy love or love appear in the twelve steps the word alcohol was only mentioned once where it was patched into the first step as a substitute for the word sin bill wilson wrote we are powerless over alcohol and our lives have become unmanageable instead of the oxford group slogan we are powerless over sin and have been defeated by it and then the phrase especially alcoholics was patched into the th step as a suggested target for further recruiting efforts we tried to carry this message to others especially alcoholics but regular non alcoholic people were still fair game for recruiting into bill s spiritual fellowship the twelve steps are not a formula for curing or treating alcoholism and they never were the twelve steps are not spiritual principles and they never were the twelve steps are cult practices that work to convert people into confirmed true believers in a proselytizing cult religion just like frank buchman s so called spiritual principles did the twelve steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems the a a failure rate ranges from to sometimes the a a success rate is actually less than zero which means that a a indoctrination is positively harmful to people and prevents recovery some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving a a treatment one of the most enthusiastic boosters of alcoholics anonymous professor george vaillant of harvard university who is also a member of the board of trustees of alcoholics anonymous world services inc aaws showed by his own years of testing of a a that a a was worse than useless that it didn t help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested a death rate that professor vaillant himself described as appalling while trying to prove that a a treatment works professor vaillant actually proved that a a kills after years of a a treatment the score with dr vaillant s first alcoholic patients was sober dead and still drinking nevertheless vaillant is still a trustee of alcoholics anonymous and he still wants to send all alcoholics to a a anyway to get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high status healer that is cult religion not a treatment program for alcoholism the a a dropout rate is terrible most people who come to a a looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith healing the a a meeting room has a revolving door the therapists judges and parole officers many of whom are themselves hidden members of a a or n a continually send new people to a a but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what a a really is even a as own triennial surveys conducted by the a a headquarters the gso say that of the newcomers are gone within days are gone in months and are gone at the end of a year that automatically gives a a a failure rate of at least but the gso does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting they don t qualify as members that amounts to cherrypicking if we included them then the numbers would be much worse first there is the propaganda technique of everybodys doing it aa or a similar twelve step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries that is a complete falsehood the vast majority of the successful people recover without a a or any support group it s what everybody is doing then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions it is widely believed that not including a twelve step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse it is widely believed by whom and what do those unnamed people know what are their qualifications are they doctors medical school professors or salesmen for a step treatment center why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe anyway the authors also use the propaganda technique of fear mongering you will be on the road to relapse you will probably die unless you practice bill wilson s twelve step cult religion and then the fluff headed pollyanna attitude is outrageous just going to the wonderful a a meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics but since a a has a zero percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission that cannot possibly be true 
good book but don t listen to the audio version i have listened to and enjoyed many books on cd in the past few years this reader is among the worst that i ve had the displeasure of hearing the content of this book is great so don t get me wrong however the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended he pronounces many character names incorrectly including carpathia and adbullah his character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and or annoying especially carpathia s his voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue he also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason these are just the most obvious and annoying problems there are too many to list completely here so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
what ok pages of cliff notes for a page book that is absurd ! night is a classic work filled with vivid metaphor and intensely emotional characters you could get a third of the way through it in the time it would take to buy the cliff notes 
sort of like shag carpet it s really sort of a trip back in time reading this book so much of it probably worked pretty well in when this was written but the translation in doesn t quite make it trendy young dr delaware age drives a cadillac seville and when it s disabled he rents a boxy japanese car lot s of amusing things crop up like that in this book which actually made me sort of nostalgic i had to go listen to old hall oates lp s to re visit say it isn t so and maneater again ! it also has a central convention of the s that i m currently sick to death of strugglingimpoverished minorities good guys white affluent successful christian men who conspire bad guys honestly this formula is more stereotypical than the butler did it used to be if you spot a successful white guy early in a story especially if it s suggested that he s a christian he s probably the bad guy if kellerman wrote this book in it probably couldn t get published its way too formulaic ! consequenly a big part of my dislike of this book is because of this it doesn t stop there however many reviews here suggest that jonathan kellerman is a great writer i think he s marginal at best i think these characters are really pretty shallow and the whole idea of this psychologist single handedly solving crimes and beating up bad guys twice his size is goofy delaware points a gun at central villians on separate occasions in the story and they admit to everything but their shoe size try to imagine patrick kenzie or harry bosch pointing a gun at a bad guy and having said bad guy collapse and outline every last element of the crime in great detail it reminded me of those old perry mason shows where perry always seems to get a witness to break down in open court and admit to his or her crime in front of a packed court room here s a suggestion if you want to read a good mystery with child abuse as a theme read dennis lehane s gone baby gone jonathan kellerman should be writing scripts for tv detective shows like barnaby jone 
not for beginners or the mildly apathetic this book is very comprehensive which is either a blessing or curse depending on your background as someone who knew nothing about islam prior to reading this book i was frequently overwhelmed by the mass of information that lapidus has arranged as you may notice by the sheer volume of this page book it is very wordy like most history texts it is also very dry and devoid of emotion the author does however provide a complex view of islam that is fair and accurate 
not what i expected at all after a long wait to be released i ve been waiting for this book to come out because i thought it would have information on a chinese wedding that i could share with my daughter the books has very little information on chinese weddings other than why a bride wears red which is a lucky color and the traditional wedding outfit i was hoping for more infomation like the tea ceremony and other things this book is basically about a young girl that fears that her uncle will no longer have a special place in her heart and life for her once he gets married and the artwork is not what i d call the best for me this was a long wait for just a ok book this book could have had great potiental and done so much more 
very disappointing this is the story of cassie who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young indian policeman who just arrived in la cassie suffers from amnesia and we don t know what brought her there until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife this is by far the most disappointing of picoult s books and i ve read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers cassie is amnesic yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened the story goes back and forth between the present the past the memories and leaves readers lost in the middle i was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion what is frustrating is that it takes picoult pages to make her character realise the obvious i also found cassie to be unreliable and unappealing let alone her husband alex a massive egocentric the story was very confused mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in africa with anthropology indian legends domestic violence alcoholism amnesia it was just too much for one book and the message was confused if you want a superb story of domestic violence read black blue by anna quindlen if you want a good picoult book read the pact or my sister s keeper but definitely not picture perfect 
zero stars if they had that option i really have to say that this is the worst management book i read moreover the book is full of clich s i kept reading it expecting that the good part was coming but there was no good part ! i eventually reached the end of the book where he says if you don t try you will never know and dont let anything grind you down as if these were very revealing statements this is what we tell little kids and we all learned this when we were years old and i find pitiful that the author has no other ideas to conclude his book with i would never recommend this book to anyone in any business field 
gotham not concerned with accuracy perhaps the girth of this work makes it difficult to check all the facts but i found gross inaccuracies throughout the authors are biased and totally unconcerned with representing historical truthfulness the references to aaron burr in this book are perfunctory snide or downright malicious the first mention of burr i found was on page regarding the battle of brooklyn where the authors state howes dallying gave putnam and the rest of the army guided by lieutenant aaron burr time to slip out of new york they fail to mention that burr debating with general knox as to the wisdom of remaining took it upon himself to address the men and take charge in the ensuing retreat they met the enemy during which burr distinguished himself with coolness deliberation and valor his meritorious services to the army on that day rendered him an object of peculiar respect from the troops wandell menningerode yet burrows and wallace merely accord him a perfunctory nod on page they state among the new assemblymen that year was aaron burr making his political debut with no principles to speak of snide and unnecessarily insulting hamilton on the other hand receives page after page of high eulogism and the authors take great pains to speak of him wherever possible with the greatest regard in chapter they state hamilton treated the convention to a remarkable five hour lecture i wonder if the philadelphia convention felt that enduring a five hour diatribe was a treat though i must admit hamilton s ability to ramble on at such length is indeed remarkable the authors choose words for hamilton which are positive for burr negative they describe burr when he was the front runner for jefferson s running mate as too young too pushy too devious words they claim were said by many democratic republicans though they fail to say who they go on to say burr even dammed minetta creek to create a grand ornamental pool by the main gate of richmond hill by inserting the word even they insinuate that he committed a heinous act rather than improved his property snide and misleading in the five paragraphs dedicated to the interview in weehawken they state that the impetus for the challenge was hamilton s remark that he looked upon mr burr to be a dangerous man and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government while hamilton certainly made this comment it was not the one that burr felt was demeaning to his honor it was the still more despicable opinion statement that compelled burr to demand an explanation though several letters passed between hamilton and burr prior to the duel the only reference this book acknowledges is hamilton let it be known that his remarks turned wholly on political topics and did not attribute to col burr any instance of dishonorable conduct nor relate to his private character burr nevertheless demanded an interview on the field of honor this cannily shifts the blame totally onto burr making hamilton seem like an innocent victim which he was not furthermore in describing the duel they state that burr aimed and fired hamilton fell mortally wounded and burr fled they fail to mention that hamilton not only fired but probably fired first again by misrepresenting burr they lionize hamilton the section ends with facing a murder indictment and fearing his house would be attacked by a mob he slipped out of town into obloquy everlasting this won a pulitzer prize i think they wrote the passage just for the opportunity to use the word obloquy indeed if not for books and authors like these burr might get the recognition he deserves rather than the kind of calumny they write in a passage on prostitution they mention madame jumel saying she did however manage a short lived marriage with the equally notorious aaron burr malicious i could cite more passages where he is mentioned either with contempt or disregard but i think the point is made the bibliographical list for this book is so extensive they can only list authors without titles or page references i finally found lomask milton and kline maryjo i presume mentioned but i have to wonder if they actually read any books on burr or took the time to study his papers surely learned people who do in depth research should at some point come the conclusion that history has dealt unfairly with aaron burr and stop this ongoing character assassination burrows and wallace seize every opportunity to denigrate burr while neglecting to use a single accolade when fitting occasions arise it is distressing that in opinions of aaron burr remain this convoluted i do not recommend anyone to buy this book 
hated it i m a huge jeffery deaver fan and until this book had never read one of his tomes that i didn t absolutely love bloody river blues was anything but spectacular in my opinion and it was a struggle to even get to the end character development was fair but not the usual style i ve come to enjoy from deaver i never really knew john pellam like an intimate friend and was only given tidbits of information about him along the way a few more scraps were thrown out but most seemed unimportant subcharacters were also underdeveloped even the villain was so underdeveloped that when the identity was known it was anticlimactic one of my favorite characters was the paralyzed cop but his story was often short changed his doctor could have been developed to give so much more to the story but she never was and it left me lacking enthusiasm for the storyline and his chanting nutsy wife could have been fun but again she was almost mentioned in passing and nothing more said the main plot was fair but not something that would grab the reader and not let go in fact i kept putting this book down and it was difficult to muddle my way through it the subplots were tossed in with no clear reason behind them for example the subplot that has john pellam trying to sell his own movie script so he can make it into a film himself had me scratching my head and saying so what i really didn t care and didn t see what relevance it had in the big picture the other subplots were similar and left me wondering why they took up page space overall this book was just a tad below average but for a jeffery deaver book to even be average is a very unusual thing his books usually grab me from the beginning and i lose sleep trying to finish them if anything bloody river blues put me to sleep ! i d definitely skip this one and read anything else by deaver 
would prefer to rate this as biloxi blues is nothing like brighton beach memoirs so if you re hoping for more of the same don t bother eugene is very different more mature still obsessed with sex nonetheless the humor is much more crude than the first play and much darker eugene is not in this play a lot which may explain my lack of laughing i couldn t warm up to any of the characters like i did in brighton beach memoirs even though i was disappointed with this play i ll still read the third play of this trilogy i do not recommend 
weak arguments full of hubris adams uses typical arguments meant to disarm traditional theists too bad the arguments are weak and tired by the way the only person who can say that all the roads lead up to the top of the mtn is the person who sees and knows all roads i don t know anyone truly that arrogant who believes he knows all religious systems especially since there have been thousands of them ! beyond the thought experiment there is little to commend here it might be best if mr adams were to stick to his comics 
for those who like this kind of book if you think you d find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting then you ll enjoy this book 
if you like hopeless this book is for you if you enjoy hopeless and depressing also if you have the ability to enjoy the twist of words without being wrapped in the subject matter however if you believe life has a purpose you ll find yourself wondering why you read it i do believe a talented preacher could take these stories and say this my beloved is why you need god i know the stereotype currently is that educated people love proulx it s only the uneducated buffoons that can t get her that don t like her i guess i ll sit over in the uneducated section at least we have better books on the shelves 
review of quotten days that shook the world quot although this book may be so brilliantly written by john reed i found it to be too laden with historical details and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her himself with the makings of the russian revolution for the first time the book provides with a glossary of russian terms events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so i found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there however due to my lack of knowledge of russian history i was unable to piece together any of the information so in frustration i gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a quothistory buff quot from this experience i learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book the rest of the book should be written according to that outline a glossary of main events would also be helpful on the other hand i do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner anyway if you would like to expand your knowledge about the russian revolution i highly recommend this book however if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts 
not worth reading in the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but i started to get board around the middle and had to put it down the story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading if i were you i would skip the reading of this boo 
a morality play overall i felt that this book could have been and should have been much better the ever increasing level of credit card debt is a real problem as are the abuses of sub prime lenders but the author s perception and description of the problem is often off and the proposed solutions are inadequate the author offers a morality play in which the merchants of greed victimize both the poor and the middle class while convincing users of convenience to think of themselves as more virtuous than the debt ridden even though their perks come at the expense of the less fortunate no doubt our ancestors would be horrified to watch us incur debt to buy a pair of shoes fill the gas tank or buy a restaurant meal but their horror would come from not from morality but from fear in their time mortgaging the farm often led to its loss and mortgaging one s future income might lead to the poorhousetoday there is a balance which the author does not acknowledge between easy credit which leads some users to max out and restricted credit which prevents most low income people from obtaining a credit card speaking as one who lived for years on a near minimum wage salary i d have to say that it was to my benefit to obtain a card because although i could not afford to own a car i could occasionally afford to rent one and the internet functions somewhat as sears did years ago in that if the local merchants charge too much one has a ready alternative in this author s morality play credit merchants appear as the devil and the devil s voice is advertising thus welfare moms obtain bedroom sets they can t afford from rent acenter because its hard not to succumb to the industry s aggressive marketing campaigns but we re talking about adults and there are alternatives i did not buy entertainment products i could not afford and when i could afford them but local merchants charged too much i ordered through the mail orfor more portable items took a bus to a discount store for furniture i bought from a salvation army thrift store and hired a truck to take it home the point is not that i was more virtuous than a rac customer but some people s lives are just too chaotic to plan more than a week or two ahead and for these everything must be bought on credit because saving is impossible and have it now and it must be new are very important values to rac s customers government regulation cannot address either regulation the author s prime solution can curb some of the worst abuses for example gaming commissions can forbid casino operators from locating atms inside the casino payday lenders can be forbidden to roll over loans more than three times credit card lenders can be required to set higher minimum payments to shorten payback time nonetheless market forces and the creativity of lenders and merchants will defeat most well meaning regulation for example native american casinos can evade most state regulation and the high price of credit is easily hidden in the price or rent of consumer goods indeed rent toown was largely invented to evade state usury laws short of a government bureaucracy to establish maximum prices and rents for everything what exactly would he do about this the author describes real problems but his insistence on seeing credit card america primarily as a morality play limits both his vision and his range of possible solutions and remediations 
meh first of all i just need to state that odd thomas is one of my favorite novels ever that said forever odd was a pretty big letdown it lacked much of the intrigue of the first one which is what i was expecting by the end of odd thomas you pretty much know all of odd s secrets and clear portrait is painted i had a feeling that koontz would not be able to do this novel the same way and i was correct what bothered me the most about this book was that it had little to do with odd thomas if you cut out the first few chapters last few chapters and change the names of the characters you would have a book that would not even remotley remind a reader of odd thomas in fact i think that koontz probably should have done just that if he had taken the plot out of the odd thomas universe and developed a stronger relationship between the main character and datura it would have made a good story i also felt that a good third of this book was nothing but space filler with koontz describing odd wandering through complicated water drainage systems and a burned out hotel casinoi thought the last three chapters of the book were amazing but it didn t make up for the less than satisfactory sixty chapters i had to read to get there 
ignore this turkey keegan started out years ago with a bang with the face of battle in which the post vietnam and for the uk a post empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history this early promise has not been fulfilled and keegan has declined considerably in quality because he s become co opted by the establishment a post empire blair establishment every bit as corrupt as haig keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the s that the tempo of the next war which as a sandhurst insider he was probably planning be increased to in this he gave no consideration to the high levels of post traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the us policy of no sleep until baghdad in the second iraq war keegan is post sixties all right but instead of peace and love he s a nietzchean who d wage war with the poor man s body his war is chateau generalship by the rich actually fought by british working class lads blackfellows from britain s few remaining colonies and of course americans keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie subtly and over time dulce et decorum precisely by foregrounding war s utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and once again a test of manhood and this has gotten people killed his book on military intelligence managed idiotically to dismiss mi as secondary and not critical precisely almost to the day when the american and british mi was declaring victory remember mission accomplished and failing to see how disbanding the iraqi army would create the insurgency the iraq war recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it or the iraqis brutalized at key points it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of iraqis to greet their liberators which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science ignore all writings by john keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at sandhurst for a good history of the iraq war cf thomas e ricks the iraq war 
good book for a historian i love camping and eating by the fire and was looking for a good book on dutch oven cooking this book is not it the back cover states woodruff perfected these recipes for more than years as a scoutmaster that period is to the publishing date by today s standards these recipes are dated my son is a scout and i have been on a number of scout camping trips and believe me scouts mostly need simple meals to prepare but woody is too much into canned veggies soups and packaged mixes you have to look long and hard to find a recipe in this book that uses fresh ingredients i suspect that if woody were alive today given his obvious commitment to scouting he would update most of his recipes to reflect more of today s thinking about healthy eating and fresh food 
one of the more preachy books that i have read i enjoyed covey s habits work and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books this is one of the most heavy handed preachy books that i have encoutered give me a break ! after vomiting i threw it out save your money and try these instead leadership challenge irrefutable laws of leadershipgood to greatfirst break all the rules 
bad bad bad who published these weak translations yup they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately how about using real paper b n needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality 
please let it go absolutely pathetic i held out hope right up through the last four pages thinking somehow there would be something there at the end to make up for such a tortuous read here s the deal there is nothing here to care about the writing especially the dialogue characters and story all come in under the column heading trite the comparisons with margaret atwood are unfounded save yourself this is a dud and a wet one at that 
not so much this is the first in the shopaholic series rebecca bloomwood has a very serious problem she can t stop shopping she has crazy money issues and literally just hides her bills in a drawer and goes and shops more to make herself feel better this novel takes place in britain where bex her nickname spends all of her money earned as a financial journalist on the latest designer clothes ps she knows nothing about finance which adds humor as she bumbles her way through the work day in order to attend another press meeting that serves free champagne the irony of her job and compulsion are cute and bex really means well but honestly can t you just cut up the credit card how hard is it to not buy more sweaters i d only recommend this book if you re a big shopper because that s the fun part otherwise it s hard to like rebecca because she comes across as irresponsible endlessly without any willpower and materialistic as they come that said i still must confess that i also read shopaholic ties the knot and shopaholic sister 
a hurried and uninformed look at an important film there is something for everybody in this book because it seems to have been mainly a cut andpaste editing project without any basis of understanding by the author when appearing stuck on a physics issue bruce deferred to an anonymous physics guru who checked the facts and made the determination of good or bad science as a college research project the glossary does provide a nice definition of terms that is useful on the plus side it did prompt me to read the yoga of time travel by respected physicist fred alan wolf now there s a provocative read 
where in hell is my book i odered this book a long time ago from one of the used book dealers 
not a completely sympathetic portrait the author is very articulate and humorous in describing the horrible experience of having a life threatening illness and severe disability she is obviously witty and intelligent however i found her often cruel remarks about other people doctors nurses bystanders to be unnecessary while sometimes her rude and immature remarks were a response to insensitivity at times it was directed towards people who because they were in a professional capacity could not defend themselves for example she chose to make fun of a nurse who wore a hat she thought looked funny and didn t give her the eye contact that she wanted i work in the health professions and occasionally meet patients who are bitter and angry about their situation venting it on others ms garrison reports her snide comments to others to the readers with glee i wondered if the stroke had caused some kind of disinhibition or if she was merely somewhat nasty even before the stroke in any case it detracts from her overall account and reduces the level of sympathy of the reader toward her genuinely unfortunate situation 
soldier poet wannabe this book has a great cover and not much else if the actual combat could be condensed into a smaller book it would be about pages long unfortunately one has to painfully sift through some pretty bad prose or attempted poetry he s like the bonnie parker of the german army his references or image to us wearing a mask were so redundant i could have screamed i d bet he used the mask image no less than times and in a small book that s times too many i only wish it could have been a true combat memoir and not a failed attempt at a hemingway sasoon legacy i truely wish for his sake that something better did book wise come from his experiences 
novel has obvious flaws in plot and structure the murder book is one in a long series featuring alex delaware and only the second i ve read and most likely the last kellerman does a good job characterizing alex and gay friend milo but the plot is so full of contrivances and holes that it made this book very dissapointing the book opens with alex receiving a book with pictures of crime scenes in it dating to years old alex calls milo over to look at it and milo instantly recognizes one of the pictures in there it is of janie ingalls a case he never solved milo then recalls the case and the investigation with his partner schwinn in flashback style milo and schwinn are pulled off the case just as they gather some clues and milo has been bothered by it ever since schwinn has a source who says the ingalls girl may have been at a party thrown by a bunch of rich kids in the present day milo and alex begin investingating the rich kids the cossacks and their friends michael larner and vance coury it seems like for pages they investigate the rich kids befor the dead ingalls girl is mentioned again the link between the murder of the ingalls girl and then the long drawn out investigation of the cossacks and larners and everything that stems from that is tenious at best the book kind of glances over this part at the beginning indicating schwinn had a source who said there was a wild party at a house owned by the cossacks alex and milo believe ingalls and her friend may have attended the party but have no proof or real reason to believe this my problem is that every step that alex and milo take in their investigation is circumstancial not confirmed by any hard facts milo and alex do a lot of investigating but none of their suspicions are ever confirmed by hard evidence the trail of crime from the cossacks is so drawn out its hard to remember at times what the original investigation was also there is never really any contact with the bad guys at all in the book then the book ends with the horrible method of long explanation milo talks with a man who basically explains everything to him about what really happened milo knew some of it through his tedious investigations but the rest is confirmed in the end i haven t read much of this series so i don t know much about the bert harrison character but it seems to be far fetched that a fatherly figure to alex could be the psychiatrist to so many main characters in this book it seems like a cheap plot device to hand alex the answers he is looking for in the end i was very disappointed because kellerman is obviously a good writer i just don t know what he was thinking when he threw this plot together 
same as picture book of the continental soldier if you think this is a new title beware it is a new title on an old text picture book of the continental soldier stackpole books the contents are dated i e the hunting shirt pattern bears no resemblance to the original at newburgh ny washington s hq research shows the cooking gear was more like tin buckets than iron pots the cartridge pouches became standardized during the war enlisted mens tents are not as they are pictured the pickering musket tool was probably never made as none have ever been found etc for the s this book was pretty good but years of research contradicts much of what this book pictures as being typical continental soldier equipment 
fails to look at all angles after thoroughly analyzing this book for a college paper i can say that i am no less than disgusted with the content of this piece it does nothing more than to bash quotwhitesquot as all being racist biggots and horrible human beings all it talks of is the disadvantages of being quotblackquot and the inability of a person of color to come up in this world i wish the author would have analyzed the situation rather than just focusing on putting down quotwhitesquot for the sake of making a point i find the novel utterly disgusting and written in a poor distasteful manner 
don t expect much this book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy save your cash and get it from the library then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman not a child taking orders or information without question if you want to go through pregnancy labor and birth and have no say at all or learn anything useful then stick with this book i e go to the hospital have an epidural episiotomy then finally the c section that must have been necessary this is it beyond that read ina may gaskins henci goer the sears books and childbirth without fear read a broader selection many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore i am a mother of have had healthier more positive birth experiences than anyone i know this book is misleading and negative make it the joyful event you deserve

boooo riiiiing not only boring but poorly organized executed and written and did i mention boring after struggling through a few chapters i tried skimming ahead just to see what was going to happen unfortunately i couldn t even do that because not much actually happens in the first pages and that which does is so convoluted and unclear and written in such awful prose that it is hard to follow additionally although the world is about to come to an end in the story maybe i did not really care about the characters who are more wooden than billy baldwin s acting can i be any more clear this book is terrible as far as the writing goes i ll give you a few choice gems to whet your appetite in case you still want to give this mess a shot some of the outfits attracted her others were positively puritanical in a slinky sort of way hmmm those slinky puritanical outfits can t you just imagine them mens clothing was no less flamboyant or somber looks like men s clothing is also flamboyantly somber wish versace could take a hint from those futuristic flamboyantly somber humans ! many of the spellings had been simplified or paradoxicallymade more complex gosh both simplified and more complex how paradoxical ! guess we ve covered all the bases there ! so if you d like to read a spectacularly bad though paradoxically un good science fiction disaster with unexpectedly trite though inconceivably wooden prose about astoundingly boring though unexpectedly laconic characters i would highly recommend this disturbingly terrible though hopelessly awful book 
non delivery of order i have not recieved this book i have had surgery and forgot about it can you please chec 
i agree with the others i defenitly agree with all of the others some of the stories were good like or the sarah dessen one sarah mylnowksi one sonya sones and megan mccafferty s own also the interview one and maybe one or two others others were complete and utter crap like others said sometimes i didnt even know if the characters were girls or boys and some of them were just plain wierd i recommend borrowing it from the library and reading only the stories you want this isnt a good book to read cover to cover i guess ive lost so respect for megan mccafferty on this one this is defenitely not a good present for a soon to be sixteen year old 
ordinary does not have to be ugly this book depressed me i don t understand what other people see in it i was thrilled when i finished it i don t think anne tyler is my taste 
a simple mind i know a lot of people liked this book but it didn t work for me the main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off acting as if they have committed a huge crime the problem is they didn t there is no crime i talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot and it makes no sense it would make sense if someone comes after the mcguffin early on but no one does not until very late in the book so most of the story has no foundation 
not bad i use the notebook and a walk to remember as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer i was more satisfied with the rescue taylor s friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl etc etc 
too much preaching there really should be a disclaimer on the back of this book the description given doesn t prepare the reader for the incessant preaching what could have been a decent mystery is totally ruined by the insertion of religion in nearly every sentence if ms blackstock wants her books to reach a wider audience then she needs to tone it down a lot if she s satisfied with preaching to the choir then she s done the job well because these books will never be successful out in the real world 
do not recommend this book is full of typos what happened to proofreading is that a lost art jobthis book is also a good example of what andy rooney spoke of authors making thousands on the backs of others nothing is original by the author in this book it is merely a compliation of the works of others you would think at least since the author did have to compose anything she could have at least proofread it 
a scientist s faith in naturalsim run amuk there is no question that this book is the product of an unbounded thinker of possibilities lee smolin s opening description of the history and current state of theoretical physics is highly understandable and makes a more compelling albeit unconscious argument for intelligent design theory rather than his one of cosmic natural selection what is interesting is professor smolin s rejection a priori of any answer lying outside the realm of human observation he then summarily proposes to describe our universe as naturally selected to maximize the quantity of black holes they of course being the wombs of new universes with their own black holes etc i have to ask quotwhy must they create universes why not leprechauns or fairies for both of which we have minimally far more observational testimony quot to quote davies amp brown from their ghost in the atom the many worlds interpretation introduces a preposterous amount of excess metaphysical baggage into our description of the physical world rudolph peierls formerly at oxford dismisses such a theory with a simple question since we have no means of seeing or ever communication with the other universes why invent them it is easily more probable to believe that space time dimensions really do coexist than to buy into a theory composed of an infinite number of ever expanding noncolliding universes created by some unknown mechanism in some unknown space for some unknown reason who says faith is outside the realm of science if a new theory is truly needed now this seems an unlikely candidate 
falling short of its goals ewing s book is about nora simms the successful owner of brickhouse a workout center located in harlem the story revolves around her struggle to keep her workout center despite a local sleaze ball reverend s attempt to boot her revolving stories include her daughter s bulimia her partner s drug abuse her friend s marital problems and oh a romance to be honest there is a lot of potential here ewing s idea is fresh her prose has a nice voice but the book either needed to be about pages longer or take out half of her characters issues ewing just takes too much on and still tries to keep things light it makes her book feel very shallow ewing clearly isn t afraid to be real but she spreads herself so thin she doesn t do any of the topics justice not the substance abuse nonas partner s or her daughter s not the adultery the corruption the struggle of young women against stereotypes it was so frustrating nevertheless i did like ewing s style and it might be worth your time to grab from the library but don t buy it ps pet peeves repeated references to how nona feels connected to harlem has ewing been to harlem i couldn t tell felt that was weak prove it sex scene was totally unnecessary and gross why include it are those women supposed to be nona s friends they re not really admirable women 
eh not so much i am a doctoral candidate and basically this book is not telling me how to write my dissertation and complete it giving minutes a day to the writing let alone the research but really how to overcome blocks and start writing haven t we all been there done that already to me this book didn t offer anything i hadn t already read figured out or been taught perhaps it would be a good book for procrastinators but not for me 
miller s motive for bad reporting this book came out at the same time that judith miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the nytimes that lead the us into the iraq war much of her reporting on wmd spurred interest in her book and increased its sales i wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more wmd fear would increase her book sales 
pleasing but not thrilling the twin stories of this book are entertaining and interesting although not exactly enthralling however it s not very well written peel s descriptions are often rather pedestrian the book is in many places quite repetitive i also don t think john peel has got the hang of the characters they don t speak like themselves although i do think he accuately captured their moods overall it s a decent book which could have been greatly improved by more careful editing as i ve found with many star trek novels 
left behind series the left behind series is the best reading i have ever read i admit my reading is not all that much but when i read the very first book i was hooked i read all twelve books in about six weeks they lead me to understand the bible better thank you tim and jerry for such great books corrine robinson 
corporate co optation of the constitution the problem with the supreme court is the same problem with virtually every u s institution it is being coopted by corporate interests the watershed decision that started this process was the case of santa clara country vs the southern pacific railroad in which corporations were granted personhood since that time the fourteenth amendment among others has been perverted by corporate lawyers to extend additional rights to big business and we the people have been losing the legal structure to control these private tyrannies founding fathers like thomas jefferson warned of this growing menace when he said i hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country and president grover cleveland warned in that as we view the achievements of aggregated capital we discover the existence of trusts combinations and monopolies while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel corporations which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people are fast becoming the people s masters a much more interesting book on constitutional matters is thom hartmann s unequal protection the rise of corporate dominance and the theft of human rights hartmann also hosts a daily radio program that inspires the most thought provoking dialogue in radio i can t say the same for levin s book or his show in fact i think levin is consciously avoiding the more profound issues that people like hartmann raise these more pressing issues are also raised in the award winning documentary the corporation which is available on amazon in dvd format 
like jon stewart but awful book have you ever gotten that embarrassed feeling for someone y know you just want to cringe and make it stop well that s the way i felt about this book jon stewart who is funny on t v is painfully unfunny in print this book was a chore to read i felt so bad for mr stewart because he so clearly embarrasses himself with this book i wish his editor would ve stepped in and protected him from doing this stick to t v mr stewart you re no mark twain yikes 
be warned once upon a time tami hoag wrote romances this is a rather simplistic romance and not one of the mystery suspense novels that she now writes she is better at the latter than the former 
sometimes you can judge a book by its cover i wanted to love this book i looked forward to reading it and i found some value in it however after i finished i found myself staring at the cover photo which is worth the proverbial thousand words a group of students each gazing raptly at the author who is in front of them smiling outward make no mistake this book is about the wonderfulness of rafe esquith to hear esquith tell it there s not much good about public education except his own work he has nothing but contempt for his most of his fellow teachers and he shows it in the nicknames he chooses for them miss mothballs miss busy asabee mr incompetent mr helpless miss egghead miss cruise director esquith is like our great grandparents who walked five miles barefoot in the snow to school and back uphill both ways ! there is no shortage of stories about how much he s sacrficed and how much he gives there are even plenty of tales about how much he s been underappreciated still there are great gaps in his account he tells about the many extra jobs he s taken to provide money for his class projects but it doesn t quite add up to all of the long and expensive trips he takes his students on i suspect that what s missing would make for some interesting reading i took away some important messages don t underestimate students abilities give them a sound context for the challenging literature one assigns them let them know that it s necessary to work hard in order to excel prepare them for field trips so they know how to act what to expect and how to get the most from the experience expect excellence of one s students and of oneself i imagine that esquith is a pretty good teacher you need to read charles osgood s poem pretty good quoted in this book to understand how faint my praise is this book i m afraid irritates more than it inspires 
tedious reminded me of a ut student on the year plan a great page story that is told in pages hope the next is better 
action packed the reason i decided to finish this book is because by time i had read to page i figured i might as well keep going this book is a real drag the pages are a classic ludlum example of quantity not quality this book easily could have been pages less most of it is political talk in which robert tries to keep your attention by adding exclamation points or italics within every sentence after reading the bourne series and matarese circle this was way too long i can t believe other reviewers when they claim this was action packed and a page turning thriller one review said that the rescue in part one was so exciting they couldn t stand it i am still waiting for this book to pick up and take me away with all the action that most reviewers have proclaimed but it s too late for that because i have finished not even enough substance to keep my interest i just wish i had it in me to take a book and stop reading it after i ve gotten of the way thru the reviews that raved about this kendrick guy being the next bourne and that this book could have been exciting books one not even close two sorry but one drag is enough one star because it has some similarities to today s war on terror in america and one star to me for somehow surviving this one stars 
for the coffee table not the kitchen i got this as a gift from my son since i had just visited tuscany last year and loved the food i am an experienced gourmet cook this book needed a test kitchen in the worst way i tried two recipes one for polenta as basic as pasta and a garbanzo bean bread the proportions for both were totally wrong the polenta balled up in the pan and the flat bread was like a soft egg dish i checked in one of my favorite chef cookbooks sheila lukins of silver palate fame and the proportions were very different for the polenta the other recipe couldn t find anywhere i m donating this one to the library for the friends of the library sale 
the origins of totalitarianism this book nicely discloses the ghost of heidegger in much of arendt s writing in short forget your banal bourgeois jobholder worries about material things ! leave issues of redistribution or poverty to the animals ! instead stick your toga on leave the slaves and wives indoors and let s do manly politics ! arendt should have ditched this hyper masculinist romantic grecophilia after it got us to auschwitz go read hobbes or montaigne if you seek a far more humane perspective on life after human carnage in their bourgeois determination to keep romantic mystical yearnings out of the public sphere physically this book just about slips inside arendt s larger monograph on the origins of totalitarianism i fear it is ultimately where it belongs 
you can t judge a book by it s cover or title it just goes to show you can t judge a book by its cover or it s title for that matter this book is just awful awful bukowski wasn t a beat he didn t hang with the beats and he had nothing in common with the beats this book struggles through it s pages attempting to find any connection regardless how tenuous linking buk to the beats it is like saying lawrence welk and the beatles they only thing they have in common is that they lived at the same time and made music buk lived at the same time as the beats and they both wrote there are two separate stories going on here one about the life of bukowski and the other is a history of the beat movement and there is no coherent thought connecting the two the book is heavily referenced and quoted with a complete lack of original thought it is so flimsy that the author had to include a page interview with bukowski and a page notes section just to get the book to a reasonable page length the interview is also terrible after reading it one has to ask is ham on rye the only book by buk that duval ever read the actual discussion of bukowski and the beats is limited to a weak pages the whole thing reads like a bad high school term paper save your time and your money skip this one go watch grass grow it would be more interesting 
half truths and denial of a failed cuban dream towards the middle of castro who had taken personal control of the war wanted to withdraw from angola and discussions began on how this could be accomplished without losing face one of castro s top generals in angola had already tried to defect and moscow was pressing castro to reach a settlement the cuban leader adopted an aggressive stance and threw more cuban troops into the front line in order to lend weight to his negotiating position in the peace talks general del pino who also defected to the west pointed out that it was pure bluff on castro s part and that he feared defeat was imminent cuban forces integrated with swapo units nevertheless pressed on to within kilometres of the namibian border facing cubans and perhaps swapo was a force of battle hardened men from buffalo battalion the only available troops at the border until reinforcements could arrive they held the line until tanks and artillery could be moved up cuban mig s joined the fray and one was shot down as the south african forces prepared to move north to engage the cubans in what promised to be a cuban nemesis the cubans signed the new york peace accords and avoided disaster the cubans immediately claimed victory which bridgland points out was nonsense but that the cuban story was taken at face value by castro s sympathisers in the western press and repeated so many times that it became received truth the cubans were helped by the south africans own clumsy efforts at propaganda which amounted to saying as little as possible about the full scale war they fought in angola the sadf at no stage had wanted an all out war that would take them to luanda as conquerors their objectives had been to fight a limited war in support of unita and prevent the cubans from capturing unita s strongholds the sadf had succeeded in this and was content to let the cubans take the limelight as bridgland points out in his final summary of the war the war for africa and the new york accords provided cuba with pretexts for slipping out of a commitment that had become too hot and too expensive to handle in when the cuban adventure in angola began the scientific socialist and internationalist tide running from moscow looked unstoppable by it was a faded dream despite years of cuban support the angolan economy was ruined the marxist mpla was in utter disarray and was trying desperately to shed its scientificsocialist past castro s dreams of a marxist revolution spreading from angola to encompass the whole of southern africa had become a poor music hall joke the war for africa by fred bridgland the most accurate account of cuba s involvement in the angolan conflict 
lacking in practical advice if you are looking for inspiration or motivation to travel with your child ren or maybe just encouragement that it can be done then this is the book for you if you are looking for practical advice as i was this is definitely not the book for you i flipped through the entire book in minutes turned to my husband and said well that was a waste of 
a basic computer primer light on the garden a third of this book is devoted to basic computer concepts that can be learned elsewhere and better the garden part is a collection of freeware shareware and sample programs many dos based not worth the mone 
not what it appears to be the play into the woods not only contains sinister elements but has an overall dark message to convey it preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine it teaches is that lying stealing cheating and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one s perspective on life also that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you this religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs 
not krentz s best i usually really enjoy jayne ann krentz and her alter ego amanda quick but i actually returned this one to the library unfinished i found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
vs there are star reviews and one star reviews this is more representative than an analysis based only on the last reviews but what is more notable than that is the fact that the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them lone nut theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false posner totally disregards the parkland hospital doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head he would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot that somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts to expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting 
first grade takes a test i bought this book because i read other customers good review comments i have to say dont buy it the book is only introduce you some simple procedures on how to take a test with your common sense you will be able to tell your child all about it plus the price is really a rob i was fooled i hope you won t 
it should be called cower in shame ms howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one it s ok to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one so disappointing especially after her wonderful hilarious to die for the trees for paper that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time 
not what i thought this would be like other reviewers listed here i thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half acentury old if not older using pithy witty humor and comparisons of the writer s life and child s life to be fair there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book but as an avid cook and child fan i wish there had been more i think there is a market today for food writing good food writing like mfk fisher and elizabeth david but i don t think julie powell even comes close the julie julia project is a front for this young novelist who see saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one year period in which she participated to whatever extent in some very profound experiences like working for the government agency dealing with the world trade center memorials a household move in nyc dealing with a less than stellar marraige and coping with very needy friends and family julie get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write ! forget the food it s just not you stick to your hoo hum job your even more narcissistic friends and your boring marraige and you could be the next nora ephron or at the very least erma bombeck 
did they leave the main city ever i read this book on my way to mumbai and when i arrived i thought the plane landed in another country or city the book was great for mumbai proper but once you get out to the suburbs where people actually live the book was useless 
proofreader needed the layout and content of this book is perfect for the individual who basically understands project management but wants to forego a more massive text to pass the it project exam the frustrating thing is there are way too many errors in this guide i found a number of individual questions where the answer key was just plain wrong not to mention that there are a few whole sections where every answer in the answer key is wrong i guess someone changed around the sections but forgot to change the answer key since this is the main point of this concise guide i cannot recommend it 
glimpses of hildegard under a heavy overlay of fox this book claims to be quottext by hildegard of bingen with commentary by mathew fox quot in fact it is nearly all fox with only occasional brief quotes from hildegard confusingly fox uses quotilluminationsquot to mean what hildegard and everyone else calls quotvisionsquot rather than the pictures in manuscripts which are properly called quotilluminationsquot this book contains however twenty five reproductions of these pictures to judge from other reproductions of the same pictures the quality of the reproduction seems mediocre here you can learn only what matherw fox a domican thinks about these visions to find out what hildegard said about them visions which is far fresher and more stunning that what fox has to say one will have to look elsewhere as an introduction to hildegard i would suggest quothildegard of bingen a visionary life quot and quotsecrets of god writings of hildegard of bingen quot both by sabina flanagan 
delusional at best welcome to the seals where author james watson could be expected to lie cheat and steal to get the job done provided that job was drinking ! if this is the first book you read on special forces in vietnam you might think its pretty good you d be so wrong ! i ve read over special forces books and i ve been amazed at how snipers force recon marines rangers and sog teams spent weeks in the harsh jungles gathering intel planting booby traps and snatching prisoners in one case sog soldiers even delivered a baby for a widow of the enemy after destroying its convoy professional soldiers burdened with heavy equipment did all this and more not only while avoiding detection from the vc nva but tigers and leopards too on the other hand shoot firstwatson actually killed a young mother and her newborn baby nursing at her breast why did he do this because he was far too busy lying to superiors cheating to increase his rate rank and stealing from his men to reconnoiter his targets he simply blasted through the thatching of a hut with his shotgun watson s idea of a so called mission in vietnam was going out for hours in levi s blue jeans then getting back to camp before dark so he could get drunk his biggest danger during daylight in vietnam would have been sunburn ! in one story a concerned officer suggested that he stay in to rest while his men continue with a scheduled patrol was james watson actually overworked obviously not his men weren t they went out on patrol as usual watson was admittedly exhausted from drinking every night instead of sleeping so when they came to inform him that his team in the field was under enemy fire guess where watson was found not resting in bed but getting drunk at the club ! watson s tales simply profile how chronic alcoholism increases delusions of grandeur and the self glorification of an undisciplined unprofessional soldier an otherwise proud navy should be embarrassed 
poverty my opinion the key to getting out of poverty is not to get into poverty to begin with examples include having children but not having the financial stability to raise them as well as the irresponsible usage of credit cards which can amount to serious debt getting married divorced taking out a second mortage on your home after you have already paid your home off etc etc etc adam j morainedes moines iowa 
replica of her amanda quick s scandal if you ve read her amanda quick novels this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel scandalheroine proposes to hero who has a hidden agenda of course he s rich and he has almost the same history as scandal whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w the debt and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father s friends business associates want paid right away of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up but his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path the book is so similar that a couple of times i caught myself looking at the cover to make sure i had the right book the only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time 
jane fonda anybody who would name jane fonda as one of the most important women of the century under any catagory except traitor i would not buy or read any book or article that person wrote 
poor evidence of sources maguelonne toussaint samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions there is an obvious french slant on history throughout the book and in some cases there appear to be insertions of quotlocal legends quot or francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than toussaint samats statement ie fabricated quotations attributed to charlemagne s biographer in the cheese story on pages look it up in a generalized broad spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact but that being said the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical at best inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book as an authoritative source into question 
a disappointment as a collector of the entire series no one awaited this book more than i i feel let down of the stories and it s only pages not seven are fiction these were not well chosen selections from treasure island and moby dick are not even set at sea but are the land based openings of the books the non fiction does not live up to the billing of the editorial reviews that preceded it on this page there is not much shipwreck or survivial several are more like philosophical essays as opposed to stories with an edge the story on diving the andrea doria is perhaps the best in the book but many of us will have seen it elsewhere as it is recent why a fictional account of the titanic and not a true one for a book on treasure why nothing of mel fisher and the atocha if you want sea adventure the earlier book in the series rough water delivers a bigger punch this volume regratably is one that you can put down between stories 
hillariously nonsensical plagiarism the worst book ever written about the middle east is probably joan peters from time immemorial in this book alan dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from peters he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so the man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community s leading delinquents and most prolific violators of international human rights law international humanitarian law and un resolutions his defending of nation states however is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable joan peters book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by norman finkelstein and even the most ardent of zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless years after that book faded into oblivion alan dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own for a full documentation of this plagiarism see norman finkelstein s personal website by writing this book dershowitz has inflicted more damage on israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy the case for israel really is both the book and the case that dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies bigoted arguments idiocies misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams 
don t waste your money the other reviewers are right this dog of a book should never have been published in fact it seems to have been published by the author himself by way of a vanity press well he shouldn t have wasted his time or his money and i shouldn t have wasted mine this author knows nothing about philosophy but that doesn t stop him from complaining repeatedly that philosophers are a bunch of idiots if possible he s even more ignorant and prouder of it than rand herself 
self knowledge the only paragraphs worth reading are the once heller got from other books i d suggest you d read those if you want to know about the tsangpo s history otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self knowledge but seems to know what lindgren the expedition leader thinks and feels heller criticizes others but doesn t have the gut to look at his own actions 
super disappointed let me give you a word of advice about some genuine self help you can put to use in your life immediately don t buy this book i had expected or at least hoped for an explanation of where self help breaks down and whether or not it works and what i got instead was a long overly philosophical text that reminded me of my reading for college sociology this book is a case of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin in spades 
atrocious it is a truth universally acknowledged that a married man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a son and heir and that is how pemberley emma tennant s sequel to jane austen s pride and prejudice begins the opening sentence drew me to the novel i liked the throwback of austen s opening sentence of p p and thought it was quite clever that is until i noticed that tennant does this throughout the whole novel i became annoyed with that but that wasn t the worst part of this novel more on that later this sequel centers on family and friends gathering at pemberley for christmas there are the worries centered on mrs bennett and how she and her silly younger daughters would behave during their stay mr darcy and elizabeth also have to worry about lydia and mr wickham and lady catherine de bourgh and there are of course the very predictable conflicts centered on mr darcy and elizabeth s inability to have a child and to make things worse for them mr darcy may be gasp ! the father of an illegitimate child i know this has very likely been brought up in other reviews but i feel i have to vent first of all jane and elizabeth got married on the same day there is a one year time lapse in this installment why is it that jane has a one yearold little girl when in fact this child should have been a newborn if it had been conceived during their honeymoon and is about to give birth to another child all in one year then there is lydia she married wickham a few months before jane and lizzy got married and she has four children of various ages am i missing something here newsflash for ms tennant only animals could have multiple pregnancies in one year then there is the complete destruction of our beloved characters lizzy is an emotional disaster and a pushover here throwing tantrums and crying at everything there isn t the slightest trace of the intelligent spirited and witty lizzy that we all know and love and mr darcy tennant turns him into a pompous brooding jerk he may have been arrogant in p p but we all know that he gains some humility by the end and we also learn that underneath that arrogant exterior lies an honorable gentleman but here we re back to square one and then some and oh ! georgiana hates lizzy she teams up with miss bingley to speak ill of lizzy behind her back and make her life miserable what the hell in pride and prejudice georgiana is a shy proper young woman who likes lizzy the moment she meets her tennant has reduced this character to a villainess in a bad soap opera ick ! mr bingley is once again trashed and turned into a rake of sorts i say once again because this was done to him in another p p sequel i recently read he is the father of an illegitimate child in this one remember the out ofwedlock child that is believed to be mr darcy s i mentioned in my previous paragraph i also hate the fact that the author kills off one of my favorite characters mr bennett why oh why did the author get rid of such a wonderful and hilarious character his bantering with mrs bennett were my favorite parts of pride and prejudice anyway i could go on forever with the inconsistencies and lack of continuity in this novel and believe me there s more ! so i ll move on to anachronisms regency women did not talk about douche among themselves during tea time much less in front of men and even though mrs bennett could be quite vulgar and blunt not even she would give advice on how to conceive a son in the company of men and how would she know about conceiving a son she has five daughters and no sons ! furthermore this novel did not have a feel of regency england at all and all of this dear readers in just pages ! i d hate to think what other errors this author would have concocted had she made this novel longer i could only reach the conclusion that ms tennant has never read pride and prejudice as for using similar quotes from p p well maybe she found them in cliffs notes or something pemberley wouldn t have been so bad if she had intended to rewrite the original novel and not do a continuation of it that still wouldn t explain the multiple births in one year though this novel is just plain bad don t waste your time with it end of venting phew ! i feel better now 
a total disappointment and very depressing i ve always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks and i couldn t wait to read dear john well there was no reason to rush it starts out okay but then just gets more and more depressing the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him instead of just pouting over her for most the book i cannot wait for another nicholas sparks book but only because i want to know that he hasn t lost his touch and that this novel was just a fluck 
snotty and obnoxious bryson is certainly witty but any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author s snotty and obnoxious tone i can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self image what a whining immature mean jerk and by the way there s a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book 
which quotthe silly book quot is this i m looking for one of my favorite books of childhood called quotthe silly book quot i ve read david sullivan s review and the review from a reader from california and i m not sure what to think my quotthe silly book quot featured a character named boodleheimer and including entries like quotboodleheimer boodleheimer rah rah rah ! boodleheimer boodleheimer rah rah rah ! the more you boodle the less you heimer ! the more you heimer the less you boodle ! boodleheimer boodleheimer rah rah rah quot does this ring a bell for anyone is this mr sullivan s quotthe silly book quot the reader from california s quotthe silly book quot or none of the above i d really like to find this book ! if you know where i can find it please e mail my at jmy aolcom thanks 
mixed feelings i would be the first to praise alice walker s skill as a story teller and her prose always entertains me and makes me think that s why i gave this book the stars i gave it i don t mind the out there spirituality i don t buy it but i have no deep gripe against it either what i find depressing and surprisingly childish about this book is the implied contention that if women of color ran the world everything would be good and just the simple truth of humanity is that it is power that corrupts not whiteness or gender if women of color ruled the world instead of white men they would simply become the newest oppressors in my opinion i keep trying to enjoy alice walker s books for more than their style and skillful prose but the message of reverse racism is still there i am white but i am not evil privilegedpatheticracistoppressivesmugwhatever if i were i would not keep trying to read alice walker i wish she would open her mind to that possibility 
phallic narcissism at it s finest gary schwartz writes like a classic phallic narcissist a clinical term used to describe people who elicit his type of behavior isnt it curious how he espouses over and over again being a clinical psychologist when in fact it is a lie anyone who would lie about their credentials would lie about their results in research dont believe the hype 
this book does not live up to its title of quotmaking sense quot walters becomes very wordy in her second chapter and continues throught the entire book this way she has several interesting chapters in which she gives critical interpretations of popular films and television shows however they fail to make up for the dullness of the entire book she is overly critical of previous methods of feminist criticism while at the same time almost cocky about her own superior viewpoint in the end she never actually has a viewpoint of her own except that someone else should pick up the ball and develop a new feminist methodology her wordiness seemed to be nothing more than a cover for a lack of original thought this book is definately not for the new student of feminism or for the skeptic there are many other enlightening books on the subject unfortunately this is not one of them and it would be terrible for the book to turn off any more people to the subject as it did myself 
so so i read all of these things armageddon has it s moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking nicolae and leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil nicolae acts more like a spoiled yr old with the world s arsenal then the antichrist and leon was a buffoon and lacky rather then the false prophet people either love or hate this series i for one do buy into the dogma the series teaches it is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs i hold dear 
for me very disappointing wow ! i m astonished that everyone else liked this so much for me watching ruth yancey fox ruthlessly destroy the lives of everyone in her family was just too depressing i probably wouldn t have even finished this if i hadn t been on vacation i thought ruth should have had her comeuppance a lot earlier in the story and then there would have been a little more joy and happiness instead of grinding misery for the whole damn book i also thought the depiction of the black servants was a bit racist and patronizing the old warmhearted butdimwitted stereotype 
forget it this wasn t any good as a hardback and reissuing itin paperback doesn t change matters to get an idea of what you are in for see the reviewsof the hardback version bottom line don t waste your money 
shallow simple minded and ultimately dangerous this man should have never appeared on oprah he s not an aids activist but a slick businessman making a quick buck by fanning the flames of black homophobia it is unconsciousable to use hiv as a means to sell books and make money i read an issue of the atlanta journal constitution that did an article of jl s luxury home and i wanted to vomit lives both male and female are dying and this loser wants the world to know that he s living large who cares if you buy this book it means you re naive and who can respect you if you re naive 
mel levine is an idiot i found this book to be insulting to children and to educators this man obviously has no idea what he is talking about his ideas are strictly from the deficiency model of student underachievement which has been shown to be a faulty method of explanantion any educator who reads this book and takes it seriously should be relieved of their jobs asap in addition his physical descriptions of his patients are bordering on perverted 
the literary equivalent of candy corn the success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people i was drawn to this book by it s title and central premise too bad ben sherwood can t write worth a lick im not sure which is more upsetting how poorly ben sherwood writes or how low our expectations have fallen as readers given the number of positive reviews this book has received 
disappointing anyone who has read cosmopolitan has read this book ! it is little more descriptive than the popular mag and the photos look very staged which they are 
disappointed i was disappointed like many of the previous readers mostly having to do with non existent character development all clones of each other insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans all of whom seemed to be ruggedly handsome however i was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies for example if one can actually believe that non musicians can air guitar their way through a live performance it doesn t explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone also i find it hard to believe that their gps was working in the depths of the sewers also the cops plan to pour dye into the sewers didn t seem like it should have worried the corporation with a couple of hours head start wouldn t their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye also the cia head was years old in and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in wwii pretty responsible job for someone who was years old at the end of the war 
not really what i wanted i was kind of disappointed in this book the format was really neat but i thought i would really love it and it was just okay there weren t any recipes that sounded good to me or contained nuts to which i am allergic i returned this book it just wasn t for me 
not really worth it i didn t like this book i thought it was a waste of time and money 
a finance textbook full of errors and holes i am a postgraduate student in finance and this book is on my reading list for corporate finance i must say that i am not very pleased with this book first it seems to skip around from chapter to chapter with no real logical organizational structure second it is full of typos and mistakes some that are quite dangerous for a proper understanding of the material third it does not develop fully the statistically techniques in chapter that it builds on in later chapters this is a major problem in my opinion what saves this book from the lowest rating is that it does discuss empirical studies and journal articles and it does not do an entirely awful job about the more qualitative subjects like adverse selection and capitalization policy for what it s worth i received my undergraduate degree at wharton and am now at the london school of economics instead of this book i recommend brealey and myer s principles of corporate finance this is what i used as an undergraduate and is what seems to be the de facto textbook in the top undergraduate and mba programs n 
wrong content for young children first i hardly ever write reviews but after this story i needed to state something second i am not considered a conservative and relatively open minded third i always appreciate history and culture and understand this story was handed down through generations however never reading this story myself and reading it to my three and a half year old for the first time i had to stop half way through the book after realizing the heart of the story surrounds a monkey killing a baby owl and the jungle searches for the killer while the mother owl grieves to complement the story there is an illustration of the monkey snarl showing sharp teeth hitting the baby owl over the head with a branch not a bedtime story for this family it was given as a gift and will be returned shortly 
just not up to ms hooper s normal standards i ve been like many reviewers a long time fan of this author and have found this latest evil novel to be less then inspiring or fun to read it does read like a textbook as far as the topic of psychic issues our teaching was couched in conversation normally between rafe and isabel we would hit these class lectures normally right in the middle of the murder mystery portion of the book and i would just be getting into the meat of the story and then i would be derailed by too much information this is not to say that i don t care for instuction and added background i do but there is a time when it is just too much we unfortunatly hit this wall of information throughout the story this was just an okay read there was plenty of suspense who was doing all of the killing and why but i just felt that the fleshing out of the storyline as well as character development was not truly priorty while writing the novel the relationship between rafe and isabel was rather confusing she spent most of her time lecturing him on paranormal issues and less time letting her hair down and being relaxed while she was with him socially to be honest i did skim a few pages but still i was okay as far as not missing anything important this was not her strongest effort and if you are picking ms hooper up for the first time i highly recommend her other earlier reads or even the other two evil reads an author can t be on top all of the time and we should just remember that she is capable of doing so much better i m really looking forward to her latest series she has started that will still feature bishop and his team and hope that she is back on track as the author we love official reviewer www romancedesignsco 
stuffy predictable and annoying i borrowed this book a while ago hoping for an enjoyable light read unfortunately not the main character of this series amelia peabody is supposedly interesting unfortunately not obsessed that men are the evil of every age her rants occupy almost every page her supposed insights and commentary were so long that i found myself speed reading through the pages scanning as many as pages every few minutes the sidekick is just as annoying while she isn t complaining about the weather she is busy fainting anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the mummy was what little intrigue there was was ruined by the predictability although the writing was quite enjoyable it was ruined by many of the characters i d take one of the case studies of sherlock holmes over this any day or any book by pd james or jd robb 
buy something else i ve been doing the e e books in preparation for law school and they ve all been accessible and comprehensible this one however is the exception maybe it s the ethereal nature of the subject but this book is killing me i feel like i am wasting my time reading it since i can t seem to make out the forest nor the trees through the fog if you re just starting out i can t recommend this book for preparation maybe in the future it will make more sense but for this beginner it s very confusing 
let s reinforce gender differences from the start it s great that little girls who are being potty trained are learning that they have a pee pee and all but what the heck is a pee pee anyway i always thought that pee pee comes out of a wee wee and not the other way around i was originally intrigued that there were both boy and girl books is their anatomy so different that they need different books apparently not as the once upon a potty girl book also says that girls have pee pee sso i guess the only difference is the color of the flowers not sure why you need separate books it s nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too blue for boys pink and purple for girls maybe the chamber pot style toilets in the book actually exist in a spanish speaking country somewhere maybe 
now this is just too boring kriss stephens knows one thing for sure ghosts whatever they are or however you choose to define them exist and she really knows how to find them and take their pictures she refers to herself as a paranormal investigator and a professional photographer and fear is the story about some of the hundreds of ghost hunts she s done over the years there is in stephen s world no such thing as a world without ghosts and there s no point trying to prove their existence because well they exist she s very sure about that what s worth investigating though is how and why a certain location becomes haunted and yes i agree those are definitely questions worth asking but just make sure not to do it they way kriss stephens does it because i don t think i ve ever seen a so called paranormal book of such low quality there s no reason doubting that stephens believes in what she does she s both honest and motivated but honestly if she s really a paranormal investigator and especially a professional photographer then my parents dog could be that too the book is absolutely packed with black and white pictures and they re all just as boring pointless uninteresting and stupid in each new chapter stephens alone or together with a group of colleagues goes to a haunted location and wherever she goes she has some sort of ghost related paranormal experience as soon as she arrives at a new site be that a house with a violent history a battlefield from the american civil war a cemetery and so on she starts taking picture with her digital camera and she always ends up with photographic proofs of the presence of ghosts well then what are those proofs of hers orbs orbs and more orbs in other words perfectly natural phenomena that has nothing whatsoever to do with the world of the paranormal and in case it s not orbs then it s fuzzy details or smoke or something else very much mundane that in stephens eyes turn into ghosts and that s how the story goes throughout all of the book s pages more or less every single page has at least one picture and most of the pictures don t even show anything interesting at all the book is not one bit investigative there s no critical thinking to be found and i doubt that i ve ever read a book where the author has been as gullible as kriss stephens yet i still had a good time reading it because gullibility can be extremely entertaining still i cannot help but to feel sorry for stephens who apparently lives in her own little fantasy world where ghosts almost seem to outnumber real life humans 
starts off ok but really pushes the boundaries of common sense in many ways yungen s book is good it rasies serious questions about the influence of eastern thought and metaphysics in modern christianity and some of his points are quite valid however the conclusions that he draws regarding cnetering prayer eventually become very tenuous and downright tangential to be blunt his reasoning goes like this a eastern mystics chant mantras omb contemplative prayer sometimes involves repeating a word or phrase jesusc a b therefore contemplative prayer is un christiananother form of his reasoning a eastern religion influenced the desert fathersb the desert fathers influenced thomas mertonc thomas merton influenced richard fosterd richard foster influenced rick warrene therefore rick warren believes in eastern religionplease read this book critically if you read it at all 
don t read it if you re black or gay or female it s fragmented and feels like it doesn t know whether it wants to be funny or serious but i could have lived with that if it hadn t been so scarily oblivious and unpleasant one example and i m secretly thrilled that i might actually be starting a friendship with someone as cool and as black as angie oh great because black people just love that i mean how cool is that rich white lady wants to be my friend because i m black ! groovy ! i love to be an accessory ! she doesn t have to feel like she s a self centered useless rich boob anymore because she s different ! she has a black friend ! and a gay one ! how rebellious and don t get me started on how she fancies herself some wild andcrazy partier but still thinks oral sex is taboo and antifeminist and that any guy who wants to do a woman up the butt is necessarily gay who is this book for not for black people gay people non rich people or any woman who has ever enjoyed any kind of sex beyond the standard missionary type in other words it s for dr laura and that s about it 
health text a book of words and dubious references by quotexpertsquot i cannot find any important educational references in this book as an expert in the field of natural medicine this is one book i would never use 
too old fashioned this book had some good ideas if it were it s very outdated i m sure it was a good book when it was still current but in it s just a a waste of time and money 
good but lacking an incomplete edition while this story is truly an essential writing of dostoevsky it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy if you are interested in reading the grand inquisitor without reading the rest of the brothers karamazov i would recommend the guignon edition sold for only a little more this work includes the two chapters preceeding the grand inquisitor as well as what dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale the russian monk which follows this legend dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole but i think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy additionally this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by charles guignon which is much more informative than the brief one by anne fremantle provided in this copy it is important to remember that the grand inquistor was not dostoevsky s final answer in the brothers karamazov reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both dostoevsky s writing and philosophy and the brothers karamazov i would recommend reading the book as a whole instead and i particularly recommend the pevear and volokhonsky translation for that it is much more accurate to the original russian or at a minimum reading the other edition of this book either way you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of dostoevsky which this fails to provide the grand inquisitor is truly an essential read but not in this presentation of it 
disappointing this was not the life changing book it was touted to be i have no major complaints but the book was not helpful 
disappointing instalment of jack ryan i d loved all the other jack ryan stories i d read though i hadn t read all of them this was a little too coarse and nowhere near as good as the earlier ones 
read this first http wwwquackwatchorgindperriconehtmlan excerpt dr perricone would be more credible if he could show us a study demonstrating that people who followed his prescription lived longer had younger skin demonstrated by objective measures or felt better compared to those on a placebo program or that they were better in any measurable way instead he provides only testimonials exaggerated claims partial truths and incorrect statements he cherry picks possibly supportive studies from the literature and ignores contradictory studies he cites lots of lab studies in vitro or in animals but few that demonstrate any clinical effects in humans the diet he recommends is low in calories and weight loss alone may improve the way his patients look and feel his advice about tobacco and sunscreens is appropriate but there is little science behind the rest of his program he seems to have gathered every nutrient and skin cream he had any reason to hypothesize might work and advised using all of them and sells them for an exorbitant amount of money to the exclusion of anyone else s a more rational approach would have been to first see which ones really worked and later to see if any combinations of the effective agents worked better than a single agent 
doesn t compare this book does not compare with atlas shrugged or the fountainhead in my opinion those are two of the finest books ever written if you haven t read them put we the living aside and read them now i could not finish we the living i got sick of the stupid relationship i guess i got about th the way through maybe my tastes are changing 
souls of black folk was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free 
book of reprints be forwarned this book merely reprint articles from past and some may say ancient issues of model railroader magazine an expert model railroader could probably create some of them however for a novice this provides little more than ideas for layouts also many of the plans are for ho and n scale with very few o scale layouts overall i d say there are better layout books out there for you to spend your money on 
i feel cheated i was anticipating a wonderful diary of an amazing journey by an englishwoman of privilege over the western plains of the american west what i got was a narrative history of the mormon religion and its ups and downs having read many diaries of pioneer women this one attracted me because jean rio started out in england with a small fortune at her disposal i was disappointed that so much of the book was wasted on brigham young and so little of it on jean 
a book of cliches and fluff if you are interested in the entrepreneurial world you might find this book an entertaining read however if you are an entrepreneur or want to be one this book is most likely not going to help you i have read so many business books including books on start ups and invariably with the exception of a couple of books those for start ups are of low value and do not provide sufficient information desperately needed by entrepreneurs with so many fluff books on start up companies and entrepreneurs there is a great need for more in depth how to books this one certainly has not bucked the trend it seems that so many of the reviewers are just so proud and honored to speak of mr kawasaki s previous stent with apple or his garage com firm which i still do not think he is sure what their mission is that they have not given the book a truly subjective and unbiased review when reviewing a book for entrepreneurs you should ask yourself the foillowing question does the book really show you how to be successful is the information so valuable that you will study it and take notes or refer back to it for future use there are very few sources of valuable education for entrepreneurs anywhere therefore it is important that the authors of these books provide what is left out in business schools traditional business topics are covered well in business schools so there is more room for business fluff books despite this fact there are still many books on traditional business topics in contrast for entrepreneurs the only source of education is the book market so you should stay away from fluff books or motivational type books all of which teach you nothing 
pseudo christian claptrap i will never ever recommend this author she may claim to be a christian but her behavior is anything but this person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals as it is clear she has no understanding of them she describes them as something that formed wrong flowers that didn t open i have news for you ms johnson god doesn t make mistakes each person is made that way for a reason just because you can t get out of a stone age interpretation of the bible don t infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian love i want to go wash my hands in lysol it is because of attitudes like hers that christians like me are portrayed as a bunch of whacko nutjobs 
poorly written self help garbage snakes on a plane the book if you ve just read dawkins books such as the selfish gene or the blind watchmaker and think this might be a good follow up please think twice this is not a science book and reads much more like a self help book there is a very low content noise ratio as it delivers very few ideas and then expounds upon the same ideas over and over again using every new metaphor or anecdote the author can imagine i couldn t even finish it as i was bored to tears and eventually just felt completely patronized and then annoyed by the author s sloppy understanding of the science involved he repeatedly refers to natural selection as a kludge which shows a complete lack of understanding of dawkins material if you want a good laugh at brodie s incompetence with even basic statistics use amazon s inside this book feature to read the paragraph on page that begins now let s get a handle on what it really means you can also search on the number to find this page either the author is clueless or the people on this island have year lifespans how did this guy get published 
not worth more than usd this book gives some basic information but of the text refers to the pmbok which you also have to buy to read it it gives a few tips like you may have problems with your scope because there is a multiple ownership all in all there are about pages of information so in my opinion it is worth about usd if you are a public project manager it brings you no insite into how to do your job better 
more than a disappointment i wanted to cry when i put this book down because i miss the danielle steele that wrote thurston house family circle and others for years now i have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers i really feel like her heart just isn t in it anymore she has become very idiosyncratic and predictable every book has her main character being honest i keep reading because i am a loyal danielle steele fan and i write this in hopes she ll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it like she once did or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works this book was just awful 
very overrated lincoln biography i generally enjoy reading biographies but this one was an exception ! a very boring read ! i did not think that lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did but i seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations i was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of lincoln s life i feel that there was too much concentration on lincoln the politician his political development and not enough about his family and social life i wanted to know lincoln better on a personal level and i did not feel that this book provided much insight i may have been expecting too much but i prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep as this one frequently did 
meandering and plotless i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me nothing ever happens there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
if you want to win in vegas don t buy this book i started playing craps this past year and really enjoy playing the game naturally i wanted to develop my skills and use my new fascination to make a little money opposed to placing wild bets that seldomly paid out i purchased this book to attempt to beat the system with mathematical odds while this book does touch on the mathetical odds of the game the strategy recommended by the author appears to be based on superstition rather than mathematics as such i believe the supersystem to be inherently flawed i would not recommend employing this system in the casino if you want to make money good luck and happy gambling 
absolute boredom this unfortunate book suffers from an acute case of aphoristic intoxication evidenced in such pithy morsels as like most cynics he was profoundly sentimetal about sex and our marriage was the meeting of zero and zero although such modestly entertaining observations kept me plodding along the book is a lame attempt at armchair beat philosophizing ensnarled in a wholly unengaging plot and unbelievably boring characters i first read about this greatest of books in joe ezterhas s biography and it makes sense that he would consider its shallow machisimo the stuff of masterpieces avoid this reread day of the locust recommended for only the most die hard of hollywood historians or cultural completists 
hopefully this series will improve unlike cussler s other series i found this first story of the oregon files slow going at first and rather confusing there are just too many things going on no problem i suppose for multi taskers and way too many characters to keep track of also there s little to no character development even of mr chairman juan cabrillo the fact that he and his companions are mercenaries with a penchant for good deeds that pay well doesn t compare favorably with the numa heroes however the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides i expect from mr cussler and co writers i look forward to the subsequent oregon files with high hopes 
what exactly is of the essence here quoteverything is an echo quot ilan stavans wrote in the essay lost in translation quotto live is to plagiarize to imitate to steal quot and so he does the editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of well known authors under the common title the essential is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry whose work can be somehow distilled but ilan stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no essential stavans only the echo i always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal stavans has been against latina writers such as ana castillo and sandra cisneros see form over content p stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by chicana writers to create their own respective worlds the reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book stavans heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him octavio paz walter benjamin elias canetti lionel trilling writers stavans has invoked to explore his own identity as a latino jewish male by his own admission stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity rather than in the assertion of a self created identity this is why he writes so brutally against chicana writers because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it the short stories in this book particularly show stavans at his most derivative imitating kafka while alluding to him 
boring i was able to finish this book unlike gilead but this author is soooo boring ! will not read another by her no matter what the reviews 
a lot of pages with little to say in all i think this story could have been written in about ten pages in the new yorker or some publication like that mr sierra simply took too long to get to his point and rambled about topics not relevant to the crux of his book because it was originally published in spanish part of me wonders how much was lost in the translation then again that would only account for a better read not a better plot 
never got the book i waited for weeks and never got the book i tried to contact the vendor different times with no response i purchased the book somewhere else and i got it the next day i am still waiting for my money to be returned 
creed of iron needs sources and better artwork do not get me wrong the book is an interesting read and should at least help wake the millions of slumbering folk by at least making people think about something other than coffee suv s and work it is even a pleasurable read but come on no sources it would be nice to know where the author got some of his claims and facts if not only for the purpose of chasing down further reading with no sources the entire book is weakened and really is just the opinions of words press therefore it comes off as a little too much like a sermon rather than serious philosophical thought a further problem is the simplistic childish artwork i felt like i was reading a childrens book at times one would do much better to read something historical or by thorsson 
much better cookie books out there i picked this book up at a store and ended up returning it some cute ideas but was disappointed by the many recipes that started with cake mixes tried the witches broomstick cookie cute but not a great tasting cookie if you really like to bake cookies there are much better books out there 
mainstream this book was a disapointment for me i am going to vacation on the northern california coast this fall and was hoping to learn something from this book but it is mostly just the well worn mainstream information that doesn t need retelling it completely omits the area i ll be and the areas it does cover are handled more effectivly in other books the pictures are great though 
same old robicheaux despite the beautiful poetic descriptions of nature which are peppered throughout his books james lee burke falls short as a mystery writer an author shouldn t concentrate more on describing the environment than developing the plot which is exactly what he does and after you ve read a number of his novels about the jaded ex cop dave robicheaux you start to realize that they all follow a very strict formulaic pattern so formulaic that i think i can summarize the generic plot of every one of burke s novels they all go pretty much as follows first dave robicheaux unwittingly becomes involved in some sordid affairs so he decides to start poking his nose around he is threatened by criminals to stay out of their affairs but instead of complying he beats them up and continues investigating despite the warnings he is utterly shocked when the villains retaliate by harming someone close to him the case having become more personal robicheaux begins running from place to place making obtuse accusations and threats to various people until he earns the animosity of almost every character in the book he eventually stumbles upon the solution to the mystery and he never manages to punish those responsible because his hands are tied legally ultimately it turns out that things would have worked out better for everyone had he simply not stuck his nose where it didn t belong and there is nothing quite as disappointing as finishing a book and finding out that nothing worthwhile was accomplished by the protagonist aside from this robicheaux becomes tiresome quickly though he is a decent enough guy it is very difficult to have sympathy for a man who brings all his troubles on himself with his stupidity and unwillingness to stop poking his nose into other people s affairs if you feel that you absolutely have to read one of these books my advice is to pick one at random read it and then don t read any of the others believe me they are all the same 
hollywood movie no wonder this book has not been translated into spanish it would be an absolute fiasco the story of spain was so obviously designed to be a good seller among american tourists that it would make an excellent hollywood movie such is the distortion of history the author did very little research or none at all and never submitted the manuscript to the scrutiny of a spaniard scholar to prove what i am saying i need only to state that he committed the two most capital of the sins first to be wrong about spain s saint patron and second to mix up the most precious symbol of hispanidad in page you can read popular legend says that saint james the elder santiago believed to be half brother of jesus brought christianity to the peninsula around ad some confusion has arisen over the identity of james the lord s brother who was not one of the original twelve apostles and st james son of alpheus also known as james the less neither of them is spain s patron saint in about ad king herod agrippa i beheaded the apostle st james james the great son of zebedee and st john s the evangelist s brother this is the one we venerate every spanish man every spanish woman knows the difference ask them as for the symbol of hispanidad there is one virgin of guadalupe whose statue lays in a monastery near caceres spain there is another virgin of guadalupe with no relation whatsoever to the first one whose picture was according to tradition miraculously imprinted on an indian s cape that of san juan diego this picture not a statue can be seen at a basilica in mexico city the latter was declared queen of the americas by the catholic church most latin americans don t even know that the first one exists let alone that she is the symbol of hispanidad 
not worth the effort i saw this book when i was a child and wanted to read it then it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp airship on it unfortunatley life intervened and i only got around to reading it just recently alas this book was a lot better and more wonder filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be the story is not very interesting the setting is not well painted the protagonist s adventures are pedestrian and the whole thing is swiss cheesed with so much british slang as will likely put an american kid off his feed skip this one 
you re kidding i read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for mothers day it was the only btb book i ve read since woman of substance and i fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer ! the dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a victorian novel the heroine calls her brother brother mine oh brother ! i finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
poorly written and poorly understood twaddle i have nothing but respect for someone who learns enough art and enough physics to write a proper book on the topic unfortunately this author has not done so put simply this text contain information that is downright misleading physics can be quite difficult especially if one is trying to understand the esoteric worlds of relativity and modern quantum physics that said there is no excuse for misleading a reader when an educated layman s understanding of physics would reveal correct and useful information dr shlain states several things that would mislead a lay reader for example his understanding of the way lights add is just plain wrong this might not harm a painter but would harm a digital artist or someone building light sculptures were said painter to think that their flawed understanding was supported by relativity they would resist learning how lights differ from pigments making it very hard to move to interior design or other light based domains this complete failure to get the physics even close to correct makes me worry about the art history again he does not have to be an expert but proper due diligence would suggest sending the drafts to a working art historian and a working physicist to get their feedback before inficting it on the general public again i am not claiming that one needs graduate level work to write such a book i do claim that one should have at least an educated layman s exposure to the feilds before taking pen in hand 
to much detail temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist the author is a anthropologist in real life and i feel she gave to much detail as to body parts conditions locations in the book and in about the rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about gabby including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of gabbys place how gabby and tempe were friends from grad to man parts in life book was not for me i dropped it at the rd chapter 
beautiful beginning painful illogical ending i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction if thoughts are that powerful they need to be resrained earlier i don t know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive logic can be quite painful when left alone but sometimes it has to be 
anti minimalist for someone who claims to be writing a book which supports historicity of the bible and an anti minimalist stance dever s work is a disappointment according to dever the historicity of the bible is basically limited to the period of kings he thinks that no researcher takes the early israelite history such as the exodus seriously a point of view which is definately not true 
needs a parental rating this was assigned for entering th graders as summer reading the story of a dysfunctional family alcoholism child abuse is maudlin enough on it s own the author apparently thinks that teenagers need to be exposed to graphic sex and x rated language to relate to the dilemmas of growing up i found the story tedious the language unimaginative and the message simplistic skip this one 
his other books are better once upon a time is a lament of the loss of the old ways while it does have sloane s trademark illustrations and observations it constantly compares the old to the inferior modern ways written in not all the complaints still apply and they detract from his usual loving description of early america i grew up with a reverance for wood and a museum of early american tools which i always loved this book is not up to the standard that sloane set with his earlier work 
yuck man oh man i think this is one of the worst books i ve ever read if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars i would seriously half way through i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive i found the book bizarre unfocused and poorly written the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation the physics engineering psychology medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome only to have them dissipate and so on the characters don t even seem like real people for example the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles and only her ankles flashing below a curtain and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are how could someone know a person that well but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood or one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive as though he really thinks this will attract them c mon if the guys a nut and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking duck to them is nuts ! write him as a nut the whole way through don t make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book s climax the book s title isn t even explained for crying out loud thanatos means death in greek i believe but i could never understand what the author editorsaudience thought was dying i won t read this one again nor will i look for anything else by percy walker 
read the back carefully in a rush i read the great reviews on the back of the book and thus decided to start reading this book but i soon realized the great reviews are not justified by this book i took another look at the back and saw that the reviews are ment for the author s the bookseller of kabul if i had not been misled she might have gotten another star from me 
the templar papers this is the rd book i have read on the templars the text is a hodge podge of interesting facts and spectulations on the knights templar the disorganization and disjointed style makes the information difficult to follow there is entirely too much repetition and too many rhetorical questions in every chapter there is virtually no chronologic order to the material it would have been very helpful to the reader if the author provided a simple map to indicate the location of the many places temples churches etc mentioned in the text it was difficult to know without searching other references if the location of the place incident battle or refuge referred to was in the middle east holy lands france scotland or england in chapter one of the contributing authors defoegives a history of the canadian masonic templars and later in the same chapter r lomas presents a brief history of freemasonary this was a bit perplexing and again this underscores the disorganization of the text material finally given the problems that quickly become obvious to the reader the editor must take some blame or responsibility for the poorly organized material of the text 
can you predict what i am going to say about this book i love to people watch i adore the human body and appreciate all the different forms and characters it comes in i bought the book because of it s promise to help show me how to understand people and predict their behavior i work with parents of young children this ranges from beauty to the beast in character kingdom parents come to me for help and i know that every person has a story behind him her that presents itself as raw and unfriendly behavior at times i wanted to learn to be more empathetic to them everything i learned about people i learned on the job just by being attentive to people you probably know more than you think about reading people for example a tanned face may reveal that the person s job or hobbies put him outdoors for considerable periods and people whose skin is very pale generally have few outdoor hobbies see you probably can predict people already ! but if you want to see it put into lots and lots of words then this book will do that it could be fun to use the formulas to your advantage you can derail the people reader into thinking that you re happy just by humming ! 
a highly agrivating pile of schlock frustrated authors take note you can be published and you don t even have to worry about little details such as punctuation sentence clarity story structure or grammar cormac mccarthy proves it eloquently with all the pretty horses had mccarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher who was either drunk or high or both who thought what the hell let s print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it i m sure people will buy it after all americans don t care about grammar anyway im not going to dive into the plot of the story you can read it above this book falls short of one of the best in literature how they compare this guy to faulkner is beyond me the comparrison is an insult to faulkner and people who read books in general most fifth graders can write better more enthralling naratives 
you can fool some of the people all of the time have you ever read a study that contains tiny bits of truth usually things that are obvious but the rest is false that s the case with generations at work if you remove the stereotypes all that remains is stuff that ought to be obvious it may be that some ceos with large numbers of disgruntled employees are unaware of even the most blantant trends and conflicts in the workplace but the lesson there is to fix the workplace not the employees all generations will be cynical if they are contstantly in danger of being laid off from my own experience examples that are completely the opposite of what this book describes people in my age group are supposed to be driven overachievers how i wish that were true must have come from astrology or something i worked for a company that hired two young golden collar tech experts these kids were outstanding there were no personality conflicts there were no generational conflicts and the fact that they were so knowlegable made us worship them ! so what if they preferred rock climbing to golf speaking of stereotypes the company shut down and we all got laid off according to this book young it professionals can write their own ticket right false again four months have passed and one of our young geniuses has a boring job with a long commute and big pay cut the other has refused to take a crummy job and remains unemployed the book is not without humor perhaps unintentional apparently lucent is a good example of how waring generations can make peace but i wonder how many managers want their company to perform as lucent has in the end the key to a productive harmonious workplace is for people to have jobs they enjoy pay well and are reasonably secure in a lesser work environment all managers can hope for is to tap into the stereotypes in this book to try to keep the dust down 
belief vs belief not science vs religion this book is written relatively well but as other reviewers points out if you really want to understand the arguments then you had better realize eugenie scott is a staunch defender evolution and always has been in other words there is no way she could have and did not write a balanced treatment of the debate at all it s balanced for evolutionists to be sure not for anyone else and obviously not for me i am still waiting for anyone anyone at all to go into enough detail about the fossil record there are a number of possibilities here to actually prove that there are enough fossils that the dating of them was accurate there was no fudging and many more details about the fossils themselves and the techniques used to analyze them to show that evolution is a fact if for example we somehow fossilized different birds that are alive today some related and some not i have a feeling that evolution would still be prescribed as the cause for the different species that different dates would be assigned for each species based on what type of rock it was found even though it has nothing to do with anything in this case etc the negative reviews of those who critize this book are based purely on emotion none of them involve science which is supposedly what evolution is based on if anyone can tell me how specific traits of evolution are testable such as the fact that life began from inanimate matter or that species evolved into separate species i would love to hear it please be specific and let me know how you know based on your five senses and not that there s a magical theory that explains it because just as creationism explains everything so does evolution both are not true i am truly amazed that amazon com doesn t delete most of the reviews because they are nothing but a bunch of cheap shots at the other side 
don t waste your time it was all i could do to finish this book the subject matter interested me because i knew someone who committed suicide so i was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter there was some funny dialog but i was disappointed in this book overall the characters were unlikeable an abnoxious teenager a wimpy middle aged woman etc not only were the characters totally annoying they didn t like each other yet they kept hanging out together yeah i get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do but the author didn t convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up going on vacation together etc there were also some rediculous threads in there like lying about the angel on top of the building that was when the book started to lose me i made it through to the end but it was a great effort and i just skimmed the last pages or so 
i expected something workable my expectation from the big book of sales games was to find an informative book that can provide creative ideas for making training more enjoyable however the content was very ordinary and nothing creative especially ideas on objections was not applicable 
great material flawed by credibililty questions a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball quotnutsquot who grew up in new york we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny quotwonder five quot who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled this book is a fictional addendum to rosen s non fiction treatment of the original basketball quotscandalsquot as he outlines in his npr interview unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors broadway and rd street cannot be on the east side of manhattan madison square garden has been on rd street and is now above penn station in between it occupied the block bounded by th and th streets and eighth and ninth avenues these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college and they undermine the author s credibility and care in writing since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence the game of who is this really is inescapable hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers and quota couple are in the hall of fame quot this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy holy cross dick mcguire st johns bobby wanzer seton hall and frank mcguire the legendary coach at st john s north carolina and south carolina 
pin the tale on brigham smoke and mirrors to slander brigham young so lets see if this makes sense mormons are forcibly expelled by missouri militia gov boggs infamous extermination order in they are again expelled by illinois militia in after joseph smith is murdered in state custody they flee to the desert wastes of the great basin where no one else wants to settle they struggle against starvation to survive republican john c fremont notable for killing indian women children with his sabre to save gunpowder runs for president in on a platform to abolish the twin relics of barbarism namely slavery and polygamy southern democrat james buchanan is elected president in he won t do anything about slavery but buchanan pre empts the republican s religious bigotry platform by acting on bogus reports of a mormon rebellion to send the utah expedition to quell the insurrection utah territorial governor brigham young fearing with just cause the worst orders what turns out to be a bloodless defense by mormon raiders who force johnston s army to winter in ft bridger wyoming this delay permits cooler heads in washington salt lake city to avoid open war in this in the context that newspapers in california and elsewhere had long advocated a final solution to the mormon problem better to kill them than to tolerate them since the mormons had been driven from state to state because of religious intolerance why would they have reason to trust the good graces of pres buchanan and a beligerent hostile federal army marching on utah author will bagley briefly mentions most of the above historical facts and acknowledges that gov young had virtually no military or political weapons to resist federal authority but his entire book is spent minimalizing the ordeals of the mormons even insinuating they deserved to be driven in order to slander gov young with a supposed crime of power in a nutshell bagley picks up the prosecutor s mantle of cradlebaugh carlton and baskin in their rigorous but dead end attempts to pin the tale on brigham those bigots couldn t produce evidence to indict brigham young then despite the full power and funding of the u s government army behind them and bagley certainly fails to produce evidence to indict brigham young now for example bagley s smoking gun the journal of dimick huntington speaks vaguely of gov young s giving the cattle of emigrants on the road south to the piutes but fails to mention that none of the indians present at that event were anywhere near mountain meadows until after the atrocity was consumated the piutes who did participate knew nothing of this purported deal you d expect such sham evidence from the likes of barney fife not a serious or unbiased historian further bagley presumes to channel gov young s thoughts regarding the mormon s september war strategy against the hostile u s government army bagley speculates that gov young ordered the massacre of the fancher train to in some way intimidate the u s government by closing the overland trails and violating his oath of office this is utterly preposterous especially in the context of a hostile army marching on utah obviously bagley believes gov young to be either exceptionally stupid obtuse or perhaps jim jones suicidal to deliberately give pres buchanan and the army the very pretext incident they needed to justify the elimination of the mormon problem once and for all bagley acknowledges that gov young was a foxa very shrewd operator another bagley contradiction if bagley is so biased to believe such tortured logic perhaps he also can conjure the tunnel vision necessary to believe in the tooth fairy bagleys research for the most part is detailed if not tedious though he should better acknowledge the tabloid nature of most of his sources he often quotes tabloid rather than primary sources his prose is pointedly inflamatory against brigham young and the mormons they are fanatics who are oblivious to the rancor the practice of their religion has on non mormonsas if this is license justification to send mobs militiasarmies to persecute prosecute and drive an entire religious movement hasn t bagley heard of the first amendment pres buchanan sure acted like he didn t bagley s conclusions and analysis are preposterous particularly the tortured parsing of gov young s straight forward order to haight iron county to leave the wagon train alone depends on what the meaning of is is right mr bagley bagleys caricature of mormon society as not being capable of doing anything with or without direction from brigham young is also groteque insulting and utterly false i defy anyone anywhere to show where in the book of mormon the indians are referred to as the battleaxe of the lord bagley works all the tired mormon sterotypes possible to rationalize his bias bagley insists he uses logic to put together the puzzle of mountain meadows he sez gov young apostle smith contributed to the tinderbox creating the conditions for the massacre in the context of looming war i agree because young smith had every reason to believe they were about to be attacked drivenexterminated by the us army while trying to pin contextual blame on young smith bagley brazenly fails to acknowledge the elephant in the tent pres buchanan and the us army this massacre would absolutely not have happened had it not been for the bigoted and reckless warmongering by pres buchanan to send the army to utah regardless of the murder of parley p pratt if bagley wants to apportion blame on young smith and is so insistant on an apology repentance of the contemporary lds church why doesn t he also demand the same of pres buchanan s successors the u s army and the descendents of the corrupt federal appointees who clearly harrassed the saints if he is so convinced of the benign behavior of the fancher party who stampeded utah with their very large and presumably hungry cattle herd remember utah is a desert with little grass unlike arkansas why can t he give a scintilla of benefit ofthedoubt to gov young and the mormons clearly bagley is pandering to those mormon haters whose mind is already made up and can t be confused with fact the bottom line is this southern utah mormons got caught up in the war hysteria caused by the outrageously unwarranted march of the us army feared that once again they as a people would be driven over reacted to an emigrant party that was at the wrong place at the wrong time and commited a horrible atrocity much to the chagrin of the mormon haters the act was local perhaps for bagley s sake mark hoffman can discover a document that could really indict gov young as the great nephew of juanita brooks bagley s presuming to carry on the truthful inquiry she initiated is a farce brooks did not have an axe to grind as bagley obviously does perhaps bagley would do better to try his hand at writing comic books 
blackstone audio is awful the blackstone audio book version of turn of the screw is read by pat bottino mr bottino s uninspired presentation destroyed the story perhaps mr bottino got better in later ventures i don t know but he mangled turnavoid this version at all costs 
for those who like this kind of book if you think you d find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting then you ll enjoy this book 
just ok i bought this book hopeing to get into shape for my wedding i find it dificult to follow yes she does map out a plan but you have to filp back and forth and practilly memorize the book before you go to the gym to get the moves down ! 
lots of information poorly written ths book contains lots of information about what ought to happen in order to make a good golf swing however the writing style is so ungrammatical as to make the information inaccessible to me i had to focus so hard on reading the words that i was unable to grasp the essential concepts that kelly is trying to get across 
trying to finish it this book is very hard to read excruciatingly painful in dull plot as well as the overly wordy text i am going to finish it as an exercise in tenacity 
instructions not included this book is for very experienced quilters only in my opinion i didn t see instructions regarding how to sew the various block parts together to make the block this book might be a good idea to get for picking a block but then you d have to go elsewhere for instructions on how much fabric to buy and how to make it into something i am very disappointed 
b oring a ferocious beast that loves mickey mouse capable of ripping two armed policemen to shreds capable of eluding the marines in the wilderness all these talents and the final encounter with this terrible monster is so anticlimatic it made me resent having wasted my time with the novel and the ending horrible it was as if koontz thought the audience of this novel would be teenagers looking for something like r l stine would write i d give it a half a star if i could 
sorry rey sorry rey i see you took the time to write a review next time i lend you abook i ll be sure to read it more closely first 
horrible kevin knows how to sell a book and he knows how to keep the money he doesn t know anything about the subject he supposedly is writing about but he knows what is most important to him if he can trick you into buying this book with a money back guarantee you will tend not to return the book no matter how bad it is and it is 
just a bunch of pictures and none i haven t seen elsewhere in my other diy garden project books i was not inspired 
not a keeper this is a beautiful book for the coffee table but forget the kitchen unless you have a brigade of chefs most of the ingredients are special purchase not something you would have in your pantry a cup of blood anyone and what the hell is paradise as in a few grains of paradise i can t even find that one in my dictionary of foods and cooking terms i am an excellent cook with more than years of cooking experience thomas kellers the french laundry was workable albeit complicated a cup of blood anyone i think i have left after paying more than plus shipping for this book not from amazon amazon i have learned my lesson i will write times i will not buy books from any source other than amazon and i will not pay shipping on purchases over thank you however i will keep this book and frame it as a reminder never to purchase thru over priced cook book clubs membership now canceled 
am i the only one i read this book many years ago and thought it was terrible looking through the reviews just now i couldn t believe how overwhelmingly positive they were and just had to put in a word for those of us and i assume hope there are others who didn t like the book the book is ludicrously long and meanders through way too many red herrings dead ends and nonsequitirs there are any number of sub plots that appear out of nowhwere go nowhere never pay off and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all the sub plots though are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself it s a very uninspiring story about a business deal will person a get the contract or will person b a business deal who cares spoiler alert and then after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal at the end one of the characters randomly dies and the whole thing just peters out no climax no drama nothing i also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters i found that clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect carried out too far in this book all of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on these are not real people they re supermen who i couldn t relate to at all its boring it s long it s badly written i was particularly disappointed because i loved shogun and liked tai pan and king rat but after this one i ve never read another clavell book and i don t think i will 
unscientific lots of pretty pictures but there is no evidence that any of these creatures will exist in the future the concepts of things like the ocean phantom have no relation to fact it s just pure speculation on the part of these biologists and they seem to have gone back in time with the toraton the animals today are far more interesting and they re real 
disappointed lacks practical application this was my first kay arthur book i am comparing it to the impact philip yancey s and max lucado s books had on me i even listened times through to make sure i wasn t missing something i gained no deeper perspective of covenant with god nor was i able to glean anything from the tapes to make practical application in my life most disturbing was her reference to jesus christ going to hell after the crucifixion this is just not true christ did not descend to hell to pay any debt we owed it was all finished on the cross thusly he proclaimed quotfather into thy hands i commit my spirit quot also the gospel of john records jesus as saying quotit is finished quot i cannot recommend this book 
poorly written and edited nothing new here i wish i hadn t wasted my money on this book i used to work for rand for twelve years and was always amazed at the poor writing abilities of rand scholars this book does capture this element of rand and military research culture the essays appear to be unedited and a few of them for example rubinstein amp harrell s disjointed chapters are so poorly written and edited that they read as if they were parts of several papers quickly jammed together simons chapter is silly and seems to have been written as a way of rationalizing her training of those who combine anthropology and violence too bad there wasn t more time put into the editing and writing this book there must be more to the views of these authors but this book is so poorly produced that there is little of any value to be found here very disapointing as i d hoped to find more on the secret culture of power that i worked in for so long at rand instead we are left with these blurry images already well known to the public 
love is not a game this book did not work for me i believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship in this book the author rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex personally i m not looking to trick anyone into going out with me or fall in love how i open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as i m walking around after i ve opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play the game properly i don t feel that it s a game it s about being true to ourselves it s about relating being best friends and we are not peacocks displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time we are empowered with language i m more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as gray does authors that i recommend are charlotte kasl john welwood and john stoltenberg good luck ! 
absolute trash what sort of racist trash is this as an asian i was extremely insulted by the occasional racial slurs against asians in this book chinese people like nothing better than eating dogs japanese men are still saying outdated sexist things like men know better women no listen i stopped reading after the first few chapters which i only read because i was bored out of my mind i m a big fan of chick lit but even i thought it was pretty damn bad writing sex and the city may have gained fame by being incorporated into a tv series but that doesn t have anything to do with bushnell s writing skills its just about the plot yet another brainless book by a talentless hack 
not for me tsukiyama knows hwo to write beautifully but her metaphors and poeticisms feel too contrived this novel is for lonely flighty housewives if you enjoy daytime soaps and or exoticized perversions of the asian culture you ll love dreaming water 
a big disappointment after all the rave reviews i thought this would be a great book on practice management what i got was a book by deena katz on deena katz for example in discussing contact management systems she glosses over act ! and goldmine barely mentions text library system and protracker but spends considerable time talking about paying to have a consultant design a system if you currently have a fee only practice that is grossing in the high figures and want to develop it into a multi million firm like deena katz then i suggest you read this book 
something like an enema i m going to wait until it gets cold enough to burn this guy s book oblivion couldn t be a better title while reading these stories i couldn t actually bear to finish even one of them you feel as if you have entered some circle of hell and your punishment is to have to read all this crap this guy makes me mad his prose actually bores into your skull it feels like torture to read and you want to say enough yes i will tell you anything you want to hear but please just shut the blank up 
laughable cliches horrible ego there are numerous laughable cliches peppered throught this novel one example that actually had me giggling out loud in embarrassment for the writers was where we find dirk jr and sister chained up in a cavern with the water level slowly very slowly rising will they free themselves in time will dirk make yet another cliched joke at the most tensionfilled moment why are there no guards to make sure they can t escape and finally where are the sharks with lazers seriously the scene reminded me of the austin powers film but what really made me throw the book down in disgust was the introduction of a new character at page described as a man who s bluegreen eyes seemed to twinkle with mischief this roguish character s name clive cussler are you kidding me is cussler s ego so bloated that he has to force himself into the story at the expense of the reader s submersion skip this one folks and let s pray that cussler isn t becoming the m night shyalaman of the literary world 
factual and typographical errors after the third or fouth factual error i teach ethernet technologies and the fifth or sixth typesetting error missing or partial paragraphs i finally tracked down the publishing house and told them of my disappointment they sent out another book without the typesetting errors but it didn t set my mind at ease about the factual errors 
not a useful book for learning and reference this is not the kind of book that you want to keep on your bookshelf for future reference it comes with relatively poor index examples and structure it s always hard to find useful information from this book when you want to find something for reference i ll go for other verilog books 
master of mixed metaphors don t believe the hype this book is not a masterpiece but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don t quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you ll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in justine it took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book the narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture but what kept me going were durrell s secondary characters he has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in justine are striking emotional and entertaining i am glad that i was able to make it to the end of the novel there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while but i do regret that i recommended this novel to my bookgroup and i do not plan to complete the quartet 
ridiculous while i think laura albert writes beautifully in her next published work the heart is deceitful above all things sarah is very poorly written anyone who has ever even visited the south should know that this is the product of an imagination scarred by beverly hillbilly s reruns and repeat viewings of deliverance 
way way below standards this book is the last straw for me i m an ardent fan of jg s since the clayborne brides heartbreaker and mercy were quite good and i expected better stuff from then on instead we get the same predictable setting and prototype characters she seems to want to write a book of all the buchanan brothers very very disappointing thus far murder list was excruciating and when i thought that things couldn t get worse she comes up with slow burn i d wish she d just write noah clayborne s book and be done with the whole series hopefully she d write a great book for noah clayborne 
the worst of several genres i love mysteries set in ww ii and like old time radio so i couldn t wait to begin this one the hero is a junior varsity tom joad but ok i was game the cast of characters that seemed to number in the low s and be interchangable baddies and goodies they were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and i pushed on then when we got to the jersey shore i found out that in with america fighting for it s life against fascism and losing our hero knew why all the servicemen were bullies a drafted station employee or morons the coast guard beach patrol the f hero was the real mccoy however although not actually mentioned i bet he wished that dratted ear injury hadn t kept him from joining the abraham lincoln brigade he was moderate enought to think marxism had some problems the murder of s of millions of ukrainians and the nazi ussr pact probably and i say probably didn t elude our observant literary genius he was also a era feminist all those plucky ww ii women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support most big businessmen probably wearing spats and silk high hats were the bad guys needless to say i wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book i couldn t finish it and it s a point of honor for me to finish all books then in the bio it all became clear the author was a flack for former congresswoman pat schroeder of colorado i m still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated quaker schoolmarm expression that said somebody somewhere is having fun and i want it to stop now anyone who could stand to work for pat could write this book with ease 
semi boring this book seemed politically written the quotrightquot word took center stage over the substance 
ultimately simplistic this book has its good points the editorial review mentions dynamism and the lectures are certainly that also when the review argues that this book is a sort of manifesto of the author s vision i wholeheartedly agree it is nice to read a coherent perspective on writing and the process of artistic creation from a writer that does not sacrifice passion for some kind of mechanistic clarity or something of the sort however the ideas are ultimately simplistic i would even argue that they are harmful ideas if not taken with a grain of salt i for one stop trusting anyone who begins to put a limit on what writing can be writing is feelings not thoughts this is literature this is non literature that sort of thinking it is another situation where an author has wrestled with himself and the establishment to find a unique voice but who after becoming legitimate would like to close the door on what other voices might sound like and it doesn t come as any surprise to me that butler in his picture of what good literature is composed of manages to overlook a dimension missing from his own works lets call it an artistic blindspot i think robert olen butler is a very good writer particularly in the short story form he has achieved some moments of brilliance and excellence but his short stories read like long prose poems and when he tries to lengthen or elaborate them they fall apart under their own weight this is why his books or novella length works do not operate as well when i compare his works to those of a greater writer say a william faulkner a joseph conrad a henry miller a norman mailer and that s no mean company i m putting him in i find that what is missing is the intellect but writers are not intellectuals yes there s a dimension of ideas that exists in all of those authors works that is missing in butler s works his argument of course is that that dimension doesn t exist for any purpose but to illuminate some system of emotions that is in play within the work that a work is ultimately only for the expression of some unique emotion it doesn t surprise me then that his work is exceptionally powerful in one direction but it falls flat in a number of other ways his most successful work a good scent from a strange mountain benefitted greatly from its timely political setting and topic in a sense butler could do what he does best simply represent the emotional movement of characters and the profundity of the period and the larger issue at stake helped to make up for and in some ways substitute for the lack of this other dimension in any case for a new writer to take butler s ideas in this book as gospel would be to limit him or herself greatly an older writer could probably better benefit from the collected lectures a pleasant enough read if you remember to hold it at arm s length and to eye it critically no i wouldn t say this author has found the way 
a bit disappointed i have read several of nicholas sparks books but this one was different for me it was a very very slow start i was more than pages into it before i got interested in the plot i had even considered quitting reading it at times it ended up being an okay story but nothing that i couldn t have lived without reading what i did enjoy is the way mr sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were i would suggest another read from mr sparks like the notebook or the wedding if you want a good romantic read 
poorly written review of a very interesting premise janet malcolm takes a very interesting premise the relationship of a journalist to his subject and turns it into a trite essay on the gruesome macdonald murders the book s words seem to indicate that malcolm herself fell for macdonald s smooth veneer she waxes longingly about the fact that he can break a doughnut and not drop any of the sugar ! who cares had she stuck to her subject matter the relationship between journalist and the one being written about this could have been a good book but the book s contents indicate to me that malcolm had another hidden agenda that involved her choice of the heinous macdonald as subject matter 
no no no not this book if you know x p pro in supporting enviroment then this book will be good for you but if you are new to the helpdesk field like i was when i took this test you will possibly due horribly like i did do your self a favor and pick up the self paced training kits from and by walter glenn much better books much more thorough practice tests this cram book is for people that wanna waste money 
also horrified like horrified above i was appalled by the glibness with which this book rationalized diana s support of fascism and nazism the author treats diana and unity s commitment to fascism as an understandable flaw rather like a tendency to split infinitives or something even going so far as to try to play down mosley s politics as someone who has read mosley s book i was simply astonished at lovell s treatment of him and diana lovell mentions that people have a tendency to fall in love with diana and forgive her everything clearly that s what lovell did 
writing is good but the stories awful i agree on the following points great concept great writing style good command of language but for the rest the stories were too bizzare they were too warped and ugly to fall into a category of good reading they were neither original or imaginative dasgupta s formula seems to be take a well known fable fairy tale like rapunzel and bluebeard set it in one of the world s well known capitals paris tokyo delhi and then throw in some sci fi events make a series of progressively darker and bizzare events happen and then either provide a sadistic ending or a nice happily ever after ending in one case he has twisted the story of the sailor and the albatross to convert it into the story of a wingless bird that unites two lovers there is too much of gross descriptions and stuff in the book as well 
fails to get the message across as other reviewers have mentioned because of the made up disease which causes her to gain weight and failure of the character to really learn what she needs to learn from this experience it is sort of a waste could have been written better and doesn t get to the heart of the matter 
history of hydrogen would be a reasonable title but this still would not make up for the disarray this book is in the author has a lot of interesting information but tomorrows energy te is very poorly compiled and editted making it very difficult to read or skim through i have another book i would recommend in place of this one but i will hold off until the end of this review because te should be fully addressed there is almost no foresight in this book te reads almost like hydrogen is just a fuel of the past when in fact many of us hope and expect it will one day be our fuel of choice even in the last chapter the next years the author just continues quoting away and giving speculation by others instead of reflecting on where hydrogen is going to go from his expertise his perspective would have been nice since he has obviously done a lot of research on the topic the book reads like a collection of essays by the author on historical bits about hydrogen instead of telling us who did what on what date and here is what the person who did it had to say it would have been far more useful to have the author explain in his own words what is going on and break the book into smaller sections if necessary which really is necessary since there are so many random discussions it is painful also as slezak mentioned the units gj btu s calories you name it it s in here are flip flopped throughout the book making it incredibly difficult to follow the numbers which is really relavent information to this topic the only type of person who will find te useful over the book below is someone who wants to know a lot of details about the history of hydrogen and less about whether it will be useful for us in the future now my recommendation the hype about hydrogen thah by joseph rommthah is still a little dry but it does magnitudes better than te and it is consistent with units and has pretty clear descriptions i couldn t put thah down i finished it in less than days but after getting into te about pages i dreaded going back to it i made myself finish te because i looked forward to what i expected to be the forward thinking last chapter which as mentioned above was a great disappointment im a diligent slow reader 
this book sucks who is the reader that gave this book stars this booklet is a bunch of rambling from a guy who knows nothing of the medical billing industry his computer illiteracy is apparent from his writing but i don t think he knows it he suggests backing up your hard drive with mp disks what is mp he gives advice on how to sound professional in order to impress health professionals i am a health professional and i would laugh in your face if you came to an interview telling me that junk he claims to have a formula for success make cold calls a week send out literature times a week that s all it takes to be successful in this field ! not he also devotes chapters on insurance no not health insurance but insurance to cover your computer in case it gets hit by lightning like his did three chapters for something that should take one sentence this book is a total joke i wasted plus shipping plus time spent scanning the pages i ordered his full sized book on medical billing but decided to cancel once i sampled his writing style in this booklet total garbage which is where i tossed this booklet after reading it 
cheated i began reading forever amber last week hoping to find a book i might like while i waited for another one to come available at the library and from the first i wasn t sure i was going to enjoy this book but i am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it upon finishing it i feel cheated the book isn t all that bad there is a lot of movement intrigue and history in it but i couldn t feel for the characters the main character amber was not someone that i would like and even when things went wrong for her i still felt that way i assume that no one is supposed to like her and although i didn t like any of the characters in this book i guess i did feel something for amber because i felt like she should be with lord carlton up in until the last part of the book then i realized that she shouldn t be with anyone the reason for the two stars is because of the ending i hated that ending i felt totally cheated after reading the whole plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly i agree with others who have left reviews here it seems that the author decided that she either didn t want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about anyway it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book i have been waiting for becomes available but i would never recommend this book to anyone it s really not worth the time i guess you either love the book or you hate it and i hated it 
um the s are over robert putnam s book bemoans the declne in civic participation among americans since its heyday in the s and s although few would argue that bridge clubs aren t what they used to be who would have predicted the rise of member mega churches back in this underlines the basic problem with this book it focuses too much on what constituted communities and activities in the past without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today while i agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index and participation in traditional formal organizations has declined i would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the st century has risen for example while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual party system college students today volunteer more that any generation before them in addition while participation in mainline protestant churches has stedily declined engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically while i personally feel that the sterile suburban drive everywhereinmysuv existance is soul crushing and the popularity of reality tv may be a sign of the apocolypse i also don t pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week while dad worked returned home to supper and went to the men s club on tuesdays at and while putnam s basic premise may resonate with many its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument 
not helpful i returned this book it is boring and seems very old fashioned more like a textbook than a parent guide which was what i was looking for 
gave it one star because i couldn t give it zero there are two types of writers one writes to inform the reader the other writes to try to impress other writers mr reese tried the latter but didn t acomplish either reading this book is like trying to understand a sloppy drunk stranger explaining why his wife left him it doesn t make sense and it s b oringits ironic that a frenchman with a german mother who also spent wwii in the german army on the eastern front and who never claimed to be a writer guy sajer wrote the book that is everything that reese s book wanted to be and isn tif you are looking for the ultimate cant put it down memoir of a soldier that brings home the horrors of war along with humanity at it s best and worst get forgotten soldier by guy sager like coke it s the real thing 
rima needs to read keynes s gt especially chapter there are just too many errors of interpretation omission and commission in this book to justify purchasing it in this review we will concentrate on rima srhandling of the work of j m keynes on p rs claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is quotsurprisingly suggestive quot of j m keynes s idea has no supporting evidence to back it up on p r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand a la keynes what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and or intuition that ricardo s deductive analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking or assuming away the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo in chapter of r s book she attempts to deal with keynes s theory of effective demand and keynes s discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter titled quotthe employment function quotr should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book replacing her chapter with keynes s chapter rs figure discussed on pages directly contradicts keynes s analysis 
just such a disapointment not worth the minutes it takes to read this bookle 
find an old edition if similar find an old edition of this book if the editions are similar the cases in it are old so the law isn t really changing so if you can tolerate not being on the exact same page in class can deal with figuring out the different pages save your money since this text is hard to follow ! the notes and problems aren t helpful 
a waste of money we are simply told how the truth has been sold to us i don t see why a historian should write a book to tell us what we already knew from the movies although any american will agree with his sentiments 
a very credible book except it was interesting to read a review that commented it is still true you can not find any study in those countries about christianity that statement is absolute fiction of course especially in the jesuit schools in syria perhaps in the west it has slipped our minds that jesus was born in the middle east and we adopted this middle east religion from them the eastern churches very much study christianity and many muslims around them in the levant since jesus is reverred in islam john the baptist s head is maintained in a memorial monument in the middle of the ommayad mosque in damascus the most noted manuscripts used for our common bibles today were discovered in alleppo syriacursory research reveals lewis s connections to intelligence and that speaks for itself this book should be read to balance it in conjunction with hostage to khomeini and venices war against western civilization unless one wishes to be taken for a very sophisticated ride better still one could reside in the middle east for a while and see for one s self instead of amplifying other people s writings without the slightest ability credential or experience to determine whether or not they might be accurate but be ready for shock it has little in common to the psy ops portraits we have been spoon fed with by western media moronic television porgammes suchas fox and artful books such as this its still a fine read and awfully convincing it hit it s mark in that respect much knowledge on christianity one wonders of the author hails from christian ancestors continuing the other review that people in the middle east would supposedly benefit greatly from reading this book was also amusing to say the least people from the middle east would benefit best from a good lawyer and a truth serum given the looting and plunder of their resources 
choppy this novel reads more like an outline with big holes in both the character development and the plot unlike the professional reviews i didn t mind the excerpts that were the foundation of the historical quest what bothered me were the characters themselves i found their behavior to be at times bizarre and had a hard time liking any of them the situations and the characters reactions were far fetched with no surrounding build up of detail to back up the plot i give this stars for originality and stars for detail and character development 
a map that shows you half the city it just seems that they forgot one half of the map 
the chocolate war the chocolate warthe chocolate war was one of the best books i have ever read not the chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene the boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot i would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate i don t think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level this story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out i think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of archie archie is a suspicious character that knows every one i wish this book was more school appropriate but it isn t and was a horrid book therefore this book would be great if the author published a book with the sam story but more school appropriate situations and words 
deserves negative stars jon katz is an idiot anyone who sells him a dog better be prepared for him to kill the dog rather than deal with any issues although this book is being sold as a nice dog story it is anything but jon katz once again decides to kill his dog rather than put himself out in an earlier book he killed his supposedly beloved labs because he couldn t bear to see them anything less than healthy in this book he decides to kill his supposed soul mate dog devon aka orson because he does not want to be bothered to manage the dog s enviroment orson bites a couple of people and katz decides he doesn t want to be bothered keeping the dog in an enclosed yard because it would be a prison if you are a dog lover do not buy this book you will just be pissed off by katz s behavior 
a mishmash of proven lies and half truths i read this book years ago when it was first published mr sick allowed himself to be taken in by a collection of iranian liars as well as some phonies claiming to have experience in intelligence some of the people sick listened to were shown in the iran contra hearings to be con artists who also took in ollie north and bill casey these con artists are experts at saying what the listener wants to hear one guy claimed to have been in special forces and was an eyewitness to one of vp candidate bush s flights to meet with iranians it turns out that he was not in special forces at all and he had been dishonorably discharged from the us army in addition he could not have been an eyewitness to the event he claims to have seen because he was in jail at the time the phony intelligence specialists have also been proven to be liars with no experience in intelligence or anything resembling national security work by the time i finished this book i actually felt sorry for sick because he had allowed himself to be taken in by these jokers he clearly wanted to believe that what he was being told was true this book does not prove anything except that even an experienced researcher can be fooled if he really wants to believe subsequent investigations by a democratically dominated congress proved that there was no october surprise 
terrified mother the story goes beyond bad this is a story of three little girls that torture and kill the wolf in a premeditated way my year old son was very sad after someone read the story to him in a school interview to preschool he said to me that it was a bad story and the girls have done bad choices i can t believe this is in the list of books recommended for and s 
this one s no good where s the flash book we all need i have to add my vote to the reviewers who consider the book pretty awful the pictures are indeed uniformly terrible and the content is a disorganized hodge podge barely succeeding in sticking to the subject of flash photography it also seems true that there aren t many books on the subject attention photography writers ! here s a big opportunity for an imaginative and authoritative writer on this subject where are you this is such an important and confusing topic and of course amateur photography is burgeoning now surely you can outdo ms mccartney and rake in the dough 
disappointed this book was suggested to me by a dear friend though the concept of servant leadership is strong i am sure i don t want to read this book again to understand it 
great topic but literary esque treatment of it i like cross disciplinarity the world needs it but when one crosses to fields with rigorous methods highly standardized and specified and well competed in from fields with ambiguous methods not at all standardized hence with only vague impressionistic competition in them the result is great topics pursued with halting poorly executed methods in the case of this book cognitive science topics pursued with literature department mapping of metaphors methods produces a highly repetitious book with not a single insight not one not one not more than one and not one that is no insights none am i getting through simply mapping one metaphor after another ad infinitum with no insights from the first mapping any elementary school kid would produce a similar mapping if coaxed a little i am afraid and even less from the second tenth twentieth does not produce anything but enought pages to publish i have to admit i got suckered and put out my money for this thing because the topic interested me i should have examined how the topic is treated before buying aw well live and learn 
female chauvinist our church book study group mistakenly purchased this bad girls of the bible instead of the one by the other author while i had great difficulty getting through the first chapter i am now using this book to improve my understanding of the bible and to learn more about ancient times this writer makes up her own story lines and conveniently leaves out portions of chapters and verses that do not fit her story line for example in chapter two she states that egypt where joseph is held as a slave by potiphar is a dry hot land perhaps she should read just a little earlier in the bible in genesis we are told different lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the jordan was well watered like the garden of the lord like the land of egypt toward zoar while the ordering of this book was a mistake on the part of the person who ordered the books for us i believe it is a godsend for us to read and discuss this book though i doubt we will actually be using the questions at the end of each chapter instead we will ask questions regarding her inaccurate portrayal of these women and the facts of history 
very disappointed i am very disappointed with the recipes in this book i love to cook love to try new recipes and bought this book on the strength of others reviews i ve tried recipes straight out of the book with no adaptation of them were ok but had little flavor the other were barely edible with strange flavors another reviewer said this book is a good spring board for crockery cooking i would definately say that you need to be experienced enough with the crock pot and spice usage in general to adapt these recipes to taste in order to enjoy recipes from this book 
fraud michael bellesiles resigned after a panel of scholars from places such as harvard and princeton concluded his failure to cite sources for material in his book arming america 
too old this book is now years old lot of informations are missing now 
good information buried in fluff this author needs to take two classes at whichever university she teaches instructional design and writing concisely this book has quite a lot of good information but it is all buried within convoluted fluff there are many other books on research methodology that a do a better job of explaining b include more comprehensive rules for research and c don t take up so much of your valuable time with fluff i recommend you look at those other books especially if you are a professor who is choosing a book for your students 
i ll keep looking before i move into my actual review i want to correct a factual error in another review the criticism was made that edelman uses too much technical and specific terminology with no explanation for the reader this is false while edelman buries the reader in technical terms the book contains an extensive glossary pages vs pages of actual text which explains every term used the reviewer that made this criticism was simply too lazy to reference it although it should be noted that edelman perhaps made the wrong decision by relying on the glossary instead of including explanatory foot or endnotes that said i am a well educated non specialist reader i am not a biologist or a psychologist i sought this book out in an attempt to find good entry level works on the study of consciousness to assist with research i am currently involved in this book received some praise as the best text to begin with so i investigated with the hope of getting a quick and solid grounding in the basics of the field with all due deference to a nobel laureate i can not recommend this book to the intended general audience despite the disproportionately large glossary it is difficult to follow edelman s prose style is murky and redundant most readers will make heavy use of that glossary sadly the most engaging parts of the text are year old quotes from william james whose descriptions edelman acknowledges as a highwater mark in the field much of the text reads unfortunately like a specialized research paper that has had one quick pass by an editor to try to make it more approachable coverage of the physical biological and neurological components underlying consciousness wanders the principle behind the organization of the chapters what each contains and why serves only to emphasize the subjective nature of consciousness if the way edelman renowned in this field organizes his material and reaches his conclusions is typical of fellow studiers of consciousness god help the rest of us distilled down there is still good material here difficult as it will be for the non specialist to wade through for example a reasonably understandable picture of brain function emerges as does a useful model for the primary consciousness experienced by many animals distinct from the higherorder consciousness assumed by edelman to be unique to man and a few other primates there is a manageable explanation of one theory of consciousness tngs some of the most interesting material describes magnetoencephalographic studies which unfortunately receives too little coverage my biggest problem with the book is that despite its brevity it actually takes far too many pages to say what it does it seemed to me that in the end too much space is devoted to explaining and elaborating a single topic it becomes not much more than a marginally useful introduction to edelman s personal theory of consciousness tngs the theory of neuronal group selection tngs might be the be allandendall of consciousness theory i don t know enough about the field to judge but this book fails the reader in this regard by going out of its way to neglect competing theories one must either take tngs or leave it because there is no serious attempt to offer an alternative the book has served primarily to pique my interest in other work the ideas of reentry and the remembered present for example seem solid and appropriate and will inform my future research even an idea like degeneracy which in the end i find difficult to support is worth knowing while the complete book does serve to inform a lay reader such as myself with a useful if elementary understanding of the possible evolutionary and biological basis of consciousness it falls short of being accessible my search for a truly accessible introductory work on the study of consciousness continues 
what really works i find books like this help you with opening remarks like simple one liner ice breakers ok so they feed you some lines and then what are you supposed to talk about if you don t know many people at the event it s hard to come up with something interesting that won t end with you red faced or with your foot firmly in your mouth i find online knowledge services like agogus com are very helpful in this respect more that these kinds of books i have more confidence to start a conversation now that i have a wide knowledge of all kinds of topics it s even fun to go to holiday parties not a pain like it used to be 
disappointing very i have loved this series from the beginning great characters fun stories thrills and romance very light quick reads that are great entertainment this story was awful there were two mysteries one was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding and the other was so convoluted i didn t even get it a comment was made that one person when convicted wouldn t be around to hurt anyone any more but this person wasn t even the perp for the big mystery and the epilogue who was that person and how did they figure it out too many holes for an otherwise easy read finally the characterization was off the normal comraderie between the girls was missing i felt no love from the original three for yuki in spite of her storyline if there s a sixth story i hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books i m giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends if i had just picked up the series with this book it would be a one sorry james 
spew and nonsense from a sleaze merchant james baker of f the jews infamy claims that he never wanted to involved in politics it might have been better for all americans lebanese chinese israelis and others had he heeded his own advice not only an incompetent secretary of state who created messes wherever he stepped but a guy who never met a dictatorship or a totalitarian regime he never liked remember baker is the guy who told us to move on while the chinese communists were butchering students in tianamin square the guy who allowed syria to brutally take over lebanon just prior to the gulf war slaughtering christians while this churchgoer and his churchgoing boss bush i just twiddled their thumbs this is the guy who also whitewashed the intelligence pointing to direct syrian involvement in the downing of pan am flight over lockerbie an event that encouraged one osama bin laden later on baker bluntly told israel to stay out of the first gulf war had israel told this bigot to shove off we might not have had to deal with the morass iraq has turned out to be and the current president bush a much more courageous and honest man than daddy would not have to call on this sleaze operator for help israel of course was rewarded by baker after scud strikes first with heavy handed demands to appease both syria and the palestinians when israel did so baker twisted the knife into the back of israel withholding loan guarantees promised before the first gulf war began then by saying f the jews they didn t vote for us anyway not a patriot nor a good or even competent secretary of state but an operator a sleaze merchant and a bigot he should have heeded his own advice and did the american people a favor amazon stop practicing censorship 
how about a zero star rating very disappointing and boring ! no likeable characters very uninteresting story could would not finish too many better books waiting 
am i missing something perhaps i just bought the wrong book for what i wanted to do or maybe i just don t get it but in either case this book left me very underwhelmed i work at an isp where we use ldap for a number of purposes from authenticating customers connecting to our network to e mail filtering to htaccess authentication on our internal use web servers while i am comfortable using an ldap browser to manage our users in ldap i really wanted more of an idea about how to set up and run an ldap directory so i bought this book to help me understand ldap schemas while this book does describe a lot of the background to ldap directories it really didn t do much to fill in what i am missing how do you design an ldap schema how do you know when to use ou o etc on the plus side i really did appreciate the overview of various ldap products currently available and was pleased to see that all of the ldap products i have used at work openldap iplanet directory server and or course active directory were described along with their relative strengths and weaknesses however i really expected a little more meat and maybe not quite as much background about implementing an ldap directory than i found in this book in short if you want a general overview of ldap directories this might be what you want but if you are looking for a how to guide you probably should keep looking 
all s well that ends well this is a novel in superlative style heroic magnanimous exalted brightly caressingly exquisite fascinating wonderful sublime radiant delightful it confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished europeans with members of a wealthy boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love there is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social mental difference between europe and the us at the end of the th century this book doesn t say nothing thomas hardy quoted in the introduction but nearly nothing it hardly surpasses the level of a three penny stationary novel compared with the works of a dostoevsky or a flaubert it is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily only for henry james fans 
cat s eye witness what happened i have really been enjoying the sneaky pie brown series up till now found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters they weren t very likeable conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line there was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved and the condition in which the murder victim s were found more graphic than it needed to be ms brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read jud 
disappointing i wasn t too into this one i m a big fan of steinbeck s fiction but this memoir is rather dull i was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of america at the time he wrote it but as an older man as he even admits he isn t as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths the ones that he does write about come across as a bit uninspired nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn t have too much to say the one highlight was the last couple of chapters when he goes to the south new orleans and witnesses all the slimy seperatists as they scream and holler with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools he is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking as much as a mediocre work as it was i did take an interest in it because i am a fan of steinbeck it was cool to hear him write a memoir other steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them i recommend it just on that basis as long as you take into account the stuff i said above if you haven t read steinbeck please start with the grapes of wrath or tortilla flat those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
please find another calculus book let me put it bluntly my instructor uses this book as little as possible due to the incredibly overdone style in which the text and problems are written calculus is difficult enough as it is but this book makes it virtually impossible to comprehend user un friendly petition your math department to choose another text 
i d laugh if it weren t so pathetic book starts of with is this a con like it s a hint of what s to come childish stories about how the doctrines of the worldwide church were allwrong and suddenly needed to be changed maybe the recruitment tactics were not working anymore or the false prophecies scandals and financial ruin of its members had taken their toll on the organization it was time to turn this thing around but what they did sunk the ship and maybe that was their intent ! sure sounds like a conspiracy theory and sure enough it seemed that way as the news of coming changes leaked out only to confuse the once faithful why would ministers preach what they didn t believe well the money and benefits were pretty good strange how the sabbath changed along with unclean meats holydays tithing healing etc looks like tkatch found the stairway to heaven and armstrong was no longer the infallible pope even the holy spirit changed into a person and what the pagan trinity and the symbol of the cross became kosher the book mentions herbert w armstrong being the master salesman and likea bar a soap he had to make his church unique so his followers would use no other he started positioning his product by identifying all others as inferior or even worthless as misleading as spurious and even hurtful of course he will have to use basically the same ingredients for his soap that they do in theirs but will change the name of those ingredients we were told that we were the only true soap so when tkatch and co began admitting we weren t the only real soap out there it all started to look so bogus in their disillusionment many members started spinning off to splinter groups quite a few abandoned religion altogether and tried to live a normal life again that was the real transformation as nauseating and heart breaking as you would ever experience how could we have believed such things by the means of fear induction psychology and mind control by its leaders this cult and its many divisions have manipulated the lives of its members and destroyed their lives the book ends up bashing old armstrong pretty well but contradictorily says they are not judging him makes it worth the the printed version is going for but do a search and save the postage unless you need the kindling for the survivors does anyone remember laughter 
this book is bad this won a pulitzer for reasons i don t understand maybe it s because i m not sophisticated enough but after reading gunter grass i m starting to think literary awards are given out on the basis of how regular and detailed the physical descriptions of male genitalia and its veins are in the book this is a leaving las vegas style story about a guy who decides to drink himself to death the only problem is he s lived his whole life and settled in to die by a quarter of the way through the book this book gives you empathy with the main character not by putting you in his skin through skilled storytelling but by boring you to the point you yourself know what it s like to want to die this book seems mainly to be loved by those who deem it a mark of sophistication to like things most people find offensive sex foul language crude descriptions they re all fine as a means to an end but this books parades them for no literary purpose i can detect this book has interesting elements but it s bad 
very disappointing this book was very disappointing it was written in a stream of consciousness style with bizarre attempts to integrate modern analogies and to compare david to modern figures from unrelated fields i had the feeling that it was written in one weekend without the scholarly research for which i would have hoped 
disappointing and predictable this novel was a selection of my book club and as such it was a letdown while you could classify the book as a good read so is a lot of mass market fiction the characters are not well developed and the author doesn t portray them subtly or fully enough for you to care about them the plot as well as the writing is cliche ridden and the ending is pat it is clear early on that the sisters will mend their relationship find true love and all will work out in the end if you are looking for a recent well written book about sisters with more interesting plots and characterization and a nice dose of humor try case histories by kate atkinson or rise and shine by anna quindlen a second tier anna quindlen book is sharp funny and better written than most premiere efforts by other writers 
cute concept bad book title says it all play to your strengths no need to read the book or if you must simply skim at your nearest borders barnes noble or fave store with a reputable coffeehouse my quibble is less with the authors philosophy and more with their writing this is simply not a very well written book no chapters bold headings every five sentences and endless laundry lists at last count of things to do ways to manage etc although i agree with the need to appreciate the talents of each unique individual and not dwell so much on a person s need forimprovement areas i did not think the authors proved their points they were content to slap down some famous names rehash a few entrepreneurial successes and quote the gallup polls which were self serving anyways in light of clifton s ownership of gallup please try to waste your money on something better written 
not much i would cook i returned this book as i did not see that much that i would cook 
ouch ! worse than most paperback romances this book proves once again that you don t necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market true believer is an all star team of cheap shallow cliches there is no plot no one really believes anything and everything is a contrived superficial mish mash the dialoge has no depth and when you ve had too much dialoge there s paragraph after paragraph of the main characters thinking to themselves wow is this bad message in a bottle was a great plot idea but its been a slow steady descent since then you might have a good laugh at it like i did but otherwise i was very disappointed 
riddled with errors other reviewers have pointed out the errors eric alterman makes in this book like saying that the u s was under the kyoto protocol that was particularly annoying he needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
an adequate first draft i was surprised to learn after reading bay of souls that this was robert stone s first in five years because it seemed hastily thrown together i thought the story of kirsten and michael ahearn and their son was wonderful and then more or less dropped according to his blurb at the back stone had some interactions with madison smart bell i wish he d written about haiti instead essays and finished the tale he started which was like updike with a little more edge maybe i m just not a voodoo guy but i was sorely disappointed with the promise of the beginning of this book set against its patched together ending 
half assed this books was way too overhyped upon purchasing it i was greatly dissappointed it does give an introductory crash course in some guitar theory but a lot of its information is half assed the way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that i would actually consider as being wrong a lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid who cares how to play quotlouie louie quot in a bunch of different ways but i suppose that might get you started at finding chords in more than one place on the fretboard nevertheless this book is boring and incomplete buy something else 
its lousy did not work for a relationship of marriage with a time affair involved book was good to start a fire with though make dr phil rich i recomend david deangelo instead hes much better program 
vastly over written and vastly over praised from the remarks at this site people either love this novel or hate it i hated it i hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about mfa program writing in the last years the emphasis is entirely on style forget story forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere some of this thinking goes back to henry james some of it goes back to virginia woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits like h g wells the time machine the first pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom frank bascombe is trying to sell a property it s brilliantly written in fact it s so brilliantly written that i had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life his loves and the region of the country he inhabits this book has no driving plot in fact it s an arbitrarily chosen conceit what happens on july th in the life of one guy it s not james joyce s ulysses nor is it trying to be but every thought this man has is in this book and none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person any perso should pick up the book indeed that seems to be the crux i read this book because it was by richard ford a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere you must read this book they said so i did and i consider it an extraordinary waste of my time to be sure this is a judgment call but i m allowed to make it every reader is allowed to make that call but i know i m in the minority in this this book is supposed to be one of the greatest american novels of the last years but will it be so in another years are novels now only to be interior monologues which virginia woolf preferred and said so in her essay modern fiction perhaps our values are changing perhaps the mfa programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story but what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism wherein the author writes at length putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we re supposed to what applaud it i believe that the authors we ll remember will be the natural storytellers i don t think richard ford is one of them but man he sure can write 
fun read lots of hyperbole quite biased selectively documented trying to make an exciting context the author exaggerates and connects dots that are not ther 
loved the book hated the reading this review refers to the audio book i m a huge james lee burke fan but i found the reading of this book to be unbearable i have listened to mark hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like elmore leonard but here he just sounds tired sloppy and unconvincing as a cajun reader his performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety when he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from detroit imitating gomer pyle towards the end of the reading it sounded like he needed to clear his throat if you want to hear a stellar reading try another james lee burke work purple cane road read by will patton 
disappointing i had very high hopes for this book due to its title and was looking for how to more cohesively merge buddhism with management in modern corporate america my experience is that this book neither explained buddhism correctly nor did it give good management principles it was just some light reading and common sense the meditation exercises at the end of the book were strange discussing different colors of light and using the four elements in meditation all that is needed is to focus on the breathe and observe thoughts without losing yourself in them that is true meditation simply sit this book also focused to much time and effort on the self which is the very thing we should be overcoming this is a poor book on buddhism and management keep looking 
not much of a plot oh dear i must be missing something here given the superlative reviews others have written where s the plot where s the character development where s the narrative arc where s the dramatic tension i m not quite done but i have found this book almost impossible to follow i can t get a handle on what s real in the story versus what is a dream or a fantasy the story switches back between the past and the present and the narrator s childlike voice leaves me confused as to what is actually happening not my cup of tea though i recognize i m in the minority here 
a once great book whose time has passed once upon a time i could not recommend this book highly enough that s the problem once upon a time in this book violates what i consider an overriding consideration for instruction books never distract the new user with picky details that s hell will rarely need in practice the first few chapters are written using input and datalines commands to enter data for those unfamiliar with sas that means the authors enter all of their data as lines of text typed inside their command language no one works that way any more ! it s a hold over from the days of punchcards does the new user really need to know thatinput id age gender means look in columns for a numerical id columns for numerical age and column for a character designating gender when the th edition was written the answer might have been yes but even then it would have been given grudgingly for more than a few years data almost always arrive as data sets that have already been made into sas files or as spreadsheets that can be imported directly into sas this method of data input would not be a fatal flaw if the material were in a later chapter or an appendix but it s woven throughout the text starting with the first example on page i would love to see this book updated with a more modern view to how data are processed and analyzed but i can no longer recommend it in its current form added in edit instead get a copy of the little sas book a primer third edition by lora d delwiche and susan j slaughter if i ever get around to reviewing it i ll give it or stars in the meantime there are already a bunch of reviews you can read on the book s own amazon web page mostly good a few bad for an average of stars 
needs to be more accessible conscious acts of creation the emergence of a new physics by william a tiller walter e dibble and michael j kohane publisher quality books inc pages i like and don t like this book it s billed as a book written for physics but also applicable to people into metaphysics but the problem is that the writing for this book is not intended for a general audience it s intended for an audience that has a developed awareness of the highly technical language of physics and math as such many people into metaphysics will have a hard time reading this book i did i had to read and reread many sections to try and understand the language being used a big part of the problem is that the organtization of this book s chapters is highly erratic the authors jump around a lot i actually understood a few of the final chapters but only because the language was more general i think it would have served the authors better to have put those chapters in the beginning of the text also none of the terms and acronyms were well defined or spelled out a glossary would ve done wonders for this book in defense of the book the ideas being worked with are intriguing and the authors did perk my interest and keep me reading the problem is that while this book could interest a large audience of people it can only have a big impact on a much smaller audience because of the highly technical language bizarre layout and lack of cohesion as such the potential good this book could do is marred by the inability of the authors to write in a more accessible manner i did manage to understand a fair amount of this book but i can only chalk that up to reading up a lot on physics and science i only hope that the authors other books are more accessible regrettably i have to give this book two stars out of five and recommend to the authors that they work with an editor who can help them with layout issues and with language in terms of making the language more accessible to a wider audience 
isn t this theory gibberish getting old by now no i m not going to dignify this by elaborating further this is just a link in the chain of giggle historial fiction that currently accounts for davinci code etc it s all been said before michael ho hum 
racist through and through wolfe hero worships the irish and all others rank below them the irish detective martin das fitzgibbon and caughey can do no wrong the italians jews and wasps have their good points but are flawed in one way or another at the bottom are the dark people as wolfe constantly calls them who have created a great dark hole in our once great society there is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior granted it s an entertaining read but don t be fooled 
little on detail big on boring i love true crime and that s probably the only thing that kept me reading this book this book provides very little detail on the actual crimes and concentrates more on how ng was a sadistic manipulating know itall that liked to play games but didn t like the consequences of such i generally can read a good true crime book in hours or less but this one took me almost a week instead of forsaking everything else to read this time i read when there was nothing else to do 
a lukewarm thriller with a pathetic marriage the on therock marriage scenes are pathetic making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse from the very beginning this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living yet she continuously whined intervened demanded complained pried into her husband jobs and duties what is this trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic making him look more like the stereotyped american husband making us enable to enter rapp s bedroom wathching war of the roses come on this is a thriller not jackie collins or danielle steele s honey no sex tonight get rid of the nagging wife pronto ! also this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller a story falling apart in many ways 
not a work of scholarship i returned this book i was hoping for a work of scholarship in which the author would carefully argue for his views by presenting documented research this is not the case instead the author simply throws out conjectures about the egyptian origins of the hebrew scriptures there is absolutely no attempt to connect any of this with academic egyptology or the mountains of biblical scholarship read richard friedman or mark smith or finkelstein if you re interested in genuine scholarship from a liberal skeptical point of view 
elizabeth macphearson this is the weakest book of the series i have now read them all through pms outlaws the book has the witty style of the other elizabeth macphearson mysteries but didn t hold my interest very well it is important to the series though because it tells us a lot about milo who is featured in two subsequent books and it introduces elizabeth to forensic anthropology the ending is a bit of a surprise so i guess that s in the story s favor 
preface should include a warning about the overuse of footnotes years ago i orginally bought this book right before a transatlantic flight having no idea that instead of a being a good read to pass the time that this bloated collection of footnotes would induce coma a couple of nights ago i pulled this book from my collection for another read to give it another chance dry and boorring at almost pages the author s original contribution could easily be compressed to no more than pages the other half is all annoying footnote explanations this book should be totally reorganized incorporating the footnotes into the author s independent text i realize that the author is deceased was it from footnote overdose 
revelation stretch a christian fundamentalist interpretation of islam as the beast of revelation there are better sources for an understanding of the relationship between christianity and islam 
terrible this is the first grafton book i ve read but i m pretty sure it will be my last simply put this is the worst book i ve read in the past year the plot is ridiculous it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute porn star water treatment plant worker the characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator s questions critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense 
closer to healthy than atkins but not quite there the paleo diet is based on an interesting premise the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment it seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time because their decisions are instinctual self awareness creates a problem that doesn t exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans sometimes we do things out of curiosity or laziness or false beliefs so considering the erratic behavior of present day humans who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild the fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact rather eat more wild sourced food just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food unless the environment from which it comes is polluted and that is a very real problem meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era the paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world now we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals beef will have some naturally occuring omega if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy this is no longer true the average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous you must choose your meat sources carefully meat made from free range animals raised on pesticide free in a caring manner can be very hard to find i found loren s rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded and in some cases irresponsible there is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture high fructose corn syrup trans fatty acids artifical sweeteners uncleaned foods raised non organically with pesticides and herbicides and improperly raised food animals my main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages about half of the book is dedicated to the spiel convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time i think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose after a while you get the feeling loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you and it really interferes with the flow of the book further a lot but not all of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet the claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine and peppered throughout the book but it s hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited one last nitpick one great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world it s a pity the recipes included do not explore those but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining i found the recipes far too traditional and western centric 
what a bummer i was on my way out of town and pick this book up on a whim as i breezed through a book store i love western romance but i had a hard time finishing this one i did nt realize it was a reissue and after checking other reveiws after i returned home i can see now why this rancher was such a demanding man i am glad times have changed ! anywaythis paperback was a waste of paper i didn t care for the way jason treated kate and i felt it was borderline abusive and kate just put up with it ! half of the book was spent describing what everyone was wearing do you really need to know what someone has on everytime they enter the room or when they light a cigarette the romance was hard to find in this novel at least the heart pounding kind i was looking for ! i will be more careful when i grab a diana palmer book in the future 
to the publisher of this book below everyone is entitled to their own opinion concerning what they read amazon com graciously allows these opinions to be viewed online the joke that concludes the first book is mocking and demeaning and was meant to be such ! the only believing found in this author s books are of her own theories and write off explanations however many aspects that the author uses to examine the parapsychology of the great city of chicago her conclusions are only within the closed minded framework of folklore and myth people who have had paranormal experiences in their lives do not share that view 
a disappointment what a disappointment ! boosting immunity is a collection of chapters by different authors that is poorly focused and lacks continuity there is nothing new in this book it is mostly a rehash of commonly available information and some of the chapters like chapter two read like they were copied out of an enclyclopedia the most attractive thing about this book is the title save your money 
for trophy wife want to be s i had completely forgotten about this book until a friend mentioned it the other day in her drunken st patties stupor this book is a great for read for normal people who want to laugh at really bad ideas to find a husband it s good advice if you want to be a trophy wife don t return a guy s call good way to date only losers who have no one else to call wear your hair in a pony tail learn to play tennis die your hair black get a nose job these are all pieces of advice in this book the idea is hide who you really are until you get married and then be yourself that marriage will last forever if forever is two days if you want to marry a rich guy who will ignore you and eventually trade you in for a younger version of yourself read this book if you want a good laugh read this book if you want real advice on men understading them finding mr right telling the good ones apart from the jerks knowing what they re thinking i recommend god is a woman dating disasters it s by a guy what s more he s a comedian and it s really funny with great and real advice 
another dorling kindersley children s book a good book to leave lying around in dentist s waiting rooms but if you actually want to concentrate on reading about shakespeare you ll need something much more grown up anyone with such a short attention span as this book imagines its readers to suffer from would have trouble getting to the end of a shakespeare sonnet never mind a whole play this book is all bright pictures and sound bites it s completely facile a series of short cuts to the aspects of shakespeare which for some reason people think high school students need they probably aren t the ones you want anyway 
boring boring boring how could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction i am actually listening to the audio version and i am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said i am going to stick to the movie versions of anne of green gables instead of reading the rest of the books at least the movies keep your interest 
waste of money i wish i had read maya s review sooner see earlier post i found this on the shelf of a wild oats grocery it was an impulse purchase because i needed a vegan cookbook in a hurry after deciding to go off meat and dairy for health reasons once i took the time to examine this book more closely i realized i had made a major mistake in trusting that wild oats would have a good vegan cookbook for sale i totally agree with maya saran she has very precisely described the problems with this book s tone and recipes i couldn t cook most of the recipes without a major shopping trip or a specialty order from an internet store i am so glad i saved my receipt this book is being returned as soon as possible ! 
utterly uncritical and duller than dishwater the problem with the book is that it s utterly uncritical of the entirety of stephen king s work it s simply a basic recounting of the novel s plot followed up with a few bits of trivia and the author s what i liked section the problem is that the author of this book likes everything about stephen king even when he s talking about king s weaker material you could write the words i love stephen king and everything he s ever done on an index card then post it next to the amazon search results for stephen king and you d have this book in a nutshell plus he refers to the gor novels as wildly popular uh no darren maclenna 
sadly this is a message that further divides the world i heard an interview with dr kushner on npr today he explained how the comfort in the rd psalm lies in the realization that for example god is not on the side of the terrorists or the hurricanes he is on our side why define the world as divided so in the first place terrorists are people too nature is people too until we accept the fact that god is in all of us we will continue to place things in good and evil bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world our comfort and relief from psalm will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we we not god or some divine law of the universe label as evil i rate the book stars instead of because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold full of compassion unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided 
too good to be true if something seems too good to be true it usually is that s the case with this book as well it seems that all of these authors in this book are continualy trying to sell each others products no real practical advice is given they suggest making money by building a huge mailing list and selling products to the reciepient through emails first of all how do we build this magical list and secondly who enjoys receiving spam of any kind these days let s call a spade a spade the only ones getting rich off this book are the authors 
outdated advice i m getting married again after years of being single amp was looking for relevant advice it was not to be found in this book it s a very traditional stodgy book for people who are afraid to break the rules there are better choices out there hint look for books with the word quotgrownupquot in the title 
too complicated i think this book may work for those who are really against letting their babies cry but i have to say if you are truly sleep deprived trying to remember all of the things you re supposed to do at am and am am etc is nearly impossible when i would wake up in the wee hours with my son i couldn t remember all of the methods she described and it wasn t like i could read the book right then ! if you are really committed to this type of method i would think it would work pretty well but in my completely exhausted state trying to remember several different steps to help my baby back to sleep made me more frustrated 
how did suskind get authorship credit on this book if you are looking for a fresh look at some of broadway s bomb do not stop here suskind wrote very little in this book of previously published material by other people this book is more accuratly compiled by than by him i refrain from entirely discounting this book because it publishes more or less in their entirety sources that were used by much better authors by their much better books it may be a reference for theatre students but there isn t much else to recommend this book and don t get me wrong flops are a source of morbid fascination for me this is why i am so disappointed with this particlar volume there s nothing in it that you can t get in other better written better compiled and better organized tomes 
good characters bad mystery i always like to give new authors a chance so i read quotwhen death comes stealing quot hoping for a good mystery what i got were characters that i liked a lot tamara and jamal but very little actual detection from a supposed private eye try marcia muller or sue grafton if you want good mystery and detection from a female writer i will probably not read another of wesley s books i love mysteries and mysteries without plot are no good 
not so good much is made of dyson s intellectual prowess this just goes to show you that all things are relative there are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson s intellect would one assumes seem impressive but that don t necessarily make it so you may at some point have heard the term pinhead the term signifies that the owner of such a head has a tiny little brain a quotpeabrainquot if you will this in a nutshell is dyson he meanders around offering weak commentary and observation that appeals chiefly to the mtv and bet crowd this is to say he offers nothing of value other than allowing penn to make their quota do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs 
blank pages and redundant material i received this book as a gift and i am so glad i did not buy it it is a page book of which over pages fifty pages are blank or have bad line art of a siamese cat the remaining pages are large type double spaced half of which are just rehashes of previous books i figure there are probably pages of original material it s obvious that ms braun or the publishers using a ghostwriter are just trying to milk the fan base for more money avoid this book even if you are a cat who completist 
better has been written i m going to catch flak for this if only because looking at others reviews i realized that this is the lowest the book has gotten this is mainly because the people who read it are a self selected group and so they like it unless they re from montana in which case they like it but call it too one dimensionalthe major problem with this book is that it takes a single theme and doesn t go anywhere with it there is no progression or movement in its somewhat flimsy premise to quote the opinion of a man i respect the book is in bits and pieces some of these bits and pieces are good others are just bits and pieces it feels all of her friends told her to write this book she wrote some bits showed them around had somebody read and like them and then a publisher gave her a check and said finish the book the insight provided by this book is debatable given that she approaches the reality of wyoming with a desire to reshape this in literary form to fit her notions of theme there is some good imagery there is also some wasted space some disjointed incompleteness and a sense that the book as thin as it is is itself wasting space by refusing to allow for more complex and varied explorations 
desperate housewives prequel i thought this was one of the worst books i ever attempted to read the whole plot is just plain ridiculous bored middle aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime when the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years such rubbish dont people see how contrived and unrealistic not to mention immoral this is avoid this one 
i threw this book away i seem to be in a minority here but i disliked this book so much i didn t even finish it it now resides at the bottom of my trash can dont get me wrong i m somewhat of a bornagain taoist the lao tzu saved my life and between that and thomas merton s the way of chuang tzu my entire life philosophy and outlook has shifted radically the hard part is conveying the reasons for my distaste of this book it may be because the only real redeeming parts are those directly copied from the lao and chuang tzu it may be because after reading merton s explaination of the three in the morning analogy i cannot agree with a c graham s translation both in feeling and in words far far too literal and intellectual taoism is for me about not trying to understand things but rather letting them be if you are a scholar and writing papers or such it might be good for you for the spiritual seeker if you need more taoist thought i would recommened reading different translations of the lao tzu or chuang tzu it s really all you need 
interesting but lacking this is a good book for someone who has never delved into the subject i find that it follows the same track as others in making the golden proportioning system fit about anything they want it to probably the most disappointing thing is the book s assembly there are numerous overlays in the book that are not aligned with the images they are overlaying the deviations are from slight to almost quot very bothersome to view this is more of a problem with mediocre quality control and concern by princeton architectural press it s good that the book is relatively inexpensive or i would have returned it 
bad language please away i ve studied in it major and my professor use this book as the main text for this subject even though i m not english usa but i read many text book before unlike the other texts this book is pure nightmare use very bad language and very hard to intrepret what the author try to communicate moreover the picture in the text represent nothing i get nothing from the figure and it s totally useless i try to find a group of people and let all of them help to translate the books surprisly most of them do not understand the text as well as i am and we cannot conclude what we can get from the book i ask the senior student who already pass the class i m studing all of them said that this is the worst text book that we had seen in thier real life hard to read no common fundamental word here author always use high level descriptive language expensive dull case study that hard to understand useless old not update lots of fussy comma will cause you headache etc finally i advise that you do not purchase this title and all title compose by these author unless you already did read it first 
horrible book this is the worst finance book i have ever seen for a book used for a mba finance course it is not very helpful at all if you are not a finance genius this book is definetly a no no the examples leave you clueless and the theory is very general dare to try and solve the unrealistic sample problems at the end of the chapters and a lot of the solutions in the solutions manual are wrong ! the professor who taught the finance class who has been in the field all his life and has a doctorate degree in finance admits this book is garbage and not appropriate for the mba beacuse of this we did not even use the book for his course this is a very expensive and huge book and so not worth the price i learned nothing 
pure pablum i have long been a dowd column reader along with a half dozen other opinion page writers and picked up this book at our local library there are many reasons why one writes a book you have a story to tell your editor publisher gives you an idea you want to keep your name before the public you need the money just to list a few i can t think that dowd needs the money unless she is being bribed because someone found out she is actually a conservative ! i also don t believe that she has the visceral need to keep her name before her public if she had a story to tell one would think that it would be told in a more convincing thoughtful manner since i am male and a grandparent i m guessing that i am not the target audience for this book and the positive reviews from several potential career women would seem to corraborate that they are the intended audience and herein lies one of my problems with ms dowd and this book it appears to have been written by a mid to late s woman surprised to find out that her options are running out not by the plus year old that she is ! those of you with year old mothers or aunts i ask you do they talk like this is this the kind of advice you would expect from them or has ms dowd at least emotionally stopped growing at about the same age as the ladies from sex in the city i expected a significantly more mature viewpoint from her i also quibble with several other points she attempts to make that hillary killed feminism well she didn t feminism is alive and well just ask my sisters wife and daughter some feminists lost their credibility attempting to defend bubba s actions with monica l moral relativism but what killed that part of feminism which was based on the supposed male belief that women were not their equals was its internal inconsistencies the same thing that doomed the ussr ! please try to tell my wife that men are her equal when she had been leading her family three brothers just like ms dowd since she was yes drugs and plastic surgery are a problem for folks with too much disposable income and too little to keep them out of trouble ! new york la and dc while fine cities all are not the entire us and what passes for currently acceptable behavour among the elite in those three cities just isn t on the average person s radar as earlier reviewers have said other writers have made the same arguments much better so i am left not having a reason why this book was written i am left with an hypothesis only that ms dowd is questioning decisions she made over the last three decades trade offs questionable choices etc and is wrestling with those not having yet come to a conclusion my data points are her lack of a response to monica l her acceptance of the job after her potential boss hits on her giving a bye to anita hill for somewhat similar behavour ditto hillary i wonder what those nun she had in school would say as commented in the book vis a vis elizabeth vargas removal from the evening news perhaps she doesn t have the gravitas to write a book or as helen gurley brown said of ms dowd s initial effort for cosmo pure pablum 
not my idea of a good time i found lewellen to be very wordy and dry i read the book for contemporary anthropological theory at my university and had to write a page paper on it i had to read the book twice in order to absorb any of it i have taken four years of anthropology classes and still find the book to be way above my head this is not a book to read for pleasure if not in the garbage it belongs in the classroom with extreme outlining of it for lewellen tends to be jumpy and almost scattered i would not recommend this book to anyone 
really stretching the truth is wastepaper really our most significant export this issue with dorgan s use of statistics was highlighted in a major newspaper this week and i feel compelled to share it with those who may not question the information the author uses to reach his conclusions the book s author in complaining about america s export situation complains thats right america s largest export by volume is now wastepaper mostly headed for china the hopefully obvious problem with this statement is that quantifying exports by volume is absurd in a day when economies rely far more significantly on the production of services and high value products such as computer chips a cubic yard of dell laptops clearly has far more value than a cubic yard of wastepaper the newspaper author went on to cite us trade statistics showing that on a dollar basis wastepaper is a comparatively insignificant though undeniably bulky export relying on information as flimsy as this one would be forced to conclude that the author is really stretching to find statistics to support his protectionist agenda overall the book needs to be read with a very critical eye and perhaps added to the next ship carrying the us s largest by volume export to china 
amazon lead review misleading amazon reports that of persons found a review by damian nash durango colorado to be useful the reviewer states i am also a scientist and know that most of my highly rational empirical colleages a quick google shows that reviewer to be a high school teacher this should give us pause when considering what stars mean given the current star glut in the reviews of the final theory to give only one of the egregious examples at amazon it may be time to put an evaluation i suggest a x scale on reviewers that scale should be applied on a peer review basis and not a popularity incidentanecdote basis reviewers who only submit star reviews would rate an automatic x until peer evaluated 
awful i am an eighth grader taking geometry so it is obviously advanced however this book is not helpful at all in learning it is so frustrating to not even have a glossary in the back to find definitions and the book does a very bad job of explaining tough concepts if you are a teacher please try a different book 
uninspired neither thoughtful nor thought provoking this book provides no meaningful information for adults nor for children what a disappointment 
boring this book is considerably boring it provided me information that i already know i definitely recommend this book to amateurs only ! 
dangerous book for orthodox christianity the above book was truly one of the first big people books i read about years ago this may surprise a few people but i always hated reading religion inspired me to read and read and read when i first picked up rescuing the bible from fundamentalism by bishop spong episcopal i thought this was going to be an interesting book indeed it was in the early days of my research for my faith i was moving out of a secularized and atheistic mindset so understandably i had a distaste for the rules and regulations of a church system like i grew up in that is the catholic church one of my best friends was or i should say still is a lesbian so how could i have reconciled the basic tenets of the christian faith with the lifestyle of my friend well as i read this book bishop spong actually gave the answer st paul writer of many of the new testament books was a homosexual albeit a celibate homosexual this seemed quite revolutionary to me indeed it still is but i later found out that many scholars have been using this as way to justify homosexuality after reading that book i honestly felt like it was the gospel truth i didn t stop to think about how much of the book really used very little scripture to justify his claims looking back on it father spong s argumentation was more like a psychoanalytic dissection of paul s behaviors which may or may not have signified what spong claimed for example does paul s admission of a sin which he is struggling with mean that he is homosexual perhaps but there is absolutely no basis for his assertions either from a proper exegesis of the text or the tradition of centuries of church history it s almost as absurd as the revelations of the da vinci code i would not recommend this book but i think a solidly formed christian can read it for a good laugh bishop spong has been a very controversial teacher and speaker for the last few decades he is certainly a contribution to the potential of an episcopal schism in america indeed in recent year over a hundred eposcopal priests have converted to roman catholicism and have take many of their flock with them let us stand proudly with the catholic church to say that there exists only one church as dr peter kreeft has said on many occasions which does not take it upon herself to edit god s word god bless laurence gonzaga 
all hype no substance clever marketing ploy calling this the last novel written by an author supposedly a passenger on oceanic flight portrayed in the abc series lost there are even lost references sprinkled throughout the book hanso mr cluck s john locke oceanic unfortunately it s the only clever aspect to this book it s a wholly sophomoric effort in the private dick genre pi paul artisan is hired by a rich man to find the man s identical twin the supposed bad twin of the title for a novel this short artisan spends an enormous amount of time thinking screamingly inappropriate thoughts about women he meets along the way some simply in passing including bedding the rich man s stepmother and a hippie yoga instructor named sky about half way through the story paul makes some high handed comment that he s not doing to the job just for money anymore this statement comes completely out of the blue i didn t find his thoughts or his actions backing this up the author has the annoying habit of repeatedly referring to the protagonist by his full name really not necessary since they re the first two words of the book paul has a mentor with whom he discusses the case a former college instructor named manny with whom he shares custody of an aging but young atheart labrador named argos manny has a knack for making his point by referring to classics like lord of the flies and king lear references which invariably paul never gets and manny has to explain frankly i would have rather read a book about the dog 
a big disapointment this book is a big disapointment the begining chapters have some useful information but much of it can easily be found on the web the franchises they list have no supporting information on why they re the best the information they provide seem like condensed versions of the franchisor s flyers 
just really bad writing ok i don t mean to be rude but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated it is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing here s my take i d enjoy a good end of times story this just isn t it the left behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success p t barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the american public and this series proves it christians should demand better writing from their revered authors go read some c s lewis or something please 
misguided attack mr horowitz has a valid thesis that classical music in the united states was taken over by commercial interests but he subverts that thesis in an attack misguided misinformed and mean spirited on a great conductor who tried to conduct music as it was written if it were not for the thesis this would get no stars 
not a page turner a friend recommended this book to me so i picked it up from the start i had to force myself to keep going i read the whole book but i wouldn t recommend it 
more disinformation good for fireplace more garbage that subtly steers the reader away from the idea that washington had no idea about the attacks and that they merely screwed up this book is for cowards that are afraid to look at the hundreds of glaring pieces of evidence that point to washington pre knowledge actually i think mossad did the dirty work i get sick of reading junk like this that serves to only mellow out and support insecure people that cling to the phoney american dream while they wave their stupid little flags that are made in red china the complicity of the american sheeple is beyond belief ! every body is willing to become a suck up like stalins yezhov or beria believing everything that is said to them then bang right in the head what will you sensible moderate sheeple say when the north american union and shafta steal your job and corporations steal your retirement another similiar piece of garbage that advances the innocent view of the cia and washington ise howard hunt s book american spy my secret history in the cia completely sanitized of any useful information if a book has any truth to it it will be either out of print extremely expensive or the author will have died of lead poisining gary webb gurudas david allen 
no more than a start joseph ellis is a learned competent revolutionary era historian while this book is a fine introduction to washington s role in the revolutionary war era and beyond it doesn t approach the caliber of david mccullough s john adams or edmund morris the rise of theodore roosevelt ellis seems to lack the sympathy and insight necessary for a good biography he doesn t seem to understand washington he doesn t get us into his head relying instead on historical narrative ellis also misses opportunities to bring out more of washington s character admittedly part of the problem of interpreting washington is that washington manipulated his public image acutely aware that it would endure to all generations the great w was scrupulous about his private life but rather than admitting this paucity of information and pointing to the gaps in our understanding ellis attempts to paper it over his prose style attempting conversation yet creaks with scholarly habit i bought this book relying on the stellar recommendations here on amazon but it seems i must wait for a great tour of the mind of this great leader 
disappointing i really loved the fall of a sparrow and greatly looked forward to another beautiful novel by the same author unfortunately this one fell apart about halfway through unlike the characters in the fall of a sparrow too many of the characters in this book didn t sound or feel like real people especially the grown up cory the girl who painted an obscenity on the appleton water tower was an intriguing character of few words seen mostly through the adoring eyes of the book s narrator the grown up woman just never took life on the page despite the many long conversations in which she took part the story of an american white boy s attraction to a black girl and his surely realated lifelong devotion to black music could have been a fascinating and far reaching one unfortunately this time the author fails to bring any satisfying insight to the subject 
bad theory worse practice dr moats theories have been excitedly received by politicians particularly those with very strong conservative views and slavishly followed by publishers these interests claim her work to be informed by scientific research and met by strong results sadly not only is dr moats classroom experience and research questionable she also fails to take any notice of linguistic theory most damagingly she is an adherent to the widely discredited theory of language deficit hypothesis this theory which was stunninngly debunked by labov in the s states simply that children who speak dialects other than standard american english lack a true language and require both remedial education and lots of phonics dr moats seems entirely unaware of this hypothesis thorough debunking since she never bothers to make any kind of argument as to why she believes it to be true this arrogance is problematic 
terrible mis representation of the baha i faith this book has several mentions of the baha i faith in it referring to the faith as quotan offshoot of islam quot and in one part quoting someone as making the baha is out to look like violent animals i will never read anything by this author again she may be aware of iran s history and politics but is very miseducated in the area of the baha i faith not bahaism as she writes it the baha is are quite the opposite of what this author believes 
an entire chapter missing this book is very good until just before the end there are too many things left unanswered at the end for example what was the exact relation between williams and one of the cousins when was the microphone placed in the office and by whom what was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy and many more ! 
was the author as drunk as the main character sure the plot lines are more than a little strange and i do not mean strange in a good way but has no one else noticed how unbelievably clumsy this book is i kept reading because one of the plot lines the more serious one with the bald fugitive dragged me along but it was doggone hard to deal with the style maybe i should say lack of style unless a surfeit of exclamation points counts as quotstylequot i ve read wambaugh s nonfiction in the past and i ve never found it to be particularly ineptly written maybe i stumbled on books he spent some time polishing i dunno but this book is a wreck there isn t a graceful descriptive sentence in it and the dialogue is almost unbearable even if it had been well written it would be pretty hard to enjoy a book where the dog is the only truly appealing character 
does unconscionable violence to the integrity of myth this book s author is one of an ilk that cannot abide to leave the stories of other religions than her own unscathed by her yen for monotheism the preface of the book rather than simply forwarding the myths in their entirety sets the stage for euhemerization of the norse stories to fit her own need for bland orthodoxy and the final myth of the book is hideously rendered to completely alter the cosmogeny of the norse pantheon again to suit her own weak religious predisposition this is akin to changing all of the old testament stories by say removing any references to rape and murder simply to white wash those books to suit modern enlightened sensibilities if an author proposed to write on the myths of still extant religious practices then the least that author can do is present them unedited and unsullied clear in their original form and intent this book s author is unable to see her way past her own religious indoctrinations and so ruins otherwise lovely stories with her poisoned pen a far better story book of the norse myths to be read for children is the children of odin by padraic colum and illustrated by willy pogany 
less than was led to believe by the other reviewers i love art and sf fantasy illustration and i am an admirer of lovecraft s writing skill and imagination the cover art on the book is great ! the interior work does not suffer for quaility so why the low review because i found the book itself disappointing it lacks inspiration i have seen most of the images online i don t doubt that many of the artist are fellow fans of lovecraftian lore and imagery but they as far as i know got paid to paint these illustrations for the coc card game hardly a paeon to the muses to be fair i was warned by several of the reviewers of what the contents amounted to it was the reviewers who were gushing about a book with a fair amount of mediocre art work that i could have paid less heed to if you are desperate for cthulhu related images get it if your merely curious let it pass 
dreadful i can t fathom why this book is beloved it s just awful alright that s a little strong the first third tohalf of the book is just awful tedious depressing tiresome plotless indeed lawrence put a sentence in that amazingly perfectly summarizes the first half of the book the days seemed to grind by with curious painfulness yet nothing happened that really does say it all the protagonist plods through her dreary depressing life and nothing happens at times during this book i got the feeling that lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story for a while i had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant i d never heard of until i finally just gave up eventually in the last third or so of the book it starts getting a little more interesting but sadly while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing in the end nothing very much comes of any of it but we do get long windy insufferably self righteous political nattering of a rousseau ian nature all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed in reality life in the state of nature is nasty brutish and short this is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in years unless we give up industrialism capitalism and all well the book came out in so he s still got some years to not look like an utter nincompoop but i could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good it is not the biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it this stems largely from the fact that lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people so much so that i strongly suspect that he was emotionally crippled himself every character is decidely neurotic each in their own special flavor the closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be mrs bolton the central character connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book but it sure takes her long enough i just could not identify with these people one tiny iota repeatedly i just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes to its credit the book does advocate an unabashed unashamed joyous love of sex something with which i am totally on board but that s about the only good thing i could find to say 
priests and padres a very narrow view of reality as an active duty chaplain in the military i had a significant interest in chapter priests and padres first i was amazed at the number of references and her ability to read organize and synthesize them into a narrative these references however are derived from a significant number of ministers writings or sermons which became the framework for her conclusions furthermore multiple references representing several wars are devoid of their cultural historical context and woven into one sentence or paragraph leaving the reader to think the behavior concept or issue is timeless and characteristic of clergy i don t consider the chapter a valid historical analysis because of the limitations of the source material what the chapter does provide is a summary of her sources convictions and behaviors which is not the whole story since i considered her conclusions in chapter highly subjective i did not read the rest of the book 
threw it away the good first there is a lot of good i enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal my husband and i have a great marriage he knows i have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me he is certainly not ever wanting more sex just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes in jest i m sure i say that to show that not coming from a prude the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it s normal i am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice it was dealt with like it s a fact so get used to it your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night the men give accounts of this like oh well doesn t mean i don t love my wife in my opinion just b c they aren t willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts doesn t mean it s ok i found the book to be very very discouraging that a bunch of married christian men would unapologetically key word here see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less were not talking lingerie here and think about what she s like in bed or what her nipples look like there s no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart or maybe they should not do this it really threw me for a loop ! i guess i didn t realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are not that i think they don t want a lot of it but i found it discouraging for christian wives to think that their husbands can t go to work without picturing everyone naked i found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it s normal and women just need to get used to the idea 
not worth the money even tho its cheap no isn t alot but mine would have been better spent on a magazine not good recycled material just a marketing strategy buy a real book instead tpr is always better than kaplan anyhow 
an unproven thesis the title appears to be a ripoff of pete hammil s book why sinatra matters a more accurate title to this book would be why new orleans matters to me almost all of the author s reasons are subjective he likes the mardi gras indians the neighborhood restaurants and music clubs so what what is the objective significance of them the author mentions but does not evaluate the objective effects of the high crime rate welfare dependence and the political corruption he also dodged the objective fact that before hurricane katrina of city residents could not read and write and refused to work does new orleans matter to him because a majority of its residents are stupid and lazy the truth is that new orleans has mattered for one objective reason its geographical location near the mouth of the mississippi river the u s cannot effectively compete in the global economy without a safe and secure new orleans if coastal erosion does not inundate the city it will continue to matter but this book will not 
i can t see a target audience lots of paper but not much information many things are scrated on the surface but not in a way you can really use something as an experienced developer on other plattforms javaix i wanted an overview of the os and the api s the book failed here totally i think i got usefull snippets of information from the first pages when i decided its a waste of time to go on and additionally some java examples are close to wrong the reflection example 
over it okay so i thought this book was supposed to be really great but when i read it it seemed very outdated almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago also i am so over ben franklin so he invented the kite and the can opener i think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway i was looking for some good witty sayings to use when i picked up this book until i turn next year i will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book as far as an almanac goes my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me in terms of up to date information i would like to recommend player haters by carl weber 
not in my kitchen not on my stove i fancy myself an expert reader but confess to barely emerging from my novitiate as a chef i m busy compiling a library of cookbooks to garnish my newly reacquired bachelor status and freshly cultivated culinary courage alas this particular tome is working its way to dust gathering status my most recent experience i attempted the piquant boneless chicken breast the recipe for which spans pages first of all the split breast at a medium high heat took far longer than the suggested minutes to cook so perhaps i thought the stove was not hot enough nevertheless i allowed some time for the pan to cool to medium before adding the garlic and cooking for seconds as indicated in the recipe although the chicken took longer to cook than suggested allowing me to believe the temperature too low the cooled pan burned the garlic and optional added tarragon almost instantly adding the chicken stock and lemon juice produced a scorched brown paste in the pan now i happen to love the taste of burnt garlic and tarragon and i count lifeless brown among my favorite colors so i quite enjoyed my dinner but i m glad the recipe produced but a single portion i would never have served this mess to guests ive now tried and taken notes on six of the recipes in this book all with similar experiences i d think the problem was my equipment and my incipient dotage were i having similar problems with recipes from other cookbooks alas such is not the case the joy of cooking pepin s books and the stuff the silver palate people put out all yield reliably splendid repasts i note the five star reviews that precede mine and marvel incredulously 
does not start the job well this book does not do a good job of getting the small experiments running and w o that it is difficult to get any handle over the big picture if you haven t done xml and oracle integration before this book definitely is not what you are looking for 
no so good don t buy this book i am studying calculus currently in my ap class i bought this book and i found out there are many misprints and errors there 
bought it based on review in saveur i bought this book based on a review in saveur it did not give me the information that i wanted and at i thought that it was very overpriced 
the wind in the willows this was probably one of my most favorite books when i was young i remember my mother reading it to me and how wonderfully mr grahame captured the countryside and the wonderful characters all memorable but now we come to this one a totally beautifully illustrated rendition it is though it really is hard in my mind to beat ernest h shepard s wonderful rat badger toad and all the reason for the star is two fold one it s an abridged version yes i know it s for consumption by younger folk i was however maybe or when it was first read to me why do we continue to sell our children short the biggest reason though for the poor rating is that several chapters have been left out the one i have always loved the best is the piper at the gates of dawn a beautiful tale of heroism compassion and love it s not in this edition an outrage ! i will not buy this book and i will certainly not recommend it to others 
not too good maybe it s because i didn t read avengers disassembled but i just didn t buy into the house of m and its story felt more like an elsewhere alternate reality non continuity story than anything else you won t miss much by passing on this one 
not one of irving s best i am a big john irving fan and have read almost all of his novels this book was a big disappointment for me though rather than deeply delve into the events and people who shaped his writing irving provides perfunctory descriptions of the major events in his life as a writer and wrestler he devotes much more attention to the scores of every wrestling match he ever took part in than to details regarding the process of crafting his novels for wrestling fans this book might be just what you are looking for for others i would skip it and re read garp 
the worst choice i bought it on aug th and it is already sept but i haven t received it i already requested for refund what a worst service you guys offer i won t buy it via your service again 
this will bore you to death im a regular reader of forbes magazine and theres nothing i love more then reading about inspirational stories of entrepreneurs businessmen tycoons etc so i picked up this book thinking its by forbes so it must have some great stories i also rely on amazon com reviews for my purchases so everything i say is from the bottom of my heart but im sorry you would not believe how boring this book actually turned out to be the writing style of daniel gross is well grossly boring unispirational unmoving and generally a waste of your money and time as far as im concerned this book will not inspire you it will not motivate you it wont even make you appreciate the great accomplishments of the very people it writes about it is a diservice to the personalities it talks about and is a diservice to forbes very disapointed im just hoping to flog it for whatever i can get finally i would advise anyone who is genuinely interested in the personalities this book writes about to do a google search and read about them from there because you will probably learn and appreciate more that way 
completely ignores phonology and completely unsuitable for a beginner this book and cd are a grave disappointment compared to the other teach yourself books i ve used although it introduces itself as suitable for the adult learner with no previous knowledge of german and studying on your own it s completely unsuited for that purpose since it fails to begin by teaching the basic sounds of german i actually know a bit of german at least enough to know that my pronunciation of ch needs work the book and cd give no help on this or on german s other phonemes which differ from english the first lesson starts using for instance ich with no warning or explanation much later there is some discussion of some points on which german s spelling conventions differ from english but this still largely assume you have already mastered german phonology and only need help with its orthography compare this with for example teach yourself esperanto s careful introduction to esperanto s vastly easier phonology and orthography and you ll see how far the publisher s standards have fallen presumably with the goal of looking easier by avoiding necessary discipline 
this is the most suckiest book i have ever read about algebra this book sucks it taught me nothing because of this boook i faild algebra do not buy this book 
who s looking out for the sexually harrassed glad i was able to borrow this rather than buy it his his show in a book by the way i have never seen such consistantly low ratings could it be that the majority of his fans can t read i have to believe this guy makes a few bucks between his show radio and books why does he have to fall to the level of hawking factor crap on his show even hannity is above that i gave him star above the default minimum for spelling and grammer for useful content 
not worth the money as is sometimes the case the title of this book is somewhat misleading having read several books which were generally favorable to greenspan i thought this one might give a balance counter view overall it turned out to quite a disappointment in the first few pages professor batra made it clear that he thinks he is probably more qualified to be the fed chairman than greenspan on page he says he had not done any path breaking work in economics at least not that was commonly cited on page he says it could explain how he had advanced so far without sufficient credentials how his extraordinary career appeared to derive crucially not from merit but from favoritism and connections also on page greenspan did not even have a ph d at the time nor had he penned anything pioneering to earn the recognition of his peers on page i again knew the book was in trouble when batra stated because in my view intelligence and integrity go together does anyone actually believe that all dishonest people are dumb on page batra made it clear that the book was as much or more about his economic philosophy than it was about greenspan when he wrote in fact i will offer a new economic paradigm to cure the global stagnation that has resulted from tax trade and monetary policies inspired by greenspan he does offer a paradigm unfortunately real world experience shows that the paradigm does not to work as he postulates clearly the book is attempting to put forth his agenda as the rest of the book demonstrates professor batra is a fairly strong liberal in whose world the working poor will spend all additional income and the idle rich will simply put extra income under their mattress he regularly harps on reducing income taxes on the poor and increasing them on the rich and big businesses as recently as the congressional budget office documented that the bottom to of the population pay little or no taxes while the upper income individuals and businesses pay the vast majority how the government could reduce the taxes on people who do not pay taxes is never addressed professor batra does correctly point out that the social security tax is quite regressive in order to discredit greenspan batra gives greenspan gives greenspan far more power than is warranted throughout the book batra tries to convince us that the president and congress did whatever greenspan might suggest or support as written the book makes one believe that batra never watched greenspan testify before congress where the congressmen tried to get greenspan to support their way of thinking basically batra tries to blame greenspan for all of the acts of congress batras new paradigm he calls economic democracy in this economic democracy the federal government would buy most of the stock of the large companies and then give it or sell it at a big discount to the employees of the companies that way the employees would be in control rather than the ceos and boards of directors clearly professor batra is not living in the real world in the real world most of the employees who were given the stock would simply sell it in fairly quick order and that of course would return things to where they originally were for many years i was an employee owner of the nations largest totally employee owned company and i can attest that they do not operate in any way close to what professor batra assumes the good professor needs to get out his ivory tower and get a job in the real world if you want to learn about greenspan this is not the book to read save your money 
not useful for day today calorie counting i bought this book so that i could easily figure my caloric and nutritional intake with a pocket sized book that would be easy to carry around unfortunately the lists in here are unwieldy and overloaded with burdonsome amounts of data on pre packaged foods why would i need this information from a book when it is listed on the package itself because of the pages and pages of info on frozen entrees and chain restaurant food it is difficult to impossible to find out say how many calories are in oz of sirloin steak i recommend instead lavon j dunne s nutrition almanac th ed it gives charts of basic foods and their nutritional content including vitamins and minerals in far more detail as well as a glycemic index chart chapters on nutrition and health without bombarding a person with the latest diet fads and charts on daily nutritional requirements plus it is fully indexed so you can look things up more easily the only plus i can give to the complete book of food counts is that is might be useful for people who eat out at chain restaurants since it has menus for some of them 
disappointing i was in the mood for quotchick lit quot when i picked this book up so was predisposed to enjoy it but although it had amusing moments i was fairly bored throughout none of the characters are really defined and the main character is derivative of far too many other books television shows and movies there are better quotbridget jones quot ripoffs out there 
thanks to this i ve memorized every truthful word that s come from your mouth how can one man be endowed with such knowledge how to cure every single disease known how do you do it what is the secret to your genius please the world is dying to know wait i think there s a cure for that on page 
no no no menstrual bleeding personal stories of abandonment and enlightenment blah blah blah a bunch of rubbish from aging people who were abused and now are better join a women s liberation group or a moon cycle clan for free but don t buy this uninformative and uncreative rubbish that has nothing to do with psychology or liberation 
the audio book of this title sent me to sleep first of all i want to make this clear that the two stars i give to this title has nothing to do with the content of the book it has everything to do with the author s reading of this book i bought the cd version of this book and found that the author s reading of the content of this book was not impressive at all he delivered the speech in a dragging and delibrately slow fashion his voice was tense and unnatural this gave me the feeling that he was not confident during the recording of this cd version in the studio i was greatly dissappointed with this cd version he did not deliver as i would expect from an expert negotiator i almost fall into a sleep mins into listening his cd ! i thought what happened to him he does not speak like respectable negotiator why would an negotiator speak in such a boring weak tone almost dragging every single words he speaks i wouldn t want to listen to a slow speaker he bores me to death ! i going to stop playing this cd ! believe me i am not exegerating i would advice you to buy his book save your money don t buy the cd version ! it s not worth it by contrast brian tracy is more competent in this area i have listened to brian tracy s audio book you won t regret buying any of his audio cd i can assure you ! his deliverance in the audio books is commendable he speaks with a clear voice not too fast not too slow very natural and this reveals his self confidence he does not only read from scripts he speaks from it 
end capital punishment then kill abolish all the lawyers quoth shakespeare and zemeckis ladies and gentlemen you do not need an book to tell you that capital punishment should be abolished because it is pretty obvious even to the layman there are maybe ten facts that make it necessary to abolish capital punishment and they include possible execution of the innocent more expensive than life imprisonment cruel and unusual means no deterrent to capital or even felony crimes death sentences based on ridiculous standards of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt drawn out lengthy legal fights that last years bogging down the justice system laws instituted due to political agendas and a legal system with absolute gridlock now i am in favor of a total moratorium on the death penalty for convicted felons since we cannot afford it in money or legal corruption the united states of america and the states must not execute the innocent no matter what the death penalty is not helping deter crime and the standard for conviction is laughable and undefined i am not advocating the death penalty for convicted felons but i believe shakespeare might have been right when he said in henry vi part ii through his character dick the butcher the first thing we do let s kill all the lawyers i believe capital punishment is targeting the victims or felons of the system when it should start targeting the ones who screwed it up in the first place lawyers are nothing more than mindless automatons of a system they are trapped in the second professors teach their minds to think of the law no turn their minds to a jelly state of tabla rosa so the lawyers are the major problem of a corrupt legal system and corrupt government maybe the capital punishment laws should be redirected towards them as shakespeare suggested in henry vi part ii there are others who have expressed this desire in literature fiction or film to rid the world or especially the usa of all lawyers how about award winning director and producer robert zemeckis and his writings in back to the future ii remember that robert zemeckis did not just direct back to the future ii he also wrote a great deal of dialogue for the characters along with writer bob gale thus it was zemeckis most likely or gale who wrote the line for character dr emmett brown in back to the future ii the justice system works swiftly in the future now that they ve abolished all lawyers i think that is hilarious and probably true like the futuristic writings of orwell h g wells and morgan robertson so if shakespeare and zemeckis have advocated it in fiction and these men are both geniuses why shouldn t it be instituted in reality i mean every problem in the us government or legal system in one way or another can be blamed on lawyers the proof is in law school education which does not take the dialectical materialist liberal arts education route of colleges and universities instead law school education can most likely be referred to as neo scholasticismwhere student s minds are crushed in an examination of pure minutia law students do not learn the law or how to apply it only penny ante sets of facts that avail them not in education or practice remember who has advocated the liberal arts system of dialectical materialism education their ranks include francisco petrarch karl marx and even frederick engels only catholic priests and educators of the dark and middle ages ever advocated scholasticism a study in pure minutia anyone who doubts law school education is anything but neo scholasticism go and find out the truth in law schools the true practice of law ended circa before lawyers were schooled equally in the classroom and in apprentice work under the tutelage of other working attorneys however in the us system of law and us law education shifted from a common law court of equity focus to an international law court of admiralty focus and look what happened the us government and us system of law has been totally corrupted by these lawyers a once perfected system of government and law created by jefferson and madison has now been obliterated unless we institute the inspiring plans of shakespeare or zemeckis it is quite possible that only the return of the lord can stop these corrupt and evil lawyers if only the lord s return can stop these lawyers then i say like john the revelator come quickly lord jesus these lawyers took a beautiful libertarian us system of government and law and destroyed it so i am inspired by coyne let us indeed end capital punishment for felons and focus on life imprisonment death of personality or alternate means for them instead focusing our efforts hopefully not capital on the lawyers to abolish all law school international court of admiralty lawyers in the usa then the usa would return to the common law system of liberal arts education in law schools or the apprentice system of learning the practice of law of course capital punishment should be abolished because it is the court of admiralty lawyers who set it up and corrupted it in the first place now you have a sue everyone legal environment where there are times the lawsuits there should be in the courts there are ridiculous lawsuits over everything now from property disputes slander libel looking at something the wrong way and lease contract disputes there are now lawsuits over anything and everything in all us courts most of these ridiculous lawsuits could have been resolved with alternate dispute resolution compromise or even honest communication it is not just the lawyers who should be blamed for the corruption and harm to a beautiful system of government and law in the usa obviously the politicians share a great deal of the blame but since percent of the bastards are lawyers already it is pretty obvious the lawyers are the most to blame owning at least percent of the blame the mean of and percent this book is part of the solution and that is excellent the problem is that the professor and man who wrote it is only part of the problem actually he is twice the problem since he is both a lawyer and law school educator the only way to save the united states of america from the corruption of international court admiralty lawyers is to follow the wise advice of william shakespeare and robert zemeckis professor you cannot reform a legal system that is already beyond saving and trapped in a legal paradox of its own creation 
you are kidding right this book proports to be a serious expose of a vast conspiracy involving the space program the landings and moonwalks that we watched worldwide were according to the authors faked on a very earthbound set to backup this claim they offer a vast array of evidence and theories about those involved and the reasons for this deception some examples are the evidencethe shadows on the photographs do not line up if there is only one light source as there would be on the moon the authors do not allow for the light reflecting off various surfaces or the fact that while the lunar surfaces are described as flat they are not completely flat small dips bumps and slopes exist and would effect the shadows the motivation the moon program was a means to take public attention from vietnam although elsewhere in the book the authors claim that this started during wwii or before the consipracy the conspirators according to the authors include all the astronauts nasa various members of the government department of defense the russian space program large portions of the british government and astromonical community movie technicians and author arthur c clarke to name only a few very little explanation is given to how all these people have been kept quiet all this time other clues to this conspiracy are present according to the authors in various press releases interviews movies and star trek episodes the authors present this evidence in a very unprofessional fashion they state their points embellished with many exclaimation points scatter about boxes with collaborating points decorated with cute little headlines this is made even more annoying when some of the points are well known bits of historical fact and the sideboxes contain illrelevancies like british nursery rhymes the authors find connections between the apollo program and the clandestine entrance of scientists from nazi germany roswell and other ufo incidents crop circles ley lines pyramids stonehenge intervention from aliens in the constuction of the solar system and many other unlikely events they identify relationships between many mathematical measures but do not take into consideration that many measurements are purely arbitary and by no means universal even among humans much less any other civilizations and therefore relationships involving miles hours days etc are only concidences and not clues to a higher truth by the time i reached the end of this book i was waiting for the authors to include atlantis free masons the knights templar and perhaps big foot this is to be read for entertainment purposes only the research involved here bears the same relationship to serious scholarship that jelly beans do to vegetables 
series hits a brick wall this is the third installment in the mitch rapp series and the author s fourth book overall id suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they re better reads mitch is america s go to guy when it comes to fighting terrorism in separation of power he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission someone tried to kill him the political infighting surrounding the naming of a new cia chief rogue mossad agents iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love one could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents ww iii not so mitch s romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well comedic the action threads of the plot which this author has worked so well in his previous books is hinted at in the first pages doesn t really begin until after pages and then proceeds in fits and starts there is an inordinate amount of character development self serving amoral scheming politicans our world weary battle scarred reluctant hero mitch who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do which like the romance impedes the plot the book hastily concludes pages in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author s previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and mitch s new situation doesn t guarantee that

meticulously researched but meticulously researched but dry as an official communique from the foreign office itself there s a great story within the panoply of names and facts here but dorril wastes no time with a striking narrative an unfortunate loss 
gary lost christianities ehrman s work is not for a person of faith it does not take faith into consideration it is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available most forged and falsified and none which can be validated i read it as an immediate follow up to his work lost scriptures books that did not make it into the new testament i was warned by my minister who is also a bible scholar and has two ph ds and my minister was correct in lost christianities ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the new testament by implying that many new testament books may be false forged translated incorrectly altered to serve a purpose etc ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the new testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the new testament ehrman s lost christianities starts out strong but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader if for nothing else it is an attempt to test your faith but in the end your faith will be strenghtened if you have faith the book leads one to believe that the author is as much a bible critic as he claims to be a scholar he does present all sides of the new testament story and it is interesting how the new testament was formed however the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does to save you the time and money simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the new testament and how came to be ehrman and other bible critics ie the devinci code seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the new testament story save your money and give it to your church instead gary 
not the best mouse book a mouse looses his family members then finds them it s just an ok book very underserving of all the star reviews a better mouse book would be if you give a mouse a cookie 
misleading and unscientific i picked this book from the shelf because the author s theory of health appealed to me i am a doctor and agree that modern medicine is not successful in many areas especially in prevention of diseases however this book left me disappointed the book is biased facts are not selected objectively but at author s convinience of course traditional chapter on doctorbashing totally distorted and presented one sidedlymany discussions are unscientific are patients with rheumatoid arthritis that are taking non steroidal drugs do worse because of these drugs or are they put on these drugs because their disease is more severe yes aspirin can cause bleeding but what about it reducing risk of heart attack benefit that outweighs the risk so that more lives are saved than lost yes unnecessary prescription of antibiotics is very bad but on the other hand many lives are being saved daily by giving these drugs to people i have a feeling that most anti allopathic references were taken from medical dissidents similar to those who claim that aids is not caused by the virus by the way are there really more people employed by aids industry than aids sufferers source claims from nobel laureate linus pauling about miracles of vitamin c were disproven in many scientificly conducted objective studies present opinion based on science claims that there are little benefits from taking high doses of this substance and its preventative properties are at best marginal still the author conveniently skips these facts in order to support his case and recommends this drug for prevention of colds by the way the placebo effect ascribed to medical treatments in the book is well recognized and accepted in allopathic medicine every clinical trial measures effects of new treatments against placebo yes many drugs help on the basis of placebo effect but so are numerous supplements from natural medicine in natural medicine in fact there are very few objectively conducted scientific studies on efficacy of health products and most natural drugs are given on the basis of anecdotal evidence i e vitamin c helped that guy to get rid of colds and vitamin e cured that woman of cancer etc my favourite is the editorial reference on the back cover where woman treated by ray francis returned to work making a six figure income does he have treatment for seven figure salary while thre are valid points in the book on health education and necessary emphasis on disease prevention in general it is biased opinionated and i agree with one of the previous reviewer the title is arrogant health and disease is very complex subject there is place and time for all modalities of prevention and treatment including naturopathic medicine however claims and opinions must be substantiated by scientific methods and not preferences and opinions 
christians be afraid be very afraid i gave this book star because i was so offended as a christiani have to admit i am an evangelical christian who had never heard of hugh hewitt until i found this book in the bin at a christian bookstore after reading it i truly wondered where the moral outrage of christians has gone this is pure machiavellian politics that has nothing to do with anything in christ s gospel sure there are moral absolutes but for christians to associate themselves with this kind of xenophobic racist and unscriptural totalitarianism is at the very least as much an affront to the cross of christ as anything in the gay agenda i am embarrassed and personally truly repentant that a book like this even carries the imprint of a christian publisher i would also like to apologize to anyone who might assume that this is a christian view of the world the jesus of the bible who is my savior and messiah does not fear either terrorists or multiculturists but gave his life for them only asking that they go and sin no more and make disciples of all men it is the whitewashed tombs of pharisaical hyporites that he condemns we can only pray that the kind of america hewitt envisions never comes about or if it does that we face the inquisition as good and faithful servants 
avoid this prudish edition resurrected from despite translating thousands of worthless latin quotations the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on love melancholy which burton waggishly wrote in latin untranslated burton demands enough of one s patience one shouldn t have to put up with this sort of nonsense from his editor even if one s latin is good after plodding through over a thousand pages the reader has earned a little titillating trivia also if you ve forgotten your latin burton s notes are left untranslated finally i ll say that although burton is amusing the book is too long with too little content go back to his sources read swift read marcus aurelius read kierkegaard on religious despair and then if you have time read burton or skim him 
surviving on the rumors of its sordid reputation i heard about this book growing up but didn t read it until just recently a middle aged adult and i have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written i e it was so shocking and disgusting ! such filth ! i mean that s why i heard about the book when i was growing up but as so many others have already pointed out it is tame by today s standards i also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the female protagonist is completely a male fantasy the book s message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man s part now you see what struck me about sir clifford s situation and lady chatterley s for that matter is if they really loved each other his paralysis from the waist down wouldn t have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms there are other things that can be done yes in fact quite possibly connie would have had an orgasm for the first time ! ahem women readers will know what i mean but clifford treated connie poorly with or without the lack of sex issue i think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway which to me just goes to show that a man wrote the book a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick 
too short too high level we own about of the dk eyewitness travel guides and have dogeared the pages over several trips they are amazingly useful but this one is not their best effort hawaii is a very diverse place and to try and hit the highlights in a travel guide is a mistake this book is right at pages but almost are about honolulu wakiki and oahu leaving only pages for all of the other islands even the pieces about oahu with little info about the west coast makaha and just a mattering on the north shore and honolulu with a few measly paragraphs on pearl harbor is scant as i said i love the dk eyewitness series it is the first travel book we get when going someplace new but for hawaii there are several other books more in depth if you are going to maui or the big island i suggest getting maui revealed or hawaii the big island revealed each pages pictures maps etc 
disappointing and dismal writing although the premise of the story is a good one the way it is handled literarily fell very short of expectations i kept wondering whether his editor was on vacation for allowing the contant ranting and philosophical tangents leaving absent the quotshowingquot that might have been more appropriate to a novel the story had interesting ideas to explore regarding holocaust victims and their children but doesn t bring any light to the ideas just a overblown ghost story which doesn t deal with the concept of quotgolemquot at all and instead virtually slanders a generation of disturbed writers despite the apology at the outset of the novel i finished it only because i had assigned it for my book group and was embarassed to have done so steer clear 
head in the clouds this is a fantastic book for those people who are slowly losing their grip on reality while some of the basic underlying concepts are good i don t find myself practically applying the concept of psychic prisons to my organisation nor do i view my staff as ameobas that make up a large organism i have to admit though that i know of others who found the paradyme of organisations as instruments of domination highly arousing 
ugh i loved girl s guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below i was so looking forward to another fun interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book unusual for me as i will stick with anything unless it s terrible this book is just so boring no spunk or humor it just fell flat i am also finding the jewish thing to be getting a bit old and overdone in novels these days arent there any other ethnic groups to be written about 
reads like a junior high history assignment i am an avid michael crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books crichton s writings are often full of action complexity character development as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society technology and human nature the great train robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements as i expressed in the title it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective the victorian criminal slang used although brilliantly to tell the story makes it a slow and at times unintelligible read i give it two stars because it is obvious that crichton has written a well thought out well researched book i only wish it didn t feel like i was reading his history report 
down on main street is it really my failure or theirs carol kennicott asks herself this question nearly pages into main street regarding her impossible relations with the residents of the town of gopher prairie minnesota by this time i was asking a similar question is it really my failure or sinclair lewis s main street seemed a good idea as it sat on my shelf touted as a satirical look at middle class america it was lewis s first successful novel ushering in a new era upon its publication in and breaking critical ground for the golden age of american literature of hemingway fitzgerald and faulkner lewis was the first american to win the nobel prize for literature how could i go wrong picking it up the book tells the interminable story of mrs kennicott who marries a country doctor while imagining herself an improving influence on his as yetunseen town of gopher prairie imagine her surprise when she is greeted not as a liberator but grist for the gossip mill with her big city ideas and lack of churchiness carols alternating turns of resistance and acceptance are about the sum total of this plotless book lewis s descriptive powers are much in evidence and you find yourself trapped in g p as much as carol his descriptions of noisy neighbors and smug dinner parties bearing the unmistakable imprint of someone who grew up in small town minnesota and knew of what he wrote the problem when you get past the period slang and the barbed commentary is that the subjects of lewis s satire are so miserable and nasty you can t understand why carol thinks she can change them except perhaps with the idea nature couldn t possibly create people as one dimensional as those found here i thought i d never read a duller work about small town americana from the early th century than thornton wilder s our town my apologies thornton main street is as down on the same locale that our town exults only lewis lays on derision with a dripping trowel wilder by contrast seems almost surgical in the delicacy with which he makes his points lewis makes sure that when he presents us with the atheistic radical miles bjornstam he is not only a voice of reason and affability to carol but ultimately run out of town for his beliefs on the heels of having suffered a great tragedy just in case we didn t otherwise get how miserable a town carol is stuck in and you want to reform people like that when dynamite is so cheap carol fumes early on there is one effective section in the book when carol first discovers how isolated she has become and feels the moist fleering eyes of prying neighbors so powerfully she draws down her window shades passages with her husband the stolid straying but not worthless dr kennicott present some desperately needed ambiguity but the book just keeps going hammering home the same points before winding down with an ending that feels more like a cop out in which the still radical but more placid carol settles for the status quo while imagining her sleeping infant daughter as a bomb to blow up smugness polemics can produce great writing but seldom great literature and main street is a case in point the signet classic edition from features an introduction by thomas mallon which was the most enjoyable part of the book candidly pointing out the book s faults but arguing for its continued value as it imagines carol s experience being like that of a young hillary rodham first arriving in little rock suffice to say i had a lot more fun reading it than i did the rest of this book 
much ado about not much captain alatriste is the first in a series and like a lot of series you re really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that unfortunately this is not the case with captain alatriste the problem is that there isn t enough of captain alatriste in captain alatriste it s told through his own sancho panza inigo his steady sidekick who has stories of his own to tell but those stories only distract from the main story which is paper thin to begin with throw in a lot of songs and poems and you ve got a sleepy reader 
poor text poor reference the only thing that comes through cleary in this book is the author s arrogance the reader will get a very good sense that lang understands the material but the reader will also get the sense that there must be a better book out there even as a reference this book is lacking the index is incomplete and many important concepts are either poorly defined or the relevant equivalent definitions are not given finally the order in which the material is presented is haphazard at best this is truly a text only for those with a ph d who work primarily in the field of algebra 
froud s work is terrific but book s quality is terrible i m a long time collector of froud and a wof member this book was purchased by my husband from my wish list i was delighted to receive it but was very disappointed in the quality of the edition a complete set of pages was missing and replaced with a duplicate set amazon s customer service always great to work with sent a replacement immediately but that book was also a a printing disaster all the graphics had inappropriate color bled into the images excessive blue yellow red definitely not acceptable in a book purchased not only for it s amusing text but particularly for it s artwork i returned it also as amazon could not guarantee me an edition without the printing errors as usual they issued a total refund thanks amazon 
cover blurbs do not accurately reflect contents of book this is a history of packaging not the psychology of packaging as i expected thus i found it entertaining in places and terribly boring in others if you are interested in packaging from its origins to its impact on the environment then this books does the trick if you are fascinated in pop culture then i would pass

drivel as a huge fan of chiefs stuart woods first novel i decided to give dark harbor a try what i found was a predictable plot gratuitous sex and all the marks of a spit out thinly plotted books machine stone barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family s life and left stone as the executor of his will when it is discovered that the cousin worked for the c ia stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work as they investigate and the suspects materialize the plot grows more and more predictable run from this one 
enough so annoying to be told again and again how the british treat dogs better than the locals and all the rest ! even complaining about the food he gets for free i would like one day to walk up to his house in scotland smelly and with a mangy dog and see what kind of food i get 
just plain bad david guterson weaves a tale of religious mystery in his novel our lady of the forest ann holmes a yearold runaway claims to have seen the virgin mary in the forest where she was picking mushrooms mary continues to appear to ann over the course of several days ann develops a following of people who hope to share in her visions eventually the catholic church becomes involved an investigator is sent to gather evidence of ann s visions and confirm or deny their validity is ann really see the mother of jesus or is she a disturbed girl clammoring for attention i read snow falling on cedars earlier this year and i really enjoyed the novel i decided i would check out guterson s other works thankfully i got this book from the library and didn t spend any actual money on it it was just bad the story moved so slowly that i was bored most of the time the characters weren t that compelling the narrative structure the same used in cedars did not work for this book at all i felt that i couldn t connect with the characters that i really didn t care what happened to them and the plot was very dull i wouldn t really recommend this novel definitely check it out from the library if you feel compelled to read it 
too much italy what about the rest grisham is one of my favorite authors however this one is not one of his bests ! we all understood that he loved bologna and the culture of italy it is a nice written travelogue but this is not what i want to get from a grisham novel what about the pace the adventure the chase and talking about the end could it be more simple those who are familiar with bologna or the italian culture or those willing to visit italy you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel try something else 
don t even bother with this one for all those people out there that are required to purchase this book for a class in undergraduate level psychology you had better get ready for a rough ride this book is an extremely difficult one to read it is very complex with deep concentrated reading necessary in order to comprehend half of what is being presented the flow of the book is extremely poor constatnly jumping around from one topic to another without any decent segues the case studies presented are extremely outdated and do not help much in understanding the topics being discussed they are not explained well enough to show the relevance of the case study and they are not tied into the discussion and used effectively at all this is a poorly constructed book that will frustrate more readers than it will help 
blach this is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message it should have been tiltled the jewish mother tree or something so the message was use me and use me and use me some more and after i m all used up use me some more and i will be happy thats something we want to convey to children 
no bill when will you just die if you read this feel free to email meevan fettgmailco 
i disagree we used a chapter from this book for my graduate philosophy of mind class to be fair i must note that i was not favorably disposed towards eliminative materialism to begin with nor any other materialism really my preference aside though i found at least this chapter to be rife with misunderstandings of other fields like ai and neuroscience even when you are generous to churchland s arguments they often turn out to not be arguments at all granted issues like materialism mentalism and dualism are difficult to find solid ground on what i object to is that he portrays as crystal clear arguments which aren t even logical even if you grant his premises are true which they often aren t obviously i can t give an in depth criticism here but i have a short paper on the topic anyways you may want to find a more complete and more careful text it succeeded in provoking thought but i was dissapointed in the quality of the author s thought 
souls of black folk was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free 
an excellent book but problems with the edition i purchased i ve read excerpts from this book before specifically the excellent judith butler essay however the edition of the book i purchased printed pages in place of pages while printing the same pages in sequence as well 
unendurable this book was on somebody s amazon com listmania for sea turtles so i hunted it down it is only vaguely about sea turtles in that it is set on an island in georgia where sea turtles nest there is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book and then he disappears so it s obvious that he was involved in the crime there are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable i wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and i ended up skimming the whole thing looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction skip this book and send your to a sea turtle hospital instead 
not the best fantasy novel ever i read this after reading karen hancock s christy award winning series legends of the guardian king and enjoyed it at first after reading the second book dragonquest i realized that these books were influencing me wrongly the wizardry is cloaked in christianity so it makes it seem ok at first but once i d read the second book i saw that where it was going was somewhere i didn t want to go i would recommend many other books before recommending this book 
avoid the book and movie no thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story the whole thing is based on who wants to kill darby and why and that is where it falls apart the fbi or cia could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could and what is the point of trying to kill her to bury what is already out in the open the fbi cia and white house all had a copy what are they trying to silence nothing at all perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
house of kolor advertisement overall the book didn t flow well for instance there were pictures on pages that the text didn t relate to it did have some good tips but it probable should have been titled how to paint with house of kolor than anything else it definitely would have been better if he had used generic materials instead of house of kolor this and house of kolor that 
pass the author s method of quotrevealingdeeper organizational characteristics quot is to arbitrarily circle arbitrary sets of notes assign them meaningless names like quotquot and make trivial assertions about the integers from zero to eleven 
liberal bias complete nonsense wow what lies i never hear any kind of news channel favor the left never the media especially fox news has a right wing bias its fact proven beyond any reasonable doubt the republican right wing nut job wackos invented the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage and its simply not true republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country all they know how to do is lie cheat steal and profit off of the suffering of others oh yeah and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe give me a break this book is lies i actually burned the book after i read it notice the lack of credible sources good job republicans continue to make up news the people are catching on ! 
unfortunately this one didn t work for me i must be getting old since i ve never done this sort of thing before but i was so frustrated after about pages of this book that i brought it back to the store expecting a solid historical novel set in the declining days of roman britain i found that it started off smartly enough lots of action tautly presented apparently essential in today s market if you want to see your stuff published but the tale just didn t catch fire told from the protagtonist publius varrus point of view the story sputters along as our hero leads an expedition into the british hinterlands to trade for iron becoming ever scarcer as the roman occupation winds down stops to slaughter some invading celts and burn their ship rushes back to sit by the fire with his superior caius britannicus of solid old roman stock and an old friend to decry the aging process etc then dallying gratuitously with the lascivious wife of another friend who finally kills her in a rage along with everyone else in his household and himself and listening to his own fine upstanding mate bemoan the moral deterioration in their little roman colony as a harbinger of terrible things to come ! all in the first pages or so i couldn t take much more of it and shut the book rushing it back to the store to reclaim my cash haven t given up on historical novels but this one clearly didn t work for me perhaps i am just growing less patient as my own aging process sets in still many others here liked the book so perhaps i just didn t stay with it long enough to give it a fair chance the truth is my eyes aren t what they used to be so i don t want to waste them reading things which don t take off in some fashion for me and this one just didn t sw 
good book bad reading unfortunately some audio books are read in monotone very dull indeed but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it s story time and she s a preschool teacher my daughters and i loved the main characters in audio books such as bridget jones diary the nanny diaries and sammy s hill because the reader made us sympathize with them we knew that whatever the characters did they did with sincerity and whatever happened to them could happen to anyone emily gray the reader of can you keep a secret made the main character sound witless and very very phony all of the other characters sounded one dimensional we listen to audio books on our frequent long car trips although we had nothing else to listen to at the time we could only stand  of this book before we had to turn it off a few weeks later i randomly read a few chapters of can you keep a secret in a bookstore and thought that it was amusing perhaps emily gray didn t find the book amusing so she thought that she needed to go over the top to add humor if so it didn t work she took a lighthearted enjoyable book and turned it into the equivalent of listening to nails on a blackboard 
good on process low on recipe s the book covers the process of smoking well good information on brining sausage making and processing smoked foods is provided it lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats a few recipes are presented but this is not a cookbook 
very weak entry in the series like many others i m a big fan of the ladies no detective agency series but this is a really poor entry that barely even bothers to go through the motions first of all mma ramotswe has only one case to deal with a wealthy woman who wants her four suitors checked out to eliminate any golddiggers the first two she checks out are interesting enough a bible thumper seeking to reform bar girls and a slick radio dj but smith doesn t even get around to the other two and wraps up that storyline in a very abrupt way another plotline revolves around mr j lb matakoni and a dishonest competitor garage but this is small potatoes that doesn t really amount to much a third plotline involves mr j lb matakoni s getting dragooned into a parachute jump to raise money for the orphanage again doesn t amount to much the last major plotline concerns the marriage between mma ramotswe and mr j lb matakoni or rather the lack thereof the resolution to this is completely anti climatic and doesn t do justice to the event one might forgive the weak plotting if there was some really juicy character development but there isn t even worse some major characters almost totally disappear mma makutsi has very little role and the two orphan children adopted by mr j lb matakoni appear only once or twice the book s got the same warmth and humor as the rest of the series but it s all sort of perfunctory one doesn t get nearly the same feel for the country and people the overall is like looking forward to a weekend visit with old friends only to find them totally distracted and distant big bummer of a book 
special topics in calamity physics this seemed very pretentious with an unnecessary amount of literary references it was convoluted and felt like wading through mud difficult to get through 
boring what a waste of time this book is good for one thing it reminded of something i need to work on my stubbornness sometimes i can be just too stubborn for my own good when i was reading this i just wouldn t quit and had to go all the way to the end this will teach me thank you mr baldacci here is a synopsis of the book a is the biggest strongest man in the world no way ! b is the biggest strongest how can they be if c was in the most awesome group of men in the world then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest strongest and smartest of them all thank you again david this would have received a star except i was reminded of the lesson i needed 
if you ve read gtd you can probably skip ready for anything key points one should read allen s getting things done gtd before reading ready for anything rfa if you ve read gtd you can probably skip rfa it reinforces some core gtd principles often in a mind numbingly repetitive fashion which can be a good teaching style but also tries to fill in some of the vision thing content absent in gtd unfortunately covey is better than allen in addressing the vision thing together gtd plus covey s habits and first things first ftf make an interesting collection rfa suffers from the same design and layout issues i found with gtd the inspirational quotations in the margins destroy the reading flow as they push into the space occupied by the main text the quotes distract the reader from the main text due to their intrusion into such and a lack of white space imo there are too many inspirational quotes allen should have simply started each chapter with one relevant quote ala covey s habits i ve noticed that some of the inspirational quotes are recycled from gtd and are sometimes better than the associated essay in rfa to see how to place quotes or references in the margins of a book s pages allen should review any of edward tufte s books such as beautiful evidence there are obvious parallels throughout rfa to ideas in covey s habits and first things first however there s no mention of covey in the book and he s only cited once in gtd via an inspirational quote both covey and allen have interesting things to teach but it seems allen eschews any reference to covey despite the obvious parallels to anyone who has read both authors in some cases it seems allen is taking pot shots at covey ideas such as his reference to the quadrant matrix on page of the paperback edition of rfa an obvious reference to covey s urgent important matrix in ftf rfa makes no attempt to indicate when the included essays were originally published in allen s newsletter it would be interesting to know when the original essay was published i m sure they ve been edited and updated for the book but some connection to their stated original publication dates might be helpful in understanding where allen was in his personal journey at the time he wrote the essay the by the way items at the end of each rfa chapter may be valuable for readers who ve not yet asked themselves some of the deeper questions or who are struggling with their gtd implementation imo the gtd workflow chart in a revised form in rfa still needs work perhaps they should not try to fit it on one page use a two page spread or even better a fold out that one can also tear out the chart would benefit from the help of someone who knows how to draw flowcharts the paper in the paperback edition of rfa is of a cheap inferior quality compared to that used in the paperback edition of gtd to me it feels like cheap newsprint rfa lacks an index a book like this without an index is most unfortunate indicating perhaps a rush job to capitalize on gtd interest by recycling old essays recycling content for additional profit is a good idea but any book like this should include an index 
the glorious cause is glorious this is one of the best books i have ever read on the revolutionary war even though it is technically classified as a novel it is accurately presented history mr shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book and presented the historical events accurately as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable the main participants in the revolutionary war were presented not as gods but as truly great and courageous men and women he also presented the details of battles troop movements condition of troops and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events i have a better understanding of the revolutionary war years than i have ever had and would highly recommend this book to every american who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country 
first in a series has anyone recently pointed out that teddy kennedy s dog is named splash maybe they should make this a series of books bill clinton can be featured in the next edition with his dog named i rape women just an idea and who s the artist was he working with photos of ted from ted hasn t looked that svelte since the sixties where s the neckbrace 
abridged while it doesn t indicate it this is a heavily abridged version of the story and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the film it s still a good story but gets stars for not indicating that it s abridged and because even at pages the full unedited story by dumas is much richer and makes for a much more satisfying story do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for of the story 
agree with father a giant step backwards this wonderful insighfull dad mentioned women in afghanastanprogressing well actually in the future they will probablyprogress way beyond american women since they aren t held downwith the all too common american strerotypes of girls beingmathematically and mechanically inept gurians restraint ofwomen goes far beyond burkas and delves into the dangerousarea of a limited intellect the girls in this country will grow up with burkas on the brain which will destroy their spirit toachieve and fully grow as beings after reading this horriblebook i can only think gurian has fear of women getting anywherein society beyond a second class citizen gurian has obviouslynone his damage already since so many people already believeevery word he writes as though it came down from the skyengraved in a gold tablet i found myself furious with him after i read the book i only hope people wake up to see what amanipulative sexist monster he is 
outdated and jaded this book is a nice overview of various options available to those having difficulty conceiving unfortunately this field changes quickly and since it s publication it s very outdated techniques she discusses are now rarely used because newer more effective treatments have been established also her slant against fertility treatments as she admits in the preface is obvious throughout the book finally the author s understanding of research appears limited specifically she fails to consider that ivf pregnancies are not at higher risk of miscarriage maternal age is the risk factor it just so happens that those who receive ivf treatments are generally older 
simplistic advice the advice given in this book is really so banal that i suppose anyone could have written the book i really don t understand why there has been so much attention given to the concept of emotional intelligence seems to me that normal folks are according to the description of the authors emotionally intelligent no need to write books about something that s so obvious is it maybe written for those you lack the real intelligence 
very dissapointed i wasn t expecting this book to somehow transform my sex life but i certainly didn t expect the garbage i read yes he makes some preaty good but obvious observations for example when a man looks at another woman he needs to look appropriately or that a woman like to hear she s beautiful this is definitely a man writing to an audince of women there is some good advice here but you have to be able to distinguish it from the nonsense 
good until page i read the subjection of women for my th century philosophy class i found it interesting but hard to read mill tends to be repetative and wordy he is very much the early feminist until you get to page or when he tells you that for all women can do they should stay home and care for the family anyway i would suggest that others read this book but give yourself time because about pages a night was all that i could muster at pages it s not too long but could have been said with more clarity and organization 
two stars because of its legacy i mean after all this is the ironman series we re talking about but for content avoid this rather do yourself a favor and pick up franco columbo s book it is far far superior and will give you much better results and much superior advice however all the other ironman books with the exception of the natural bodybuilding book should be picked up 
disappointed you would think by now i would have learned not to judge a book by its cover but that s exactly what i did in this case the picture on the front cover is charming the words fresh engaging and authentically british from a booklist reviewer are splashed on the cover and that reeled me in if you like the cozy mystery genre and are a fan of agatha christie anne perry dianne day rita mae brown or margaret miles this may not be the book for you if you liked the s tv show roseanne you re in for a treat she s back this time as a british house cleaner named lois ann purser goes out of her way to make lois unsympathetic and her husband derek and daughter josie downright annoying and unlikeable it seems as though purser s trying to break down the stereotype of the british mystery by choosing working class characters in modern times which i completely respect but she s building up another stereotype at the same time that working class people are brash crass and argumentative aside from unsympathetic and sometimes annoying characters the conclusion of this mystery is a bit far fetched and leaves a lot of questions unanswered the sad thing is i m not even all that curious about having them answered a very unsatifying read 
mediocre i read this book it was okay but the story flashed back to much and i couldn t folow all of it but i read all of it anyway i wouldn t recommend it too slow moving and boring because of the flashbacks the movie was the same way 
confusing but amusing my yr old laughs but i don t think it s bc the airplane is inside the airport this rs i would not buy along w the bedtime stories one the ultimate richard scarry is the splish splash sounds book please and thank you is really good too there s some rs author controversy out there something about the books not all being truly written by the rs author 
poorly organized mr das aka jeff seems to enjoy dragging the reader through as much suffering as he can recall that appears to be his main point the text is scattered with no logical order frank hazelwood 
probably my last elaine flinn book i too really enjoyed the first two books in this series and was saving this installment as one i was sure to love but i had to skim the last or so pages because i knew how it was going to turn out and the dialog wasn t fun or enjoyable to me it may be true that randall and emma are true to life but they re just not people i wanted to spend anymore time with it s too often that teasing is confused with bulling and i think that randal in particular was abusive and domineering towards the end with the excuse of he s the cop so it s ok authority figures are tough to portray well but authors can write characters as roll models when there are those ideal authority figures children can be children and that s very dimensional and rich for randal to be the love interest and not be nice to molly is just un excusable and for emma to be un parented and friend to molly is un healthy 
voodoo physics gary zukav states in his introduction i had never studied physics in fact i didn t like science and i had no mathematical aptitude on opra tv he admitted that he does not have a tv which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth i noticed that some reviewers refer to the new physics is that like new age or voodoo physics of the matter must be missing from this book or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of he even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose many people say they did not understand physics until this book surprises you still do not you now know what zukav wished physics was take anti mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater and the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats at least get it straight before mixing it up try reading some of these the ascent of man by jacob bronowski the book available everywhere the dvd s available from the uk the upanishads by eknath easwaran editor michael n nagler photographeror just about any mainstream material on physics and religion then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner the tao of physics an exploration of the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism by fritjof capra also on the fringe but not as radical as zukav is a series called what the bleep both in books and on video 
not so good i was enthusiastic about this book when i first scanned it at the bookstore later after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it i found it to be mediocre 
it bites the big croque horrid just horrid 
nice idea but poorly executed while it is interesting to imagine what a great composer would think of the modern day i have to say that this attempt fell short much of schubert s character seems cartoony and under developed while many of his activites are true to form the manner in which they are portrayed undermines the real man granted it is incredibly difficult to give this character a life especially without dialogue however marson s lack of understanding of music of any kind handicaps the novel beyond repair the story suffers from dead wieght and that is given in exchange for more meaningful development i know that many people enjoyed the book but i did not i suppose that as a musician i am more critical than other readers i do seriously doubt the long term quality of this book and i suspect in years it will be forgotten 
that s it ms steel is truly the queen of repition she needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor i see that is the ongoing critism of her books i swore i was never going to read another of her soaps i can t stand those either but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good i ll stick with the authours i know i like from now on and i hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite exquisitely she has worn these out but she s laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
lame this book is full of useless ideas good ideas yes but common sense not worth the money 
it all depends it all depends on who you are if you will like this book republicans will like it but democrats or people with brains won t 
i want my money back i m really surprised the authors became so famous as the new gurus of crm or to marketing this book is just a collection of superficial case studies but it says nothing on the technologies used the real problems companies had to face when they implemented crm programs this is just a book for high school kids or sunday newspaper readers who want know more about crm without getting into the details not worth the money and absolutely simplistic 
regret ever read a newspaper article to find half of it is taken up by useless information e g quotdr kenith e browner mba bas winner of the soandso award local environmentalist graduated from northern ss university with honors says to bundle up this weekend quot you just can t help to skim past it all which brings me to death valley by keith william nolan half of this book is filled with useless info ! once in a while you get a little hint of a story but then it jumps back into naming so many battalions sergeants lieutenants soldiers weapons equipment points etc you just can t visualize anything happening with all of this well i don t know what it is one thing i m sure of is that i totally regret setting eyes on this boo 
ranges from distortion to outright falsehood shahak was a chemistry professor better known for his racist anti jewish diatribes his allegations range from the outright distorted to the flat out fictional one example is the often used slander that the talmud allows relations with minors actually it is a sin and a crime under jewish law it is rape there is a discussion that does not ask whether it is allowed but whether the victim of this rape is considered a nonvirgin when they grow up and seek to marry in a culture where virginity is considered important for marriage the victim may become a double victim victimized by the rapist and again by society being labelled a nonvirgin the final answer is that they are considered a virgin when it comes time to get married however this discussion that it is as nothing is taken out of context as if it allowed rape shahak also makes many bizarre and patently false allegations such as his claim that jews and israelis dont use signs in addition because they are little crosses and that observant jewish ritual involves desecrating christian graves if many readers who don t know much about judaism find it an eye opener there is good reason shahak is making this stuff up if you want to know what judaism really says or jewish law the talmud really says find out for yourself go to your local orthodox synagogue and ask for lessons or go to a free class heck pretend you re jewish and see what we really think and say and you can also check out http wwwgeocitiescomathenscyprushttpwwwangelfirecommttalmud 
bs pure ruminations i can hardly find words to describe this work vacuous comes to mind with little effort the entire time i read this i thought where s the research save yourself a buck think different like richard branson 
keegan strays from his usual standards of excellence in attempting to tackle intelligence in war intelligence in warfare is a simplistic arguably inaccurate and often times pompous attempt by noted british historian john keegan s personal theory that intelligence operations play little part in warfare as a whole some have argued that this book is about how intelligence in but one piece of leadership but keegan s arguments refute this rather than support it to keegan intelligence is sometimes crucial sometimes not and most of the time just a minor part of a whole if that is the case then why write this book at numerous times in each case study keegan observes that the outcome would have been different had the intelligence gathered been acted upon rather than cast aside a chapter later he will complain that the intelligence should have been cast aside and that basing decisions on faulty inteligence caused the defeat he essentially contradicts himself chapter by chapter you can t have it both ways though his writing is fluid and poetic as always keegan makes the age of sail come alive better than anyone this book is a prime case of staying in your lane of expertise intelligence is merely one part of the battle and rarely tilts the decision one way or another the challenge of intelligence is recognizing the value of specific bits of information in a sea of speculation in this case there are many other books out there on the topic that are worth the expense 
journalistic propaganda this book was nothing short of journalistic propaganda indeed goebbels himself would be proud of mr krakauer with this little number under the banner of heaven to read through this was like suffering chinese water torture there are many gross misrepresentations that mr krakauer puts into this biased and unscrupulous piece of propaganda and an equally greater number of flawed conclusions based on things taken grossly out of context but before i go into those i should mention that mr krakauer is a self defined atheist who has had struggles in believing in god and i should mention that in case the reader did not already know mr krakauer himself admitted that he had an agenda in writing this that is to prove that the lds church and it s founder joseph smith are sex crazed zealots who have murdered many people in the name of god now lets see how mr krakauer to no surprise fails to prove or even indicate this in this book mr krakauer claims that the lds church has always been violent because of the activities of the danites and because of the mountain meadows massacre well show me mr krakauer a religion that has not had it s share of fundamentalists that have acted inhumanly in the name of god or better yet show me how science has never been used to justify the discrimination and murder of people have you ever heard of dr death or josef mengele who used science to justify his cruel human experiments on of jews in auschwitz have you heard of hitler s euthanasia program which killed thousands of mentally handicapped persons have you ever heard of the racial science used in the late s and early s to justify scientific racism thought so mr krakauer you are throwing the baby out with the bath water just because a few men used their religion to justify their personal displacement and murder of others does not mean that the religion that they adhere to is evil it simply means that those individuals misused and skewed an inherently good faith for evil purposes you seem to be obsessed with damning joseph smith as a sex animal because he had multiple wives this is very childish and i would advise you to take a look at yourself in the mirror because only those with sex constantly on their own mind would do what you and several others are doing and accusing joseph smith of doing mormon plural marriage was not just for sex it was not because joseph smith remained perpetually and hopelessly smitten by the comeliest female members of the flock as you so deviously said plural marriage was a very personal matter that created many loving relationships and family bonds you sir are no better than the common slanderer who needs to throw a few slugs at a man who you are obviously intimidated by countless scholars and historians have all agreed that plural marriage was a religious and social concern and not just for sex while we are on joseph smith do you realize that the brand of magic he did indeed practice as a youth was called folk magic or white magic it was not the satanic black magic that you claim joseph smith so passionately practiced the folk magic that he practiced is no different than if today he were to have a rabbits foot or a ying yang medallion it was the popular brand of folk tradition that even respected ministers and pastors were reported to have practiced where you fail as a journalist you fall flat as an historian better get your facts straight and make sure what you are talking about if you are going to write a history of a violent faith for example there are four books of scripture not three that lds church members consider cannon and i hardly consider the dogberry papers a reliable source to quote from which you seem to have no problem doing in short this book was nothing more than a piece of journalistic propaganda that would be welcomed with open arms in nazi germany it is lopsided skewed biased bigoted and severely flawed and our atheist writer is in the same camp as those who think that all germans are nazis all russians are communists all japanese are buck toothed fanatics all arabs are terrorists and all catholic priests are child molesters go back to writing about nature mr krakauer because history is far more complicated and does not need idiots such as yourself to muck it up more than it already has been ps i hated into thin air as well 
worst airline is still the worst the book may provide a business model but the airline has not come back continental is still the worst run airline in the u s so the entire premise of the book is moot 
a poorly organized book about a fascinating topic psychology and alchemy has a lot of interesting information but it is not presented in any sort of organized fashion alchemy is well known for its perplexing symbols but in the book these symbols are only referred to in passing this book is not for anyone who is trying to understand how the symbolism of alchemy relates to psychology the descriptions of basic elements such as the planets the caduceus or birds are only sentences in length and are scattered throughout the book trying to use the index won t help either as the pages listed in the index as containing information about a topic are often incorrect as they contain no mention of the topic being looked up 
naive simplistic and general mr dietrich whatever his academic credentials joins the ranks of many a china scholar that so romantasizes china that careful research and balance are rejected this book is so hopelessly simplistic and over generalized that its almost useless documentation is almost non existent and his analysis of the events of modern china are reduced to a th grade level with scant detail and almost no evidence the quotachievementsquot of the communists in china are very romanticized and if one wishes to really understand the last years of china s history this book is not the way save your money 
pull ease i m with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending i m all for twists but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb the book tells the tale of hamptons small time lawyer tom who had a brief career as a professional ball player apparently sometime in his youth he dumped the woman he truly loved kate who became a hard career lawyer in nyc we know she s hard because she smokes and has no friends but in the end they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death penalty charge its twisting and turning and super derivative but mostly it s satisfying until the last few chapters when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke i felt as if the entire reading experience was false and a waste of time badly done cheap pattersons books may not be the best but they ususally don t make you feel this cheated 
survivor in death the beginning of this book was excellent but dont be fooled the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers what s the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were this was one of the worst books i have ever read i d call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery dont waste your time reading it 
forget trying to order this from amazon i have been trying to order this from amazon since october twice now they have delayed and delayed the delivery for months only to finally cancel the order they clearly do not have access to this book 
is he kidding i m hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews didn t actually stoop so low as to buy the book i read a few pages of it and this is truly th th grade level writing i didn t realize that bill s narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was interesting rather than just blatantly one sided and sickeningly arrogant bill should stick to repetitive i know better conservative babble it gives us liberals radicalsfreethinkers something to make fun of 
boring this story has been done time and time again don t waste your money humor was forced and trite book was way too long 
a highly agrivating pile of schlock frustrated authors take note you can be published and you don t even have to worry about little details such as punctuation sentence clarity story structure or grammar cormac mccarthy proves it eloquently with all the pretty horses had mccarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher who was either drunk or high or both who thought what the hell let s print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it i m sure people will buy it after all americans don t care about grammar anyway im not going to dive into the plot of the story you can read it above this book falls short of one of the best in literature how they compare this guy to faulkner is beyond me the comparrison is an insult to faulkner and people who read books in general most fifth graders can write better more enthralling naratives 
doesn t deliver what it promises the back cover claims the text quotprovides everything you need to know to set up and manage an ethernet network quot more like everything you don t need to know and little practical information on how to set up a network the author takes an encyclopedic and general approach definitely not a how to book perhaps it provides useful background information for network administrators but little help for setting up a small network would more honestly be titled quotethernet the encyclopedic background of standards and options quot 
boring sorry just plain old boring ! don t get this book 
how sad i think i ve read most of mr woods stone barrington novels enjoying them thoroughly but this is a sad addition to the collection he just called this one in unrealistic plot unresolved plotlines bad dialogue i think he s unfortunately succumbed to the publishers lament you just have to release another stone novel this year there s no pride of authorship in this book it s strictly a throwaway and the circular bin is where it s ended up 
scattered superficial treatment the book is trying to do too much but end up delivering little there is also not enough code to illustrate the concepts i would recommend matt buckland s ai books if you are actually looking for a practical guide to help you develop your own ai system if you must buy check it in the bookstore before you do 
overrated i have read both of hyland s novel and i find her to be completely overrated she uses the same voice for the main protagonists in both books one is a sixteen year old girl and the other is an eleven year old boy the fact that their voices are indistinguishable points to her weakness as a writer at least this book had a plot unlike her last one hyland is constantly touted as a writer to watch but i really can t see what all the fuss is about 
pass on it catchy title but you d do better without it the only thing hidden in this book is the information try finding for instance the garden of the gods using this book you ll be hopelessly lost and lucky to find your way back to the hotel same for several of the beaches waterfalls and so forth one has to wonder whether the author actually visited the places he s written about or just looked them up in other books there are some good guidebooks for hawaii out there but unhappily this is not one of them i d pass on it 
she s not the author i fell in love with in i really liked boyd s first book smart passionate opinionated and well pacedsince then the bar has certainly been raised on ts lit chris beam s transparent is the new cool and alas boyd has lost her edge most of this book reflects boyd s time on the seminar and publicity circuit it s much more circumspect and diplomatic than my husband betty no more dissing tri ess for example and that s a shame because boyd was at her best when she built up some heat also a lot of this book reads as if her lectures have been compiled then padded to book length there s a lot of lazy writing cliches like kings ransom necessity is the mother of invention love is a many gendered thing and so forth everywhere sigh i was really looking forward to this but it s a flat read betty does look ravishing on the cover though 
go see austin powers instead ok this is not a recommended title but i couldn t resistsaying a few words about it here because of its high entertainmentvalue for years now i have consulted for us companies entering the japanese market so naturally i paid close attention to the chapters on japan they were very entertaining they read like the script from a mr bad guy in a movie check out the prose too quota japanese samurai worker produces in one day what it takes an american worker two days to produce to the western world the japanese stress the importance of free trade because they know that the western worker is no match for the japanese samurai worker quot p the final section contains precious specific advice such as quotrespect local culture quot and quotdevelop long term objectives quot one of the deepest pieces of timeless advise is that quotif you drop your chopstick in asia it means good luck quot i guarantee you won t know a thing about doing business in japan after reading this book but you may be amused reading it it seems that a ticket to austin powers may represent better value en 
just bad this book just drowns in the satire it tries to create it takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it s just the same thing over and over again meet a drunk stupid noble befriend him and buy his dead souls if you can get past that the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired wit as people like to call poor commentary on a society 
dressed up postmodern metafiction the first book of auster s new york trilogy was originally published in and in was adapted into this graphic novel i ve never read the original or any of the other parts of the trilogy so i can t comment on karasik and mazzicchelli s adaptation however i can say that since i m not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for auster s story this really didn t do anything for me at all the story is basically an exercise in metafiction and if you like that stuff great i do not it is dressed up at least initially in the mystery genre but that s just window dressing theres a long legacy especially in france of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings for example alain robbe grillets two books the erasers and the voyeur or the films of jean pierre melville the story begins fairly straightforwardly a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named daniel quinn lives in new york on his own since the death of his wife and son a complete stranger calls him and thinks quinn is a private detective named paul auster and begs him to to take his case the writer paul auster and his family shows up for one scene it s that kind of book quinn meets with the strange man who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father who was seeking to discover the true language of god the father has been released from jail and quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he s been following and his clients he spends several months watching the building and going crazy once he realizes they ve disappeared he finds his own life has disappeared as well obviously this is all somewhat about identity but it s more about fun stuff like language representation and other tiresome postmodern subjects as are the other two parts of the trilogy which involve a man spying on someone and yet another disappearance it has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world auster has thrust his characters into the simple heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic however if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters this is probably not for you fans of auster may enjoy this but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen 
there is a problem the problem is if you are not familiar with th century irish history you will be lost reading this book when part ends doyle provides the reader with no historical background and writes the book assuming that the reader is all ready well versed in irish history i also had trouble visualizing ireland the places buildings streets and the battle scenes which i attribute to doyle s lack of description and to my lack of irish knowledge

misery disappointing read after reading the kite runner a story about friendship loyalty during the adverse times in afghanistan during the taliban i was looking for another read centered on these harsh times in afghanistan the swallows of kabul was endorsed as book for those that enjoyed the kite runner however disappointly other than being set in afghanistan the books similarities end there i appreciated the descriptions about life during the taliban rule the author painted a vivid image on what it would have been like to walk down the street during these times you felt sympathic towards the two couples eventually their lives intertwined but not how you would have expected them i was disappointed in the outcome of the story and was left with a feeling that the book was incomplete

interesting story but the writing is awful did this woman really receieve a degree in communication well i m not sure what sort of communication it was but as a fiction writer she needs help there are more blatant amateurish errors here than in any book i have ever seen published anywhere just a few examples page she wraps a cloth around my head obscuring my sight limon raises a wan eyebrow this is a viewpoint violation which would be recognized as such by any beginning writer of fiction in a first person story you can t describe something you can t have seen page retorted my father who walked in with the doctor page same scene paragraphs later hello john briggs said the doctor shaking my father s hand this sentence contains two errors first why would the doctor need to greet the man he walked in the door with it s also highly unlikely that he would address him by both his first and last name if he knows him well he might call him by his first name and if not he d call him mr briggs page at june s ranch in mississippi after the house was sold to new owners i page paragraphs later next scene i considered returning to my aunt s mississippi ranch to look more closely through the piles of june s papers these sentences contain both a redundancy why would you say a house was sold to new owners when it s sold they are always new owners and a logic error you can t generally go back to a place you have sold and look through the effects of the person who used to own it because when you sell a house you generally don t leave personal crap there do you page and page both contain a definition of jinetera a redundancy but the definitions do not quite match page six says it means a jockey and page says a female jockey and these are only the ones that have jumped out at me so far i am only up to page if it was my job to look for them i d bet my last orgasm that i d find dozens more i would probably want to avoid harper collins if i was an author i think you could make the case that the editors at harper collins really are the ones to blame and of course they are ultimately if this was edited it was not by anyone who was awake but those who call this well written are pretty deluded the writer made these errors and while some of the inconsistencies were probably created in changing the storyline during rewrites it s still pretty lousy writing and it creates a reasonable doubt as to the intelligence of the author and hence the reliability of the observations in the story 
different world i bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation i feel that most of what i read is simply not factual as a person i feel strongly that i would not want to tell anyone that i knew the author or was his friend maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience 
collective disappointment this book was chosen by my office reading group it was generally felt to be a disappointment i for one really liked the writing style and prose but wondered why simpler words were not chosen some felt too they required a dictionary by their side it was definitely a book one could easily put down there wasn t much in the way of character development and the story lacked intrigue the ending too was a disappointment 
good sex no plot i just finished reading laurel k hamiliton s latest danse macabre i was very disappointed the novel gave a good sense of her true strengths and weaknesses as a writer she is good at talk bad at plot good at sex bad at action good at erotica bad at depth and breadth of character the story such as it is goes talk about relationships fight with richard have sex move to another room talk about relationships fight with someone else have sex move to nearby corridor fight with richard have group sex repeat etc one novel like that could be an accident or bad editing two or three is a weakness in the writer i admire her for starting a genre but she now just writes women s porn and the problem with women s porn is that we re not really into i 
known as america s poet whitman is not poetic walt whitman s life s work is his leaves of grass enlarged over the years with additional poems regarded as america s poet whitman wrote in the s through the s encompassing both the manifest destiny ideology of the pre war through the reconstruction period of us history the poems are diverse and upbeat the language for the most part is clear and easy nevertheless like most poetry today the poems are so little different from prose except in the presentation into lines very few poetic devises are used one may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry but in comparison to rhyhming verse by longfellow frost byron browning or shakespeare current poetry appears meaningless although a classic leaves of grass offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology none of his poems are memorable not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature i give two stars to the work simply because i must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie dead poet s society so the reputation of the work must be quite impressive though it beats me how that is 
the only dummy is the person who buys this book just read the th edition it only took a couple of hours to go through it it is a schill for aol and geo cities it also pushes netscape composer which is probably an out of date web design package briefly describes html in a very very basic manner you will not be able to get a web page up with what is published in this book the book convinced me to get a copy of frontpage 
buyer beware if you suffer from physical problems similar to ms selak s you will find this book useful if you do not you will have wasted your money buying it i expected more than a recitation of ms selak s journey through her own chronic disease there are many other chronic diseases whose progression of symptoms is quite different this confusion could have been easily overcome by giving the book a title that indicated exactly what chronic diseases were discussed within it as a person with a chronic disease of an entirely different type i am familiar with the emotional roller coaster one must travel but my reactions were quite different from hers no right no wrong what is wrong is for her to set forth her own reactions as some sort of standard for the rest of us how sympathetic can one be toward a woman who disregards her own well being as well as the efforts put in by her fellow cast members just to fulfill an immature fantasy of being a star suppose she hadn t been able to control the pain with medication wjat would have happened to the rest of the cast who had worked so hard to put on this production if she had the stamina to complete the grueling three week run of the show no wonder the insurance company had doubts about the extent of her disability 
disappointing katzenbach is a good writer his the analyst is one of the best thrillers i ve read and hart s war and the madmans tale are well written gripping stories however with state of mind i found my own mind wandering as i read it somehow it is too long and not particularly compelling the future america he devises where everyone is armed and guards escort office workers to their cars is not perhaps far fetched but felt superficial it merely existed as a counterpoint for a new st state where everyone was safe dont bother with this book especially when katzenbach has written so much better 
outdated and not very informative i was hoping to learn things i hadn t seen in other books but i didn t not only is the book outdated but it s also quite limited in what it offers i was not happy with it at all 
obvious ideas i was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine for a topic at the university she came to the classroom with this book as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching first of all i thought it s not a topic for the kind of subject we were having discussing in the classroom secondly the things the authors wrote are so obvious at least for some persons that all i can say is that i really had a very good time reading it as a comic book nothing else i laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a or year old pupil because he touched her on the arm it was a lecture not a simple explanation ! clearly we have to be polite encouraging and nice towards the students but this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way that i could only laugh i never had problems with students in my classes i always tried to encourage them to like the subjects i am sure they learned many things as well as i learned from them too this book was just a waste of time the worst thing is that the teacher i am talking about the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is doesn t practice what the book preaches ! she is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to how is it possible she didn t learn anything from it maybe it s good for people who are starting a teaching career then i would say read it but even though i would be very cautious but being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states i could imagine it wouldn t really be that good 
will someone get this man an editor the cobra event is a jarring book not because of theplausibility of the plot nor because it goes intoexcruciating pains to describe dead boies and theirsubsequent autopsies but because there are so manyerrors on its pages worse there are whole chaptersdevoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps meundersatand the story better pages and pages offiller it was like reading a doughnut among the worst are changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph ihave no idea why a paragraph that starts with the pastperfect tense suddenly switches to the present tensein the second sentence and it didn t happen justonce using you all the time the book has this verycondescending accusatory tone when it directlyaddresses me as though it knows what i know and don tknowmaxing out the filler potential i know that detailhelps to make stories seem authentic but really taking a paragraph to explain the history of katz sdelicatessan is superfluous argh 
a story about ideals versus self protection fear versus identity in this novel ha jin writes like a chinese michel houllebecq the language is simple and direct and the ultimate outlook for humanity is grim the protagonist is also a shy young male on the outer rim of the mainstream community like a lot of the modern chinese fiction the novel is preoccupied with the psychological damage inflicted by china s communist years and the paranoia and self censorship that occurs to this day the year is and the narrator s teacher wang has just had a severe stroke the narrator jian is studying for the phd candidacy exams he is a student of classical chinese poetry and hopes to be granted a phd so that he can move to beijing to live with his fiancee meimei who is his teacher s daughter wangs stroke has left him raving and mad jian is assigned by the university secretary to care for wang while he is in hospital during jian s afternoons spent in the hospital room he is audience to his teacher s ravings which begin to reveal all sorts of disturbing truths that had managed to stay hidden until that point the story is set against the backdrop of the student activism leading up to the demonstrations in tiananmen square toward the end of the novel jian becomes so disillusioned by his teacher s revelations that he decides to forfeit the phd exams resulting in meimei s breaking up with him aimless he travels to beijing and takes part briefly in the student demonstrations amid the violence he is lucky enough to find his way back to the train station to return to his university in shanning upon return he is informed that he is about to be taken away for his role in the beijing demonstrations and the novel ends with him on the run having been forced by circumstances to abandon his belongings his friends and his identity the stark language with which the ending is rendered makes it all the more appalling the matter offactness with which jian takes the steps to erase himself from his previous life suggests the ordinariness of his actions in such extraordinary times 
tv sitcomgonebook native tongueby carl hiaasenthis book is fast paced has a lot of energy and a zany weirdness no doubt it is a page turner and it is better than the other book of hiaasen s i have read double whammy but all that does not a good read make a strength of hiaasen s books are his characters well defined and numerous most are straightforward stereotypes from the out ofluck journalist turnedpublicist the vapid sex phone girlfriend a steroid doped strongman the crude andsleazy millionaire bad guy a muscular butclearminded black good guy cop to the dumb butintrinsically good guy burglars and loads of redneck florida crackers hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops and by casting two characters that are quite original an environmentally militant aged woman and an environmentally crazed former governorgonewildman and we meet psychotic whales and sex starved dolphins etc etc so what s wrong mainly it s that the book stays at a level of tv sitcomgonebook it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject one might think that the exception is the environment but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment if you like brainless action gratuitous violence gross humor and zany fun native tongue might satisfy i have one additional problem with hiassen and it s similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton these books stink of hypocrisy crichton makes a seriously good living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science hiassen s heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society but hiaasen s writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent 
not what i expected i was looking for a book that showed how to make a cake to look like a character not how to make a character for the top of a cake i was disappointed 
essay on gen x wto and other flashbacks from the s turner s book relates a collection of his opinions and personal anecdotes regarding s culture counterculture and the pivotal role he argues the simpsons played in all of this while the premise was thought provoking enough to keep me reading out of curiosity the book falls short in several ways first you probably won t learn much new about the simpsons secondly this book is long and dense turner s writing style is not just erudite but overly sophisticated in a way you d expect to see from a college student who is really really trying to earn that a grade his style often slides back and forth from academic to hipster you find yourself marveling at his vocabularly that is until the umpteenth reference to american hegemony which brings us to the second problem political bias intrudes all too often while i m not at all offended by his taking a liberal perspective on the simpsons turner s unrelenting focus on the simpsons supposed fight against american hegemony gets old and starts to look downright immature more importantly he seems to miss the point the simpsons satire everybody right the simpsons writers have always skewered aging hippies and disaffected youth liberal targets right along with the easy targets such as corporate stooges and lazy americans turners impassioned analysis often gets derailed by his own inability to take a break from his own pet concepts pages that may have been devoted to something like what the simpsons says about childhood in america much could be mined from the whole world of ralphie nelson milhouse and others are instead given to rambling tangents about s zeitgeist and such things as the raves and concerts the author attended in this way as other reviewers have said here the book is too often about chris turner and not often enough about the simpsons some parts are actually very funny but it should be noted that these funny parts tend to be in the footnotes which re tell in detail various antics from simpsons episodes that perhaps you haven t seen for awhile as other reviewers have rightly pointed out you may as well just put your money toward the dvds and enjoy it firsthand this hefty book is clearly a labor of love overall it s a mildly interesting sometimes amusing and often annoying essay while it s long enough to be a good academic treatise on the simpsons and society a disappointing number of pages are consumed by the author s birdwalking socio political rants and stories 
outdated information i did not check the copyright date before purchasing the book which i hoped to use as a resource in a seniors internet class that i teach unfortunately this means that this information is years old on the first two pages alone only out of web addresses are still valid not worth the price the links that do still work are helpful that is the only reason for the one star 
this book is not what i expected i have studied practiced and taught managerial accounting for more than years at work using excellent supporting text and case books from recognized us authors but to be honest dr kaplan is making easy concepts to appear complicated and cumbersome his case readings as well as the text materials are very length and hard to quotdigestquot since it does not capture the attention of the reader i would not recommend the book neither for and undergraduate or graduate degree despite the well known and worldwide recognition of dr kaplan his book is far from being pedagogical in nature 
collaborating with the enemy al qaida and hezbollah would agree with the authors terrorism aims to undermine western civilization and replace with it with an evil empire that would murder all jews and those who love them walsh and keesmaat along with stanley hauerwas and most who teach social ethics at most protestant and roman catholic seminaries live in a fantasy persepctive that cannot see who constitutes the enemy as an former smug liberal socialist and pacifist i find these ethicists an embarassment and danger if america britain and israel so does the whole of western civilization walsh keesmaat and their crowd will be in prison with the rest of us will they be part of the resistance or will they collaborate with the enemy i have always been in ministry to those of moderate income who understand what is the cost of freedom african and asian christian immigrants to our nation understand that cost as well let walsh and keesmaat talk to those who grew up under marxist regimes as well as those in exile from saddam hussein the taliban and the iranian theocrats they appreciate the judaeo christian foundations that constituted america ! the true prophets are charles colson jean beth elshtain richard john neuhaus sean hannity dennis prager laura ingraham george weigel and the center for ethics and public policy along with the institute for religion and democracy as well as the journal first things kenneth macari 
not what i expected slow boring after reading and liking the analyst i picked up the madman s tale i found it slow boring a little confusing the pages were good 
disappointing the plot is good but there are about pages too many why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach  case when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is we know where the precious document is another useless quest people are murdered by the half dozen the characters are outrageous most of the time improbable and i felt the semi erotic swimming episode totally stupid not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it i have read much better books than that sorry 
actors not authors i usually am entertained by the aforementioned actors but authors they are not i had less of a problem with garofalo s banter but stiller made no mistake about mentioning over and over that he was writing the book for the advance and the revenue that it would supply stiller s voice can virtually be heard through his writing which was just innane banter thrown down on a page and attached to his name with the hope that it would draw readers this book is not worth the time or the money that in essence is exactly what the authors were after their apparent motives are insulting to their fans and readers 
islam in america read the holy quran before reading any propaganda books like this any book on islam not written by a islamic scholar will be biased and racist the wisdom of the islamic faith can only be understood by understanding the life of the prophet mohammed pbuh the hadith will guide you in understanding the true path for all mankind please do not buy propaganda books go to the sourse of all islamic thought read the koran and the hadith and understand the truth without lies from american press 
the good soldier i know that i will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes this is one of only books that i have ever read that i truly regret devoting the time to but once i start a book i always finish i don t know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this i just don t get it the main character was quite annoying to me and the story was so slow and predictable i really just wanted it to end i would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you i am sorry 
it seems so boring to me to see science used as poetry as a sequel to math curse you d probably think science verse would be equally as good actually it s a disgrace ! firstly the poetry of science come on ! science and poetry have nothing in common secondly stupid ryhmes such as jack jump over the co hydrogen et cetra et cetra and the dinosaurs were destroyed by teachers is neither scientific nor interesting thirdly there are no brainteasers like in math curse just dull ryhmes that have no beat or tune just rhyming ! if you re looking for real sequal to math curse this is nowhere close 
sophie s choice gone wrong this is the story of stingo a y o aspiring writer in nyc in who meets a pair of lovers sophie and nathan at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship falling in love with both and witnessing their self destruction nathan is a mentally deranged and drug addicted genius sophie is a haunted polish survivor of auschwitz her story unfolds as she confides to nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the polish resistance her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart destroying choice when she arrives in the camp she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber while nathan and sophie are both fascinating fully realized characters with terrible obstacles stingo the narrator is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of which he is relating he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends tragedies and his actions and attitudes at the age of are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable the novel is far too long it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit the narrative style is foolishly ponderous far over written especially in the first half and in the end while the structure of narrator observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of nathan and sophie in the end the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind why did sophie so quickly choose eva to die rather than jan a lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl a blind panic a preference for her son the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose it is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed sophie and yet it s glossed over in the narrative in fact it s followed by sophie and stingo having an endless night of fung as the novel would put it really almost hard to believe sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations she uses sex to escape with her lover nathan but it s hard to imagine this all night sexcapade stingo relates could it be that styron only knows how to connect people through sex how this could be considered one of the greatest american novels of all time is a mystery to me the potential is there but only a truly talented dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
based on impractical assumptions the benefits of an armed society can never be adequately weighed against the detriments for a variety of reasons the chief one being a dearth of records on both national and local levels firearms like alcoholic beverages can be both used and misused however unlike firearms alcoholic beverages have no socially redeeming purposes there are significant numbers in our society who are alive and well because they had a firearm they could depend on when police weren t available courts have consistently held that governments don t have an obligation to protect individuals but the population at large indeed most murders are committed when there are no police present when one considers that police functions depend more on deterrent and solving crimes rather than protection the benefits of an armed society becomes even more apparent over the past several years the media has reported that police presence has been sparse to almost non existent following hurricanes like katrina and andrew and other natural disasters police have their own families to tend to and in extreme conditions it s conceivable that many thousands of people can be caught alone in extremely hostile environs unprotected when gun deaths are posted no one has any idea how many are criminals are shot by police how many criminals are killed and captured by citizens and how many criminals are killed by criminals we do know that nearly percent of all handgun deaths are due to suicide and there is no evidence that restricting handguns would result in fewer suicides in fact a year department of justice study conducted a number of years ago found that japanese americans had about the same rate on violent crimes as japanese japanese the same was true for white europeans and white americans and not surpisingly it was true in both cases with suicide the bottom line was that cultural disposition had more to do with violent crime and suicide rates than gun laws or the lack thereof speaking about gun laws there is no documented case in which more restrictive gun laws ever resulted in less violent crime in fact the opposite has almost always been the case so who can measure the cost of the human lives saved because a handgun was present when the local rift raft came by to cave someone s head in with a x or to rape or pillage in well over percent of the time an armed citizen doesn t even have to shoot a criminal much less kill to prevent a violent crime thus how do we calculate those benefits the same is true for hikers and campers who use firearms against bear snakes cougars or use them to signal others when they are injured or are lost i would be far more impressed had the authors tried to calculate or even concede that guns might actually be beneficial for those who complain about the criminal use of guns perhaps getting criminals off the streets would have a far more conclusive result on the real costs 
rechy s mosting disappointing and retch inducing novel open this book to any page and you ll be bombarded with one graphic gratuitous poorly written laugh out loud sex scene after another oh yeah baby give it to me that s it like that seriously that s how inane the dialogue is don t get me wrong i am a huge fan of rechy s and some of his work is downright brilliant i loved city of night this day s death the fourth angel and especially bodies and souls however the coming of the night is a thinly vieled excuse for straight up porn i went into the novel excited thinking rechy would have something profound to express about gay life before the coming of the night a metaphor for the aids epidemic instead i was bombarded with episodic sexcapades of several loosely connected one dimensional characters the sections involving clint haunted by and trying to escape from the mysterious cancer killing off his friends in new york orville a handsome gay black male trying to get by in the predominantly white gay community and thomas a lonely single old queen who just wants to be loved were the only compelling and interesting characters to me as an ardent supporter of aids awareness and a gay black male getting up there in age these characters could have really got a message across instead they and the rest of the novel are squandered away under the weight of the grossly explicit sex scenes that appear on every page other characters were pointless za za lagrand s sections a thinly veiled reference to porn director chi chi larue were utterly pointless and did nothing to further the plot along dave the sado masochist leather biker man and ernie the body builder with endowment issues were one dimensional characters i could care less about and buzz boo and fredo the homophobe gay bashing punks were predictable and boring its sad that this novel is so bad because it really had a lot of potential to get across some extremely powerful messages instead of focusing on the characters fleshing them out so i could care for them rechy gets too wrapped up in the sex scenes the majority of which are poorly written with some of the worst dirty talk dialogue i have ever read read this only if you ve read every jackie collins novel and long for a dirtier gay version of what she does rechy must have wrote this for the money because it really stinks pu 
disappointing i picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title but what i found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development the ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved i was disappointed 
a nice companion to mcquarrie s text i thought this was a terriable book by itself but makes for a nice companion when reading through mcquarrie s book mcquarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter one can usually find the answers or at least some hints within this book 
inaccurate in its review of at least one country i can only judge the article on the the government failure in tajikistan as it is a country i both lived in and studied for many years the author nasrin dadmehr explains the weakness of the current state by examining its historical background but that background as he presents it is full of omissions and inaccuracies for instance the word basmachi used to describe the armed rebel groups in s central asia does not mean bandits in russian as he claims it means nothing in russian because it is not of russian origin but was adopted from one of the local languages tajik or uzbek another example is that the author keeps referring to the two factions fighting for control over government as communists and islamists it is true that these labels have been exploited by both sides in order to attract foreign aid from countries where those things matter such as iran saudi arabia or russia however the actual division is based entirely on people s ethnic regional affiliations so unless you accept the idea that everyone born in kulab is a communist and a gharmi accent automatically makes one a devout muslim those labels mean as much as the logos of two opposing teams in a football field chicago bears are not really bears the islamist opposition forces are not united by islam and there has not been any communists in tajikistan for many years apart from perhaps a few senior citizens nostalgic for the times when they had something to eat so whenever anyone describes the conflict in tajikistan as a struggle between communists and islamists it is a good indication that they have very little knowledge or understanding of the political situation in that country there are plenty of other inaccuracies as well like the description of may events according to the author this is when backed by popular support and two months of non stop demonstrations the opposition forces succeeded in imposing a coalition government on the communists in reality the imposing part involved an ambush of the city airport by a heavily armed group of militants who proceeded to capture president nabiyev as he was trying to flee the country and forced him at a gunpoint to sign his resignation there was no coalition government created and the following few months of the opposition s rule were filled with as much oppression and extreme violence towards kulabis as was later directed at gharmis when the power switched back around the two month long non stop demonstrations that had led to this incident included one for the opposition and one supporting the government both were heavily organized with people being recruited and bussed in from remote villages to be fed clothed and financially compensated for the two months of camping in the middle of the city no information about who was paying for all that expression of popular will on either side was ever publicly released even if these omissions in the article seem minor or irrelevant they reduce the complexity of the war in tajikistan to a goodies vs baddies comic book type scaffle that incidentally brings about the collapse of the government the collapse itself and the resulting chaos is described quite well but glancing over so many important aspects of what had led to it makes the resulting analysis somewhat skewed and one sided 
don t waste your money first it took forever to get this book shipped and then when i did receive it what a disappointment most of the photos are poor lots of noise in most enlargments which is very surprising for life second there is very little written information 
don t pay for advertising a very dissapointing title from taunton basically a series of near advertisements for systems you can buy and simply install the few do ityourself projects look like summer camp woodshop material 
sorry i spent the time like others i picked this book up after reading several in the no ladies series no comparison the story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book i just don t understand the rest of this book isabel never even asked the key question to the whole mystery until it slapped her in her silly face the mystery for me is what is the sunday philosophy club and what in the world does it have to do with this book im sorry i spent the time on this there are important books to be read 
not my style too rigid and too religous for my taste some good ideas if you can get past the pitfalls though 
unbelievable waller is usually awesome but i think he missed it on puerto vallarta squeeze not that i wasn t entertained because i was in a mindless sort of way the book is a made fortv script just waiting to happen ! but mediocre waller is better than most at their best so buy this book used if possible 
dont buy it there is no information giving it took me hours to finish whole book which is less than pgs dont buy it 
all reading and unclear pictures usually when i buy an exercise book i expect clear concise directions and maybe a picture to illustrate what exactly the correct form would be well if you are expecting this out of this book you my as well forget it although it was very informative black and white pictures that aren t even shown for all exercises is not going to cut it for example for a tricep kickback it doesn t really show you the ways that it would be wrong which can lead to an injury if you are looking for information go for it but if you want something that will show you the right way with pictures skip it 
nothing but a promo for x the movie it reads in the cover that it is the updated edition but it actually cut bios about other mutants that came in the previous edition the non updated to include a quotbehind the scenes of the movie quot i think the publishers should realize by now that the comic made the movie and not the other way it s sad that they sacrifice valuable information to turn it into a promo 
for the choir santayana has a flowing style and is a master of rhetoric do not read this work if you are looking for a well argued thesis he lets points stand on sweeping generalizations that will only be accepted by those already in agreement santayana s critiques of religion rest upon sociology rather than philosophy and his appreciation of religion is limited and patronizing 
just not my cup of tea i believe this book is strictly for scholars and hindus it is somewhat dry and unless you have an overwhelming interest in the subject can become quite dull it does have excellent detail and structure for those interested in the subject but alas i have discovered i am not 
it didn t work for me either i too read this book cover to cover with high hopes for success i took notes and paid extra attention on how to perform each technique when a particular therapy had more than one technique i tried the first with no improvement and worked my way onto the next and still i saw nothing i got no immediate results as promised and no results still i ve been very disappointed with this book 
written on childish intellectual level yet not even good as that i read about half the book before calling it quits for good i love the real issaac asimov stories but this is not even a respectable imitator if there are any at all first we are expected to buy the idea of time travel into the past a logical impossibility that has occasionally been gotten away with when there was great action or character development to compensate halfway through i realized that this book would have neither of these instead two of the main characters an outdoorsman and paleantologist inexplicably bicker with each other about nothing at all from the moment they meet wus hidden agenda seems to be to advocate environmentalism a religion the daily tabloids and ivory tower politician pseudoscientists are doing enough to disseminate on their own this is not even good for children as it is poorly written is philosophically flawed and is uselessly descriptive eg the main female character is described as prettyso what fortunately i ve yet to read over half of the real asimov stories so i have something to look forward to 
no pressing instructions after i cut out all the pieces for the my heart belongs to chocolate quilt i discovered that there are no pressing instructions for this quilt and it really needs them ! one of the main reason i buy patterns is so i don t have to spend time figuring out things like pressing instructions i won t buy any more books from this author 
disappointing but redemptive at the end one would think getting a starred review meant the book was spellbinding but i did not find that to be the case the idea of poe as a character was intriguing enough for me to read the book and through much of it the quality of the plot and dialog was top notch unfortunately about in you could see which way the plot was going and it was a disappointment to find a plot unfolding that was reminiscent of cornwall or patterson at their commercial worst however things turn around in the last pages and the last plot twists make slogging through the corny initial motives for the crime worthwhile almost 
not baxter s finest hour transcendent takes the fun of transcendental philosophy and merges it with the raw excitement of project management it s not just boring it s unfocused too transcendent is part sci fi part eco thriller part family drama and part ghost story the bulk of the book revolves around michael poole who splits his time between chasing the ghost of his dead wife and starting an eco recovery business the ghost story subplot which culminates in a excorcism believe it or not seems out of place in a sci fi novel such as this and is wrapped up in a lot of religious and philosophical psychobabble likewise stephen is a little heavy handed with the message of ecological responsibility and spends too much time going through the mundane details of the startup and business deals for poole s eco recovery project the other of the book revolves around alia who has to answer some questions about for the godlike transcendence a meta mind that s stumbling over some very basic facts of life even more rediculous is that the transencdence which is beyond the farthest imagining of mere humans has a proposed solution to its problem which basically amounts to take my ball and go home i can say no more without giving anything away but the universe s supermind seems to have the intellect of a walnut its not just the transcendence who has issues the poole family relations are a non stop car wreck a subplot which makes the book feel like a soap opera at times in particular the protagonist s adult son spends the entire novel acting like a spoiled year old likewise the book never explains why the transcendence would want to join with alia who also comes off as both incredibly selfish and immature its also fairly odd that years in the future lethe is still being used as an interjection the origin of the term is presented here but it s fairly odd that it would stick around for for a length of time that s much greater than the length of recorded human history nobody uses terms like baloney or balderdash anymore and those were in use a century ago years come on last but not least anyone who makes it past the final pages deserves an honorary doctorate in philosophy you ll be able to discuss the ontology and philosophy behind the meaning of love and intellect with the best of them unfortunately you have to read through a grad school term paper to get any closure out of this book i was tempted multiple times to just chalk this one up to a loss and start on something else mr baxter you can do better 
too much guess work and very little science even though it was fun to read i give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence this book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades one reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts that reviewer failed to point out that it was in the descent of man not origin of the species where darwin first presents man as having descended from apes evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development it s the worse case of reductionism in history james d watson and edward wilson were on the charlie rose show talking about this book they described natural selection as the single great development in science since newton they claimed to describe this book as great english literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological how could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific scientists aren t supposed to be cavalier in their judgment scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment first of all let s quote darwin himself from this book page to suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural selection seems i freely confess absurd in the highest degree there you have it from darwin himself from his famous book yet today textbooks that claim a lineage to darwin depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection evolutionists like robert h hurlbutt oppose william paley s design argument because it makes god not natural selection the origin of design in the human eye see hurlbutt s book page hume newton and the design argument watson and wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument but while hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing which passes for education these days how could two nobel prize winners of science watson and wilson make such a foolish mistake first of all watson and wilson are crooks their nobel prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of dna was illfounded rosalind franklin of king s college is well known to have discovered the structure of dna and her supervisor wilson passed it on to watson and crick who along with wilson took credit for it a little research by the nobel prize committee would have discovered this i guess the nobel prize really isn t worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards einstein was given a nobel prize even though his papers on brownian movement are a plagarization of josiah willard gibb s book statistical mechanics concluding unscientific postscript could darwin s descent of man have psychological origin in the fact that darwin himself looked like a monkey 
culture shock italy i purchased this book to learn more about doing business in italy and i found there was not enough detail i did learn how vastly different each region is in italy and the author tries to show the differences in each region perhaps this is why i felt that it didn t do a deep dive into the regions i was most interested in 
fast start to boring predictability i was very excited to read this book and i was immediately enticed right into the story i loved the color of the story the characters as well as the compelling flow of the beginning of this story it starts off being a magical page turner that seemingly is moving into an even more exciting story but from that great start the story in my opinion goes no where other reviewers of this book have just cause to write that there are perhaps too many characters that might in deed be true the problem with the book for me is that it becomes incredibly predictable been there done that i would have preferred the fantasy elements of this book to have stuck with the native american aspects as well as other unique entwinements instead of delving into the same old fantasy elements with merlin myrrdin taliesin and the same old stories intertwined i thought by using well known celtic and druidic mages of old reduced the book and story i was dissapointed when taliesin officially entered the multitude of central characters the book plays out more of a day dream or lucid dream of someone would want to have happened in thier life rather then a truly good story the story gets to a point where it absolutely ceases to surprise i found myself skipping through pages to get to the end i knew that i wasn t missing anything and that is such a contrast to how the book starts off the book plays out like a below average horror mystery story with a very weak horror aspect there are very clever and magically woven points laced into the book especially the beginning but the story runs into so many problems and ultimately just loses its momentum it s too bad because it had great potential but one can see from this book the first by de lint that he had great potential potential that many would argue was surely fulfilled with his later books which still continue to come out today if you are looking for the best of de lint or simply a good fantasy read i would definitely not start here i give it stars only because of its great beginning but the rest of the book is just flat out dissapointing 
don t waste your money i should have listened to the people who wrote negative reviews this book is a complete and total ripoff it tells you nothing save your money and buy a bottle of wine instea 
a tale the novel a tale of two cities by charles dickens is a story of love and compassion which takes place during the beginnings of the french revolution despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for dickens writing style throughout the novel dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes the language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on the character of lucie manette is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws her character is the supposed epitome for women but in truth is highly improbable throughout the novel dickens does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue despite these countless imperfections dickens does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution the book with all its shortcomings did reveal to the reader the atrocities that occurred during the french revolution and the events that led to it the abuse of the nobles and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel the one other aspect that dickens got right in his novel was the character of sydney carton sydney carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what carton feels carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life this characteristic is common among people and dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely the novel a tale of two cities is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often dickens overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book s dryness however dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy this is a book for a reader who likes dickens overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories 
mid fi with little explanation this is an extension of slone s earlier book and it is a little better but not a lot he reiterates everything he said earlier ranging from opinion to nonsense and then as before launches into his pet designs with little good explanation if you want to build a class b semi serious amplifier for instrument or pa or non seriouslistening use this will probably work although there are a lot of old s and s designs readily available at your local library in old electronics and audio magazines if understanding the trends in serious audio work today is your goal start with the horses mouth jaes paper tubes vs transistors is there a difference this was hugely important because it was the first published paper in professional reviewed circles that addressed the possibility that traditional metrics such as thd frequency range and s n might not fully address problems in professional audio 
don t judge a book by its cover i bought this book for my pre k class to go along with our weather unit on rain the cover looked so nice i thought it would be a great book in fact the illustrations are quite nice the problem is there s really no story here the language doesn t flow its very choppy the children didn t enjoy this book and have not asked for it to be read again good children s literature should have a story to it a setting problem and solution a definite beginning middle and ending and well defined characters this book has none of that 
stars gasping for breath elizabeth berg has written several humane touching so real they hurt novels about relationships patient nurse the affecting never change families say when and she s written them with uncommon grace knowledge and understanding of what makes us tick the genesis of we are all welcome here was a letter from a fan marianne raming asking berg to write about her mother who was stricken with polio before marianne was born in the prologue to this novel berg at first recoils then warms to the idea telling her fan your mother s circumstances will serve only as inspiration for a different story that i will make up if you want her real story to be told contact a non fiction writer unfortunately berg may have had better luck writing this book in the non fiction form for as it is waawh is mostly flat and uninvolving except that the central story a mother trying everything that she can to raise her child despite being incapacitated by polio and living in an iron lung is without a doubt rife with drama and tension berg s novel isn t what it is is flat and oddly enough very much like reportage berg in her quest to avoid the trappings of non fiction falls victim to them nonetheless with the just the facts style of prose she adopts here and then i read this gorgeous scene at the very end of the novel its everywhere she said and those were the last words i heard her speak she meant redemptive beauty i think despite her many obstacles what my mother succeeded best in doing was appreciating the many forms of beauty in life as well as its possibilities and she relished perhaps more than any other mother could the growth of her daughter seeing in me a part of herself set free if only this novel as a whole could have been as elegant as perceptive as intelligent as these last few words on the last page of this book 
depends on your point of view grabhorn starts with the assumption that our feelings can change the course of events around us while there is some truth to this assumption grabhorn claims that our feelings could even change seemingly random events like getting rear ended on the highway one logical question is that if two people ask the universe to use grabhorn s terminology for opposing events who would succeed the question belies the assumption that there exists a plurality of distinct and individual freewill this assumption is conveniently discarded throughout the book claims that whatever one asks for will come to pass litter the entire narrative grabhorn states that we need to vibrate at the high frequencies ie those that make us feel good attracting the same kind of frequencies to us her analogy is that we are magnets attracting the same kind of frequency back to our lives the law of the universe that she proclaims is like attracts like one issue with grabhorn s analogy is that we tend to appreciate a blend of different frequencies musical instruments all resonate at different frequencies it is the combination of different frequencies that appeals to us music spiritual or otherwise incorporates a variety of frequencies and tempos to arouse our souls another is whenever in nature there are forces of attraction and repulsion it is opposites that attract in magnetism we learn that opposite poles attract it is sometimes posited that we are naturally attracted not only to the opposite sex but also to those with accents that are different from our own fundamentally the assumptions grabhorn makes are more outlandish than what most readers are comfortable making the process of feeling good does have medically and psychologically proven benefits but is living as if something were true is an entirely different issue grabhorn s techniques of make belief would be too machiavellian for our post modern outlook the book could have greatly benefited from the services of an editor the text could have been more concise and the narration could have been more crisp and lucid a good first draft but more work is needed armchair interviews says hampton roads publishes books for the evolvinghhuman spirit on metaphysical subjects including visionary fiction complementary and alternative medicine self help science and spiritual this seems to be a book you will either love or hate depending on your point of view

review on what if this is an item you are interested in forget about it at least forget about ordering it from amazon i ordered it in mid january it is mid march and i still haven t received it so honestly i can t write a review on something i haven t read order it from somewhere else so you can actually read it and write your own review 
this book is not very good it s about a boy who started out in kindergarten he found out that he would be in school a long time he had a problem and through up every were any given moment the only thing i liked about this book is that it had a somewhat ok plot and it it s about a boy and his life the main thing i didn t like this book because it was pretty dull and boring i fell asleep most of the time i started to read it if you realy realy realy like books that you might think it s ok it just was not like somthing in real life but it was not a good fictional story also this book was not very interesting it was pretty much like if you have to read a book for i d say ok but if you wanna read it for fun i wouldn t if i was you 
open house this is another of those books for me that was very middle of the road it was not terrible and it was not great it was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary 
illegal surgery and the medical community the daughter of a prominent boston doctor is dead apparently from a botched abortion which was illegal in the late s dr john berry s friend art lee is in jail for the crime which he says he didn t commit so dr berry sets out to prove his friend s innocence and runs into cover ups and lots of secrets but there are many doubts such as was the girl really pregnant and did dr lee actually perform the surgery and why is dr berry so interested in finding the culprit for michael crichton s first novel it s not bad but nowhere near as good as some later ones the plot is marginally interesting but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn t sound very natural dr berry who just takes the whole work week off to investigate talks more like a cheesy private eye than a doctor also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts nice to know but annoying to look up 
bad flaps great little book except the pictures under the flaps are totally off this makes it frustrating for little ones to know what they are looking at usually thomas the tank engine stuff is much better quality

ultimately a dreary read this is the only one of myers book that i read i disliked it early on but i was determined to see it through the novel has some wit some mystery some cleverness but oh what an unsatisfying mish mashthe writing style is skittish from page one to the finish so nothing is developed to any extent that you start caring about anything i just yearned for release at the last page the lack of focus was grating but i appreciated the author s gumption of sticking to her style this is a light distraction all froth and little substance 
do not read this book i couldn t find any good reading material so i read bloods instead that was a big mistake this was possibly the worst written piece of literature i have ever had the misforture to read the book was repetitive the underlying theme was a crock and the book was more of a colorful adventure novel than an oral history all in all it was a terrible book 
take a pass i tend to like books like this sadly not this one as a year chicago police veteran with my last assignment in the detective division i picked this up to read when i noticed that it took place in a district i had worked at one time the main character is somewhat real kind of hard edged like an officer with a few years on the job i was ready to forgive the author stretching the boundries of the rd district way up to the th past the th i could also forgive for the sake of the story that her boss a sergeant not a lieutenant or captain as in real life would call her in on her day off not likely certainly given that she would have to be paid at a great overtime rate i could even forgive that she would walk into the men s locker room to ask who she was working with not likely in any district and certainly not i might even forgive that her boss or any of the officers would make her work with her ex for a tour but when she gets into a shooting where her partner is shot and she doesn t or he as it first starts when he is still alive call in shots fired a or as the title suggests officer down then things begin to go south real fast to begin with they had requested back up at this location before going in for the deparment to suspect that this was a bad incident and not to take her word from the start and begin to look for the named suspect is dumb in any shooting such as this on duty the benefit of the doubt would go to officer and all effort would be made to find the offender certainly the word of another of the beat cops that he couldn t find any sign of someone being there would not be given any value and if this were indeed an empty building in that area it would be loaded with signs of occupants previous or squaters if it was to be determined after investigation that he had been shot by her rather than the bad guy only then would steps be taken to suspend her sadly most of the police story doesn t ring true at all lastly while the author seems to know locations it s too bad that for all her knowledge of the city she didn t know that we don t have das in chicago or illinois it is an sa or states attorney and the police deal with asas for investigations as another reviewer mentioned this is just the same old story about the female officer blamed for something that she hadn t done by the bad old police deparment forced to prove herself skip the effort for this one and read a better one 
this is basicly new age demonology i can do all things through christ who strengthens me philippians put your faith in the bible and gods wordsnot through shakti gawaintrust jesu 
too dense as a student reading this book for a class focusing on the french revolution i found it too dense for someone who has no previous knowledge of the revolution doyle packs a lot of information into these pages he does not place emphasis on any particular people or events which makes understanding specific turning points difficult however i can imagine this book would be ideal for one who already has a thorough understanding of the french revolution and is simply looking for a new perspective 
good writing good idea the writing is good from a technical standpoint i don t have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well the idea is a good one too what i can t get past is the character robert langdon langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second another thing i have trouble with is dan brown s knack for slowing the pace of the story things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense the problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff like playing fetch with a dog you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it s finally tossed this book is an easy read but i think it is a bit over rated 
terrible if you speak spanish i normally don t put a book down without finishing it especially one in the genre of classic american literature however hemingway s english translations were so irritating trite and immature that i could not get past them the use of thy and thou to indicate the ud form is ridiculous in th century english quoting the characters as asking how do you call yourself instead of what is your name is downright silly if hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally he should have simply quoted them in spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index regardless who needs a literal translation how is how do you call yourself better than what is your name and is it really important to know who uses ud to whom when this form doesn t even exist in modern english i found these translations so distracting from what was going on that i couldn t continue past chapter i get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past years don t speak spanish 
avoid this book like the plague that it is this book is horrible plain and simple it is repetitive there is no point to it and it has almost nothing to do with baseball kinsella a genius that wrote shoeless joe let me and you down with this horrible should i even say effort if you read this book you are wasting your time i wish i hadn t wasted my money on it maybe mr kinsella will refund the cover price i sure hope so 
where is the glory i dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap opera like compulsion always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our lord therefore i anticipated this final novel to be glorious as the title indicates but i was woefully wrong are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming king and his kingdom certainly not i support christian fiction with many star reviews just look at my other reviews but i can not recommend this series 
dumpster diving at the nivens s how can you know that you are really really famous one strong hint would be that people are willing even happy to pay good money for a reprint of your old emails on that criterion and based on the cheerful other reviews larry niven is really really famous dont get me wrong on my shelves are books with niven s name on the spine but this one is a shoddy collection of castoffs cobbled together not i hope by niven himself but by some marketing droid desperate to have some more niven product to sell it contains four actual stories totalling pp the rest is trivial filler including the above mentioned printout of emails those might be of interest to a phd candidate in english writing a thesis on collaborative methods in science fiction of the s but they are really for the wanna be sf writer who wants to fantasize that he or she is among the lucky handful who actually get to collaborate with larry niven in fact the emails are no more interesting than email between you and your co workers there s no writerly advice from larry to his pals no heres the golden secret of good plotting you could read a megabyte of such email and be not one adverb closer to publication of your work the rest of the trivia includes brief uninteresting excerpts from novels old short and dated essays a report on a trip to an sf con a brief intro to someone else s book and fragments of the canon ie notes on the milieu of the man kzin wars this stuff is just sweepings from the writer s office floor they show you nothing of niven s imagination or plotting skills their content would have near zero interest but for the fact that they were not swept up from your office floor but from larry niven sthe editing is shoddy as well there s no publication information at all no citations for published items no dates for unpublished ones there s just no way to tell what has been published before nor where for example half of the pp of actual fiction is a story procrustes but there s no hint that it was previously published as part of crashlander ballantine the lack of this data makes the book irritating to read ok when was this intercon he reports on and useless as scholarly source material this book is for the library of an obsessive niven completist collector ordinary readers will do well to save their 
cliched predictable i haven t read any of the real robert ludlum before but i don t think i will be starting if this is his style the action scenes with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts are perhaps better suited to a minute movie instead of a page book the weapons catalogue padding is comical at first later frustrating the childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places we know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest perhaps most disturbing is the book s overall s style racism in which the americans are dashing multi skilled warriors for good and the russians ukrainians even germans are all ugly inhuman or quickly dead whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water tight the reader is always a step ahead of the characters as other reviews have said suspense and mystery are left absent 
mixed feelings well straight out i will admit that i am only half way through this book but already i feel really bogged down and slightly confused ms myss seems to take a rather overly authoritative tone in this book as she mixes jungian psychology eastern religions and divination all in an attempt to convince her readers that through her guidance they can come to know the destinies chosen for them before their birth their sacred contracts i feel that the author tends to over simplify the concepts of destiny and pre destination as well as the nature of evil and does so through a rather verbose and strangely vague text i think that my eyes were really opened when i visited ms myss website and read the answers she had given to questions by her readers her arrogant attitude and insistance that her way is the only way left a sour taste in my mouth i must say many asked questions such as i can t narrow my personality down to only archtypes no matter how hard i try and you insist that there are four archtypes that everyone has no matter what i don t feel that i have all of these these questions were met with the insistance that there were only archtypes and that everyone has the four no matter what ms myss makes her theory sound like it is academically proven fact which it is absolutely not i m not sure that even jung would agree to the way that his concepts of the archtype have been used in this book in summary i am not sure that i will finish reading the book i want to just to see if there is something that i am missing closer to the end but from many of the reviews that i have read here i m not so sure it s worth it i suggest taking the book out from the library before you purchase it some may like the authoritative tone and complex theories of the book i did not 
i dont think so in the bokk space station seventh grade by jerry spinelli a kid named jason wants to build a space station ididnt really like this book because the author made the main idea hard to present i thought that the author jumped around from one subject to another for example one chapter was talking about football then the next was about halloween the author focuses on other subjects and doesn t realizes theres not enought infiormation about the main idea 
do not read this book do not read this book i attempted to read this book for a college class this book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal the public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable it is written at too high of a diction and griffin rambles on for pages on one topic which i won t spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash the subject information is interesting but this is written poorly and will bore the reader to tears just thought i d let you all know 
the operative word here is lightweight i m still searching for a really amazing knock my socks off adobe acrobat book that will take me beyond what i could find in the acrobat help or figure out myself i can capably make a pdf from word or any other application i don t care about embedding multimedia and i still see a sore need to find a book that covers forms really well this book fails both the breadth test and the depth test it might as well be one of the dummies books thanks for nothing 
worst book i have ever read in my life and i read lots i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star if you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book u should take advantage of i 
witty yet ultimately shallow i have to study this play for my alevels and would like to inform readers that this play is not worth reading it is filled to bursting with sexual innuendo and crude cheap jokes there are main issues that could be brought out such as deception relationships and the function of society but wycherley fails to ever reach any firm moral standing on any of these points the play is ultimately hollow of its concepts and is certainly not worth the effort 
history written by a loser from lind verbatim who won and who lost the vietnam war the only complete losers were the officials of south vietnam whose state was erased from the map may the dead maimed and mourning find some comfort that their misery could be yet more abject they could be suffering the pain of the war s cartographic consequences necessary war unnecessay b s 
well drawn but not my thing the subject matter isn t nearly as varied as the amazon review suggests the majority of it is vampires and vampire related activities it is very well drawn though bottom line i tore out pictures that i thought were especially sexy or good for art reference and threw away the rest if you like vampires this book is for you 
seconding the review by skisko i agree with this review the premise behind the book has great promise but is a very painful read and a great disappointment 
ho hum sorry its not what i expected i kept thinking where is this going it just wasn t funny it reminded me of something written years ago but that s not to say someone familiar with portuguese linguistics maybe a german academist or an up incoming dr dr longname etc etc hrumph cough could not read between the lines and find this humorous it was just a little dry and boring to me after the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors it got tiring i read every single book in the ladies detective series and couldn t wait to sink my teeth into the next precious ramotswe story this however was a disappointment i m only sorry i bought all in the series sight unseen based on the other books i d read by alexander mccall smith 
this is appalling teach your kid to use weights and measures and poison him herself with sugar and empty calories at the same time perhaps hershey s should also create a book on dental hygiene weight control and the advantages of hyperactivity i suppose this is approved by the bush administration s dept of education anything to keep corporate america happy ! pathetic 
highbrow negotiation techniques although i admire howard raiffa s book smart choices this book doesn t appeal me at all i felt his approach to negotiation too theoretical and extremely difficult to apply to real life issues as one of the other reviewers states correctly the book is rather for students of negotiation i do much more prefer getting to yes which sets an easy framework for approaching negoatiation 
disappointing i saw the house of doors recommended on the page for the movie cube with cube being one of my all time favorite movies the house of doors immediately caught my interest after reading the positive reviews i immediately picked it up and started reading with great expectations unfortunately i was disappointed the novel contains some great ideas unfortunately they are overshadowed by a couple flaws primarily too much is explained too early the antagonist and main purpose behind of the house of doors is revealed early on leaving little mystery for the reader to unravel secondly i found the writing style to be uneven at times the author frequently uses exclamation points and odd analogies which often come off rather silly it is something you do not want to see in a serious horror novel on another note from the write up i was expecting the novel to contain a fair bit of horror and gore while there are some moments i found them to be few and far between this did not matter to me i was more interested in the story those looking for a sci fi adventure with some horror elements may enjoy this novel if you are looking for a serious horror or mystery story i recommend looking elsewhere 
bland book i had a hard time forcing myself through this book i gave it to my year old son who is a francophile and a voracious reader and he couldn t get through it just kind of dry for a biography of a person who was probably pretty interesting 
not a page turner this was my first carlotta carlyle book and i thought it was boring i will not read another one i love murder mystery books and this was not a page turner the ending was very disappointing 
it just didn t grab me the way i expected i actually read this novel about four years ago and didn t really like it but after reading all the rave reviews on this site i decided to give it another try i came away feeling exactly the same way as before let down the plot never really grabbed me like i thought it would also i never really cared for the character of joe emotionally and physically scared by an abusive father joe grows attached to his foster family and even becomes his adopted father will s personal driver when will is murdered joe decides to uncover the mystery behind his death on his own sounds like it could be interesting huh well seems like most of you have but i just coulded get into this one when it was over i was relieved and that s not a good feeling sorry maybe the third time will be a charm but i don t see myself reading this again just to come away with the same opinion 
it doesn t get any more predictable than this the concept of this book could ve worked but sparks didn t develop any other characters to throw the reader off track it s painfully obvious who is driving the car the dialogue between miles and sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying as is their relationship interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by jonah with open arms and the ending to the story is laughable i won t give it away but i m sure you can figure it out within the first pages i doubt i can read another sparks novel again 
voodoo physics gary zukav states in his introduction i had never studied physics in fact i didn t like science and i had no mathematical aptitude on opra tv he admitted that he does not have a tv which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth i noticed that some reviewers refer to the new physics is that like new age or voodoo physics of the matter must be missing from this book or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of he even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose many people say they did not understand physics until this book surprises you still do not you now know what zukav wished physics was take anti mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater and the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats at least get it straight before mixing it up try reading some of these the ascent of man by jacob bronowski the book available everywhere the dvd s available from the uk the upanishads by eknath easwaran editor michael n nagler photographeror just about any mainstream material on physics and religion then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner the tao of physics an exploration of the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism by fritjof capra also on the fringe but not as radical as zukav is a series called what the bleep both in books and on video 
hey ! why don t we go to a teacher when we re sick too this guy needs to stop flattering himself he isn t controversial or innovative he is merely stupid the idea that some education or pysch major is going to have something important to say about biology is laughable it is clear he didn t take because he couldn t pass biology kind of goes against he s theories doesn t it i a physician found his references to hormones and neuroanatomy comical a failing pre med knows more than he does ! he states something about the hormones maturing faster in girls well last time i checked the structure of various hormones was constant the hormones themselves don t change a bit no one who had the slightest inkling of what they were talking about would refer to this is such terms this guy is just projecting his social agenda on a bunch of biological terms he doesn t understand the only people who would fall for this are those who a know less than he does and b have the same agenda 
blah blah blah this memoir was painful painful in a oh my god could it get any worse boring mundane cold flatlined it feels as though the author is emotionless and it got to a point where i just felt like shaking her and saying oh enough already sincerely just pass this one buy not even worth a library visit 
slow unlikely and mostly uninteresting story what michael cunningham does best in this book is the little things similes and metaphors and various details are almost always right on the story itself told in alternating first persons spends most of its time telling us about the characters especially toward the end it seems we have four psychologists who do very little other than analyze themselves and the others first people don t analyze themselves or others nearly to this degree second the characters actually do very little when not analyzing two other issues are the improbable three way love affair and bobby s indefinable sexual orientation the worst problem of all is that this is a character driven novel and i just didn t care about what happed to any of the characters 
advice from a ghost don t the reader reviewers of this book realize that charles givens settled numerous fraud lawsuits against him and his orginization in the early s and oh yeah he died in three years before the book came out this is just his family publishers cashing in on outdated advice 
where are my red slippers oh my god there is another patricia kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind i thought one patricia was enough but after reading this book i am faced with the frightening realization that there are two of them also what i find very disturbing is that this version of patricia may be even daffier than the original version after reading just or pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of patriciaitis and a dose of kennealyism by the th page i was searching for my red slippers so i could click them together and get back to kansas or anywhere else as long as my copy of this book didn t make the trip with me a pack of lies and a waste of paper and time i would rather read mary poppins than wade through this endless journey of rubble 
left me wanting more the characters are uninteresting and dimensional the dialog hackneyed i have no idea why it s on the new york times bestseller list it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else don t waste your money 
disbelief really hard to suspend mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend s death i am a great fan of nora roberts and really looked forward to this book believe me it is not one of her best i started off admiring her setting and characterization of the hale family but then this went on way too long it also took way too long to get to the real story the middle of the book bogged down to the point that i had to make myself keep reading which is very unusual for nora roberts much of the plot was over the top unbelievable how many boyfriends of one person can be killed the year mystic connection with bo doesn t quite come off either ill certainly remain a great fan of roberts but no one s perfect i guess 
obvious attempt at selling a novel to the movies i wish writers who attempt to write historical thrillers would take the time to read a book that was actually written and published in their chosen era this is an awfully contemporary dont blow my cover one of the cops says at one point in the book when wheeler attempts to write period dialogue he resorts to bad clichs or catch phrases that belong to the st century lazy writing i d say and unimaginative to boot the book is filled with laughable anachronisms and outright errors for example lady doyle was an occult she was a practitioner of automatic writing and a book was even published about her talks with her contact wheeler obviously is having fun with all real personalities of the period but i was getting tired of the overpopulation of real people and how they all seemed to have interchangeable personalities and their contemporary attitudes were increasingly annoying it seemed like he couldn t create any fictional characters of his own he fails miserably as a novelist the book is really screenplay disguised as a novel plenty of snappy and hip dialogue an overabundance of action sequences lots and lots of gore and violence but a novel no there have been countless books using doyle and houdini as detectives of sorts the list of seven is far better than this book and the novels of daniel stashower that feature houdini and his brother hardeen are immensely better wheeler really doesn t know much about his subjects but slides in so many references he thinks he does and he thinks he can fool his readers as well however anyone who has read in depth biographies and or the letters of these people doyle lovecraft and houdini knows that these men are much more interesting and colorful than the caricatures to which wheeler has reduced them 
an attempted read perhaps i expected more from this book than was present but i could hardly get through the first few chapters and i am an avid historic biography reader i found her methods tiresome and boring having the preference to recite found facts rather than compile and share she reads like a card catalog i now know exactly what to read if i do wish to learn something of these women she eludes to but after having put this book down i feel i am less wise to the subjects then when i started i need a chronological telling of a person and their movement not a forty three page explanation of exactly who has written such things in the past perhaps i stopped reading three or four chapters before it got good but i doubt it i was very disappointed 
i was also disappointed i have used lp guides to travel all over the world and this was a major disappointment i won t dispute that randall s peffer has spent the last years getting to know puerto rico as the book claims he knew it very well it seems when he wrote the first edition when he went back however in october to update the book i got the feeling that he may have meandered by locales he had mentioned to ensure the building was still standing not confirming any of the facts he had originally included on his way to drink quotcielito lindos quot at the friend s house who invented them and has never shared the recipe with any other bar on the island contrary to peffer s statement that this is the national cocktail we had a good time despite randall peffer s sloppy updating by the way the quotaphrodisiacquot restaurant in old san juan is called quotostracosaquot a play on words quotostraquot means oyster quototra cosa quot means quotanother thing quot the pun was lost on peffer despite his fluent borricua spanish 
fairly useless book the maps were available to look at but most of the events or special items that were denoted were impossible to discern from the text as far as a walk through goes i felt that the missing pieces of information were fairly aggravating ooo i found a box with a trap and a puzzle that appears to be based on information that is not available to me what does the guide say about it nothing here s a list of bounties i can collect how much are each worth can i negotiate higher ones what is the best way to persuade people already i want to toss the dumb thing in the waste basket 
barely relevant mr ferrazzi ignores the distinct advantage that he has had throughout his career he is an ivy league grad while i found some of his insights to be helpful he glosses over his educational background as though he presumes that all of his readers come from privileged upbringings while he attempts to diffuse his obvious advantages by opening with a discussion of his working class roots mr ferrazzi loses steam on the very next page writing about all of the the great schools he attended and the fact that he caddied at a country club caddying at a country club is not a degrading confidence busting job for a kid working as a cashier at cvs is how does the cvs kid network his way out in one point in the book mr ferrazzi creates a lot of build up about an event he attended and how much anxiety he felt the big denouement was that he had a connection through yale this is not compelling i was expecting him to have had to actually overcome something there are some good insights in the book but few that i hadn t heard before i m not sure that this book has shed any light on anything aside from the advantages of belonging to ivy league networks 
outdated thy name is the crying of lot so being a fan of all forms of literature more specifically challenging faulkner pretentious dh lawrence and original kafka works i was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what s considered pynchon s most imporant work important years ago perhaps but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one oh man the radio station is kcuf boy that s incredibly clever i bet it s like something spelled backwards i fully understand what pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs among other things all while giving us a story with no particular plot no moral no message i can understand it but it doesn t mean it s worth my time i didn t even finish it i read about half and then just dropped it to the floor ive read in numerous reviews of haruki murakami s work that he s a latter day japanese pynchon i don t agree murakami s ability to create a surreal dream like atmosphere is amazing pynchon is a hack 
stephen king was my teen years i d read most of king s stuff during the uh decade of my ute salem s lot and pet cemetery being the hook on the line and the stand shining christine and it reeling me in i thought he d never come out with a book that i didn t want to read cept anything of or related to his wife s stuff and the gunslinger series then one day i started to read insomnia and i couldn t make it to the halfway point the antichristian proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and i found myself throwing insomnia away i did that with cider house rules by john irving too even needful things with it s anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti catholism and hypocrisy but insomnia was just plain mean spirited 
i m trying to think of something good to say i can t find anything good to say about this book i agree that it s tedious boring and a waste of money i put it down and picked it up and then asked myself why closed it up and put it up i was going to sell it here but everyone else who tried to read it beat me to it it s not even worth the 
this book should be classified under historical fiction this book is one goofy rumor after another with hardly any verifiable sources epstein goes crazy throwing out every possible conspiracy idea around he actually states that hammer financed al gore s college education and that the whole gore family were his servants if you love the quotx files quot you will love this book 
poor scholarship i have often enjoyed this author s work however this time i believe that the author uses her evangelical christianity to mask unexamined prejudices i believe that in this book the author uses holy scripture and psuedo intellectual gloss rather than rigorous scholarship to discuss race gender sexuality and the church i find her arguments on sexuality shamefully dismissive i hope that the author will reconsider this work 
tired j lee grady s ten lies the church tells women how the bible has been used to keep women in spiritual bondage is as the title says very freeing demoss on the other hand left me tired of the same ol same ol about women the premise that there are lies all people believe is true enough but to focus on women being decieved specifically is well old tried and boring ie all have fallen short of the glory of god so what s the point who s first please women are not more easily decieved has anyone read about jael deborah abigail and paul s co workers euodia syntyche in telling others the good news or pricilla her name comes first as the principle leader and aquilla more recently amee simple mcphereson anne hutchinson gladys alward and many other women brought forth teachings of salvation by faith and bold new churches and ministries let me punctuate this by saying god chose to work huge miracles through those women and chooses to work miracles through women today not the least of miracles is that these women overcame the patriarchal weights and followed their god given passion and today s women can also demoss misses the point that women too are made in the image of god not man s image all are subject to christ alternatively i recommend if you dare for an educated solidly biblical challenge loren cunningham s book why not women i bought copies loren cunningham is the founder director of ywam who has i surmise placed more women missionaries oversees than any other christian organization so he may be one to whom you may want to give at least a polite listen scriptural exegisis is by the co author david hamilton please dont construe this to be saying you have to agree with cunningham hamilton but any one who is honestly facing the challenge of examining women s roles and open to examining how greek and roman mindsets tainted bible interpretation throughout the church age duh will come out with some real good tools to recognizing gnositic thinking and greek thinking that warp the scriptures and are the real deception in the church age when david hamilton examines the roots of the deceptions men read patriarcy have taught women you can see clearly god s heart in the original texts in both testaments is for the equal use of the gifts and lives of women if it is scriptural truth that is the question in your own heart then you owe it to yourself to check out this very well researched book demoss has good points for both genders on disappointments and unrealized expectations but a bible commentator she is not everyone should just calm down a bit and read a broader spectrum on this discussion before firing biblical pot shots read from other respected christian men and women and we can reason together indeed how to interpret the scriptures correctly kuddos to cunningham hamilton for a brillant and long overdue work i understand loren cunningham who has been married to his wife darlene years is writing his next book dealing directly with the issue of women in marriage and relationships i can t wait i ll be buying copies then i ll send one to nancy demoss maybe then she ll feel free to get married for the first time after being single for years 
unpleasant reading after minutes of reading i just couldn t take epstein s self absorbed writing style anymore when buying i really wanted to like this book 
the pc version of the end of the world max brooks has written a must have history for romero or just zombie fans every where unfortunately while the story starts off strong it soon dribbles into a series of disjointed and occasionally pointless vignettes it would be a difficult tale for anyone to carry given the format that brooks has chosen to use a large number of first person accounts of the near take over of the world by the stumbling zombie hordes there s no single narrative string for the audience to follow and no heroes with which the reader can identify i found myself eventually becoming bored with the different ways that max s characters described the zombies there s only so many ways to say undead to make up for the essential sameness of the story line in every individual short story max begins to increasingly rely on overblown rhetoric for example a chain smoking military veteran recovering in a psychiatric ward breaks out of semi literate street slang to describe zombie heads popping like kristal corks far from being effectively descriptive it becomes a distraction that made me start looking for more examples of excessive hyperbole i think the book would have held up better if in addition to the large number of independent accounts max had found a way to weave a single unifying thread giving his audience some one to root for and a reason to keep reading a difficult but not impossible task and max brooks appears to have the talent needed to pull such a task off but the lack of heroes or even characters most readers can identify with makes this a book with no compelling reason to finish you can stop on one page flip at random through the book start reading again and never feel like you ve lost your place and speaking of heroes this is really a minor complaint but once you ve figured it out it begins to annoy max s characters are all of a type a pc type that is such heroes as the various stories allow are divided into sympathetic and non sympathetic groupings the sympathetic most effective characters are all minorities women or handicapped the non sympathetic least effective characters are all white and male his bias goes so far that there s not a single heroic cop survivalist nra member or even effective military unit the president of the united states sympatheticminority is contrasted against the vice president unsympatheticwhite by citing many instances of the great president s wise guidance while the vice president is simply described as the wacko im not saying that it s impossible for the world to be saved by any particular group it s max s book and he can take the tale where ever he wants but it s so transparently obvious a bias that once you figure it out you find yourself mentally forecasting the characters entirely independently of their stories it s a stretch and distracts from what could have been a more balanced and more interesting tale as a result all that said i started out by saying that tome is a musthave for romero loving dead heads like me and i stand by that statement for all it s rambling plot and hyper kinetic speech it s still the best new installment in the zombie pantheon for many a day i predict great success in it s admittedly limited demographic 
for those who like this kind of book if you think you d find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting then you ll enjoy this book 
entirely awful book great expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written i m no dickens expert but i do know a little about literature i don t know how this even passed through the editing stage it is slow paced boring pointless and an all out waste of time to read i have read challenging books with strong points like this before and have sometimes enjoyed them but never have i read a book this pointless and difficult to read with such a stupid ending dont waste your money and valuable time on it 
bad book this was the worst book i have ever read it was so boring i have never spent so much money on such a stupid book i can t believe that anyone would say that they liked this book and i really wouldn t recomend anyone else buying or reading it ! 
couldn t finish first of all i must say i did not finish the book despite its minimal size i began reading this book because i am very interested in art history and reading historical fiction this novel is based on vermeer s painting the music lesson i found very few references to vermeer at all in the novel and was very bored with the story line granted i did not read all the way to the finish but i was so bored with the story thus far i couldn t 
let s act like we have something to hide what does it mean when someone gets excessively defensiveit doesn t express that they have peace or comfort with themselves writing sludge like this just fuels the fire that i suppose they are trying to put out if there was ever a fire 
horribly muddled this is one of the most horribly muddled thrillers i ve ever read by the end i wasn t sure who was winning or losing nor did i really care clive better quit sub contracting out his writing he should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on dirk pitt 
declining significance of race the book has a compelling argument because many of us would like to think that racism is a thing of the past it takes away the responsibility from people to end racial inequality because racism is no longer the cause i agree with wilson that class inequality is bad and that it does impact african americans however there is a store of research showing that racial discrimination still plays a real solid role in the continued marginalization of blacks you would be hard pressed to find an african american who has not experienced racism while the book is not devoid of scholarship it needs to be approached with caution be critical of what you would like to be the case and seek out what is trully the case 
save your money this book is too generic and full of platitudes plus poor grammar and typos the sloppy editing gets worse at the end of the book for anyone over who has ever done martial arts there is nothing new here for anyone who is just beginning in their s or later it is okay but not great if you are into fitness or are even aware of your body and have anything resembling an active lifestyle you will be disappointed the first four chapters are a waste of space why fitness is good the fact that exercise diet and mental attitude contribute to health that most people over resist exercise because it is work and can hurt etc most of the rest of the book discusses the changes in fitness you can expect when you are older and tells you to keep your chin up and not give up even if tempted there is also not nearly enough specific information on how to compensate for various physical limitations due to injury etc that prevent a full range of motion for many older martial artists the only thing i found of value was chapter sparring a few recommendations on how to modify sparring technique to compensate for a loss of power speed flexibility and agility for the older martial artist most of it was fairly obvious circle away from your opponent to avoid being hit ! but there was some good info about disrupting the fight rhythm and using a few simple techniques that you know well and that work for your particular body the book finishes with some guidance on meditation and mind body connection a good final chapter would have been how to know when to call it quits and stop training for good or at least change styles to something easier on the body like tai chi if i had glanced through this at barnes and noble i would not have bought it you can have mine 
not as good as it sounds this book is fun to read yes no question about that the problem are the facts inside in the first pages i found the first error i continued but without knowing if what i was reading was true for example mr comfort in page states it was another years later at a time when science believed that the earth was flat that the scriptures inspired christopher columbus to sail around the world well the problem is that first columbus wasn t inspired by scriptures and second in those times people didn t believe that the earth was flat i am a christian and i m very disappointed mr comfort s efforts to find evidence of modern science modern hygiene and even dinosaurs in the bible are simply unbelievable and many times feels forced he even quotes famous people on the bible i mean if napoleon said anything good about the bible that is a proof of is supernatural origin he founds what his eyes want to find he understands what he wants to understand the worst is that he sees things that are not there and compares it to data that is wrong the result is a fun but messy book 
did a six year old write this this is the first patterson novel i have ever read and it is certain to be the last most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in depth characters but patterson does none of that the author s writing style is akin to that of a small child s as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one dimensional characters patterson then holds the reader s hand as he matter offactly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation presenting a book written by a ralph wiggums like child for immature children to enjoy how does the reader know alex was scared the reader knows because patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style the man pulled out a gun alex was scared alex shot the man and he was happy and the man was dead dont believe me simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare i had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who i thought he killed or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist s evil deeds quite simply this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs 
very disappointing this is the story of cassie who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young indian policeman who just arrived in la cassie suffers from amnesia and we don t know what brought her there until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife this is by far the most disappointing of picoult s books and i ve read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers cassie is amnesic yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened the story goes back and forth between the present the past the memories and leaves readers lost in the middle i was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion what is frustrating is that it takes picoult pages to make her character realise the obvious i also found cassie to be unreliable and unappealing let alone her husband alex a massive egocentric the story was very confused mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in africa with anthropology indian legends domestic violence alcoholism amnesia it was just too much for one book and the message was confused if you want a superb story of domestic violence read black blue by anna quindlen if you want a good picoult book read the pact or my sister s keeper but definitely not picture perfect 
lots of footnotes but not enough cutsey and annoying writing wrapped around appealing but ultimately empty ideas nimmons made comparisons when it supported his opinion but when it wouldn t he didn t the world probably doesn t need another brutal critique of gay men most of what larry kramer said long ago still holds but this attempt to prove him wrong without deigning to plainly state that intent completely backfires 
would not recommend not what i expected studying angels in bible study this book too vague and not all backed up by scriptur 
who s the real quotmr boring quot i have read this book through and through and i have read the brief review pannning the book and the response by the author eugene taylor i had two reactions first i found the author s quotrebuttalquot rather spooky it was a mean spirited response not at all polite or dare i say spiritually enlightened although the author hints at his own ability to see into the great beyond and to know more than the rest of us who are not blessed with such experiences he is apparently thin skinned and perhaps after i read this book i now see that he has reason to be which brings me to my second point my review of the book i found myself in total agreement with the reviewer from lincoln mass i m sorry to say this but the book is boring and repetitive and offers a thesis that is not very original at all i have read many books on the history of new age spirituality and this is just so so 
just so so of the or so grisham novels ive read this one is my least favorite its not a bad story at all but it s just way too long about pages longer than it needed to be it also just lacked credibility in many spots grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible if not really interesting most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that ive always thought were fascinating this book however plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work the other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for mark sway the year old protagonist he sounds more like a street wise year old using words like wonderful and phrases that have been out of use since the s i think grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters this isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
intelligent but dated this book examining the war between russia and its breakaway republic chechnya is a product of great expertise and tremendous thoroughness the war is examined from all angles in great detail furthermore author anatol lieven has an affecting writing style when he relates his personal experiences among the chechens but things are still unsettled in the former soviet union and events have overtaken this book new wars have broken out in ways and in places that call lieven s theories which were based on the best information available at the time into question for the person who needs to know the current zeitgeist in the former soviet republics this book is too dated to be of much use while for those who are interested in the russia chechnya war as a historical subject are going to have to wait until the region settles before a definitive account can be written this is a good book from a thoughtful talented and well informed author but the lapse of time has rendered it unfit for its purpose 
scary the author illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children s books and my son of years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them it teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy i love that this book comes in boardbook form but i am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
the horror the horror that was pretty much how i felt after finishing this terrible book im a buffy fan something of a purist as i don t like the angel spin off and only an occasional reader of btvs novels which except for the lost slayer always disappointed me they were like mcdonalds food good to have around when buffy s not on tv but never satisfying so when i saw this novel i thought it would be good holder is a four times bram stoker award winner and i figured the first novel set after the climax of the btvs tv show would be of a much higher quality than previous novels to satisfy the btvs fans who want the story to continue but i was very wrong this book is absolutely god awfulid give it zero stars if i could its hard to pick on thing that makes this book so bad unscary and cliched villains regular buffy characters acting out of character since when does oz give speeches terrible dialogue unrealistic and with none of the wit or intelligence that s the hallmark of the tv show the yet another apocalypse plot something which whedon and co acknowledged was a cliche when the tv shows were running within the shows storylines ignoring the continunity set up by the final series of angel during which this book is set unless the worldwide apocalyptic weather systems featured in this book decided to skip la and no one at wolfram and hart thought to tell angel a hellmouth in cleveland has opened borderline racist characterisation of non americans all italians speak a like a this a and are obsessed with clothes while girls from indian are all shy and hide behind veils and there s the uncountable number of unnamed new slayers who are casually slaughtered it seems a new slayer has a shorter life expectancy than a red shirted officer in star trek but the worst thing about this book are the events holder skips battle scenes action sequences and major dramatic events she set up earlier in the book they re just skipped and you re told the result of what happened for example early in the book buffy and co encounter a pack of shapeshifters and go out hunting doesnt have any bearing on the main plot only i think they do because holder skips the entire hunt buffy and co discover the monsters turn the page the critters are all dead the same thing is repeated again and again and again big set up expectation raised of major drama action scenes turn the page and the events already in the past sometimes by days admittedly btvs jumps around genres with wild abandon but action is a major part of the series and the novels something that holder either doesn t want to handle or can t write so skips even major events in the story including the final battle are skipped the only good thing about this book is twist at the very end which completes the journey to adulthood arc whedon and co have been running since the start of season of btvs however its execution makes me think holder got her idea from reading buffy slash fiction and too many reports of angels visiting the dying in hospitals only btvs fans would buy this book but they ll end up hating it in my view holder took the publisher s money handed in a first draft and then legged it that all said i found this book inspirational because after reading it i thought i can write a better novel than this piece of junk ! if you re a btvs fan avoid this book and spend your money on the new buffy comic coming from dark horse it s buffy the vampire slayer season written by joss whedon 
hate it and love it i hardly know how to describe this book when i read it two years ago my hatred for pamela the character was something of an amusing obsession although richardson had meant to portray a model of feminine virtue pamela is vain conniving self righteous wordy and obnoxiously weak i cannot think of a more annoying character in literature uriah heep lydia bennett newland archer all are more tolerable than pamela i find myself rooting for pamela s ruin to top everything off pamela s great reward for maintaining her virtue is a marriage to the man who had so many times tried to rape her as a husband mr b is temperamental and demanding and this is virtue rewarded even by th century standards the idea was thought absurd by many such as henry fielding who wrote parodies shamela and joseph andrews yet despite all this the book is at times entertaining if for all the wrong reasons and pleasantly sentimental i admit i hate it and love it i searched and searched to find pamela part ii yes richardson actually did write a sequel so far it promises to be just as frustrating as part i ! 
fairytaleaficcionado interesting well documented with marvelous illustrations definitely a good buy for adults who still dream of fairy tales characters it is a pity that the collection does not include stories from one thousand and one nights otherwise it will be perfect and complete 
read the book skip the audio version i am reviewing the audio version of the book i would give this zero stars if i could only because of the narration as usualy dave barry is very funny but it doesn t come through in this version because it s impossible to get past the narrator s reading in a word he is awful he sounds like a combination between a bad paul harvey impersonator and the adult voice of ralphie in quota christmas story quot his timing and inflection are totally wrong for the material and he completely ruins the whole book i couldn t get through one of the five cds before i wanted to throw the thing out the window it would have been great if they had used someone like harry anderson who played a fictionalized version of dave on tv a few years ago to read this and then perhaps barry s humor would have come through if you like dave barry skip the audio book and read the paper version 
disappointed this book looked promising when i picked it up but after struggling through the instructions i now regret buying it i bought the book to learn right angle weave but ended up looking up a free tutorial online instead because i could not figure out christine prussings instructions and examples the right angle weave stitch itself is actually not that complicated but christine makes it seem extremely complicated unless you are really good with a compass i do not recommend this book i started a beautiful project that she had on the front cover but once you get done with the base of the piece her instructions become unclear and confusing now i have a beautiful unfinished necklace 
paul and roman mithraism per the editorial review in his own writings paul draws from mithraic vocabulary and symbolism thats interesting considering the earliest roman mention of mithras was by statius ca ad and modern scholarship places the earliest known roman mithraic bull slaying monument to ca ad see richard gordon the date and significance of cimrm british museum townley collection jms and paul was dead by then if this author was using the outdated work of cumont to develop this untenable theory well that s simply embarrassing the controversial theory of david ulansey offers no earlier concrete evidence either as all he has to go on is the second hand or made up account of plutarch who connects the roman cult with some cilician pirates ca bc but beyond this unsubstantiated literary reference the only concrete evidence for the roman cult appears in the latter part of the st century ad after paul had flourished 
not very helpful after the first chapter had i realized that this book was less about business and more about this man s faith i would not have bothered he seems to need constant reassurance that gd is ok with us making money the theme becomes redundant and not terribly helpful i doubt that he will ever becoe a billionaire but please let me know if he does 
i regret buying this book i m tearing my hair out trying to finish this book but it s slow going because the book is so badly written it s like reading some third graders book report and i m stunned because the author is a scholar and her subject matter is so interesting mostly now i m just using the book to compile a list of historical figures i d like to research futher thats really the draw of this book yalom has done a great deal of sweeping research bringing together a huge number of primary sources from around the world mixing physical artifact literary works and historical record together to create her argument i just can t get over how terribly it s presented the book itself is also formatted in a ridiculous manner with generic curlicues and fleurs delys everywhere the formatting just serves to underscore how disconnected and spasmodic the narrative is i think i would be happy to have come apon this book in a library and spent an hour or two taking notes out of it but it s definitely not going to find a permanent place on my shelf 
interesting subject poorly written although it was a chore to overlook the poor writing the stories were interesting however because the writing was so poor especially from someone so well educated i can t help but doubt the author s credibility 
outdated i returned this book after opening the cover and scanning the contents if you are looking for help with computer based recording this is not it 
for musicians only i am a moderate guitar player with a hamburg type rickenbacker guitar and wanted to learn a little more about the guitar cords used in beatle songs i am not afraid to tell that i don t understand anything if you haven t learned music theory for at least some years at school this book could be a dissapointment for you as it turned out to be for m 
pages of reader suffering this novel started out pretty good in that i didn t know where koontz was going with martie s panic attacks and fear of herself it seemed to take forever for anything to actually happen the antagonist was a caricature so over thetop it was a job getting through each page if this had been my first koontz novel i probably wouldn t bother with a second 
mediocre i read this book it was okay but the story flashed back to much and i couldn t folow all of it but i read all of it anyway i wouldn t recommend it too slow moving and boring because of the flashbacks the movie was the same way 
this book rocks because i found this book to be very good the reason i thought this was because it has a great story line of mystery adventure and action it also has a great them to it the theme came out to me as that you can t hang over something for a long time because if you do it will only drive you insane adn make you mad at yourself and the world i thought that this book was good and all but i could nt really focus on it after about pages so i read around a chapter or two every other night or so the easiest aprt for me to read was toward the end of the book because thats when it got really exciting and the mystery startd to unfold i think that this book is excellent for anyone who enjoys mystery stories this book is also i think good for teenagers because this story is fiction but a situation like this book could very well happen to any teenagers life 
amusing but completely unreliable this fat volume about food and cooking packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories is amusing but completely unreliable as a source of information about the history of food it is useless many of the assertions of fact here are questionable and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out the author seems to have taken snippets from here and there mostly apparently from french sources sorted them thematically and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text no doubt a large proportion of the assertions here are true but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others whats more the translation is poor not only are some gallicisms rendered word forword and so only intelligible if you translate them back into french but there are no translator s notes for topical references i cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food 
questionable claims and an impractical way to eat if your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power then maybe this plan is right for you but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy ie nuts avocados fish oil even butter gasp he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell ! i ve never heard of this phenomenon i refuse to believe it and physiologically it doesn t make sense the only reason i gave this book one star is because of his advocation to whole foods which are unprocessed contrary to what one anti ornish reviewer said it s in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives many people in europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two and that is a good thing ! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives the better off you are eating it long story short if your protein needs aren t large and you don t have an insulin sensitivity problem then you may lose fat and become a bit healthier on this diet otherwise just make an effort to eat foods in moderation it s as simple as that ! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren t hard to live without and don t eat any more than you need to to reach satiety 
broad but not deep i used this book when i took the rf circuit design class at cornell the experience with this book was devastating it did not give me any good detail of any single rf circuit i am not sure what kind of background the author expected but i am sure that this book is not a good choice for a beginner and if you got a ph d in rf design why do you wanna read a magazine version of an rf design 
not recommended as primary lsat study guide if you d really like to learn about how the lsat questions are structured and if you have time to memorize the techniques suggested by the book then lsat workout could be helpful you however if you just want to practice and to get comfortable with the exam so to speak i d recommend getting the study guides with actual previous lsats instead try checking them out at the lsac org website note i started studying for the lsat with this book and then switched to the official practice tests lsat workout exaggerates the difficulty of the material using the book i noticed i had to keep re reading the passages before being able to decide on an answer and then would consequently keep exceeding time limits not to mention getting frustrated but i later found that the questions on the actual lsat were easier for me to work with in fact i ran out of time only once and i did better on the exam than i expected so if you re looking to do less reading and more practicing and only want one study guide opt for the official lsat preptests instead i have no way of showing whether my use of lsat workout had any effect on my score but i will say that discontinuing it s use had a lot to do with my calm confidence in taking the test 
fans of island of the blue dolphins stay away from zia longtime fans of scott o dells classic island of the blue dolphins do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel island of the blue dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid i must ve read it at least a dozen times somehow i didn t find out that it had a sequel until years later intrigued by the idea of a sequel to island which kind of ends on a cliffhanger i read zia i was interested in seeing how scott o dell would handle what happens to karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for years as you probably know island of the blue dolphins was based on a true story but the facts are few about the real lost woman so how would the talented writer scott o dell concoct what happens to karana the result zia is terribly disappointing for starters fans of karana won t have much to read about at least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her the story is told completely from the niece s point of view we never get to hear what karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone we learn almost nothing about what happened to karana s father and sister just that her sister s children have ended up orphans in a missionary and sadly there s nothing interesting about karana s niece zia and her brother they merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper thin story out over pages or so i now appreciate the cliffhanger ending of island of the blue dolphins in its perfect simplicity it is better to leave the story when karana leaves the island and let it be your own imagination about what it was like for karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in zia i wish i could erase zia from my mind zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written 
and now a lean dictionary this pricey little x spiral bound listing of lean manufacturing terms lean enterprise style is a good and the only one that i know of compilation of the japanese lanquage terms of lean manufacturing replete with diagrams it is a great reference for all the lean wanna be s and is great for settling lean terminology bets but it is far too shallow a reference to appreciably improve your knowledge of lean manufacturing 
don t weigh down your luggage with this book this book is more of a storey book than a guide to use when you are in florence i went to one gelateria and two caffe s out of this book and all weren t that great more tourist traps than hidden gems i wish this book would give some idea of prices because a few of the places we checked out but didn t order had ridiculous prices if you want a wonderful food guide to florence check out emily wise millers food lover s guide to florence it is excellent 
pompous wannabe adventurer doctor kamler makes me want to puke this pompous arrogant wannabe adventurer writes like he is gods gift to high adventure maybe being the onsite doctor is an excuse for not summiting perhaps a more noble pursuit would be to help innocent people that are injured without being self destructive in my opinion there is nothing more dangerous than a pompous arrogant doctor that fancies himself the guru of high adventure medical treatment go back to being a hand surgeon you 
forgettable italo chiller international noir hits rock bottom with one of the latest outing of this midlist italian author a wannabe psychothriller almost blue could only satisfy the staunchest defenders of old whodunits what with its trite plot and its absolute contempt for logic and the less said about the writing style the better is this all italy got to offer we shudder at the mere thought 
keep your money honey big boom said everything he had to say in the title of the book the rest of the book looks good on the outside but is very empty on new revelation poor editing repeating statements rambling on from tangent to tangent take your and carry a little old lady to starbucks and get the same information plus you will be doing a good deed 
christian marxist i was excited to read this book as it is on the reading list for a theology course at wheaton college it didn t take me long to figure out walsh and keesmaat are theologians who like to write from a new perspective that is really the same old political liberalism of the left they just don t get it after reading their views on the us military their praise of food coops and their negative comments about coroporate america i am surprised they do not teach at berkeley on the left coast the gospel really is simple they make it synonymous with the liberal agenda 
disappointing i had high hopes for this book as i thought it would address spirituality in a humanistic way at first i thought i agreed with the accepting of self philosophy but gradually statements made by the author just didn t ring true i kept on thinking that maybe i was resistant to the reevaluation of my own thought processes but gave up when the author spoke of a patient who found out her husband was cheating on her and the author s response was that she had control issues and was acting like a victim i think at that moment perhaps she feeling victimized but instead of telling her to embrace her victim she is a control freak then he presents depression like it is some kind of choice instead of a chemical imbalance perhaps depression can spawn creativity but you have to be able to get out of bed first and that is a problem i gave up on the book after that 
disappointment i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title i read this book because it was the subject of an on line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group 
it didn t work for me either i too read this book cover to cover with high hopes for success i took notes and paid extra attention on how to perform each technique when a particular therapy had more than one technique i tried the first with no improvement and worked my way onto the next and still i saw nothing i got no immediate results as promised and no results still i ve been very disappointed with this book 
for sell side analysts only i bought this book based on the strong reviews as a complement to damodaran s classic on valuation but felt disappointed to qualify my comments first i am not a sell side analyst and secondly i haven t finished the book after about pages i threw in the towel my first stylistic objection to the book is its low content density there is tremendous repetition and examples are trotted out in excruciating detail even where the conclusions are fairly obvious for example on p at competitive equilibrium the firm can identify no incremental investment opportunities likely to generate returns in excess of capital costs competitive equilibrium is often defined as a condition in which investment opportunities generate returns equal to capital costs but existing investments continue to earn abnormal rates to me these two sentences are already redundant but in case you still didn t get it further down on the same page this situation is called economic equilibrium or economic parity what does equilibrium mean when returns are forced down to capital costs then economic rents and or abnormal earnings disappear and no further incentive to enter the business exists but the most frequently repeated point of the first two chapters is best summed up on p as i say many times in the coming pages and he s not kidding there equity analysis is not prophecy it s opinion it was never meant to be objective description but it is strong advocacy if you re the sell side analyst having to dress up a pig to help your firm gain some banking business this book might offer some ideas but where does this leave the consumer of such analysis its the investor s job to diversify by considering a variety of analysts positions pi think better advice for the investor might be to learn how to perform sound analysis themselves for that i recommend damodaran s book i lost my faith in this book s intent to provide balanced let alone predictive analysis 
some textbook this is the longest textbook i have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that i know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations but the book was too detailed and wordy for me many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding but this book doesn t do that it is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise straightforward text a really good book is investment science by david luenberger although his text assumes you have some background in calc statprobability theory the writing examples and organization is far superior you ll actually begin to understand how investment really works without getting bogged down by the numbers terminology and jargon 
repetitive rehash i loved mr darcy takes a wife and didn t want to see it end so i was delighted to see another sequel by the same author unfortunately this one just continually rehashes previous material in slightly different ways the storyline jumps all over the place contradicts itself and does not feel cohesive perhaps better editing would have made this a worthwhile read while mr darcy takes a wife will find a permanent spot on my bookshelf days and nights at pemberley will not i do hope to see more from berdoll perhaps she should take on a sequel to the characters in emma 
not the most useful as a student of many books i can safely say that this offered less information on the subject title of any book i have read it has made me a little hesitant of new books unless i specifically know the author spend your money elsewhere 
not worth the money this book seems hopelessly out of touch with black culture and us culture in general it also seems to be pandering to people who want to believe the nation of islam is not different than hitler and the nazis ! how simplistic ! if you really want to understand race and how to do away with racism give this book a pass 
for once the movie is better than the book gabriel noone is a year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at pm he s upset because his lover of years has left because he needed space into his life comes a book written by year old pete lomax although it took him years to write the book and he began it when he was so he should be at least about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to pete has been listening to gabriel s show and admires him very much well gabe calls up little pete and begins a friendship he tells pete all his personal problems and pete sympathizes and gives him advice later he begins to doubt pete s existence because no one has ever seen him he lives with his adoptive mom donna sometimes she s a phd psychologist and sometimes she s a psychiatrist md according to gabe anyway gabe also has a lot of issues with his dad which are neatly resolved by the end the movie version goes into much more depth and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding donna motives without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on gabe s agenda its unlikely that anyone would believe that a year old boy would listen to npr or even know what it was much less have the patience to listen to a grown man s whining about his love life see the movie 
extremely dull jensen s biography of schumann is a merely adequate portrayal of this most extraordinary composer the prose is incredibly flat and repetitive the quotinsightquot that schumann loved children hardly original considering the quotkinderszenenquot and quotalbum fur die jugend quotis made several times though any further elucidation is avoided another glaring failure of the book is the lack of musical analysis after spending far too much time on the youthful quotpapillonsquot jensen practically ignores such ground breaking works as the quotgesange der fruhe quot and the eerily gorgeous quotgeistervariationenquot often such works receive only a curious aside such as quotdense texture quot and the like altogether an unsatisfying read 
ouch barber is painfully boring and his views are over the top liberal read it for school and would not wish reading this on my worst enemy 
scholarly ramblings this is a difficult book to evaluate its author is obviously a bright scholar and the book itself comes from an invited memorial lecture at the seabury western theological seminary in there is lots of good material here about nd century christian beliefs and quotations from many sources that can be hard to track down but it is difficult to know what the author is up to there is no apparent structure nor theme he seems to jump from one topic to another with no segue each pericope is perfectly good by itself but there is no cumulative effect even more problematic the documentation is poor and the bibliography is incomplete this book may have made a very good lecture but it doesn t survive as a meaningful book nonetheless the material herein is very valuable and the book may be of interest to scholars of early christianity who are interested in the works of marcion valentinus ignatius irenaeus etc 
know where your information is coming from i have not read this book i stumbled across the listing on amazon and looked at it so i can t actually comment as to the comments but i want people to realize that the publisher is listed as the john birch society a very right wing fringe group that among other things in its history was against the civil rights movement look them up on wikipedia or something if you want more information i just wanted to let people who are not familiar with the jbs know who was responsible for publishing this 
historical perspectives politcal messages gay talese s work on his family s journey from italy to america is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the united states and italy revolution social upheaval racism and war color talese s story from start to finish these themes give the tale a characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places in addition there is a decided social message which the author appears to be trying to put forth during the entire story these perspectives and those on italian history should be viewed in the context of interpretations of an italian american writer and not be taken as those of traditional native italian scholars still the book is in a bold attempt at telling the story of one family s struggle on both sides of the atlantic during the social upheaval of the twentieth century 
boring don t get me wrong i do enjoy card s writing especially his uh enderverse i loved ender s game i absolutely adored speaker for the dead i m reading xenocide and i love what i ve read and i liked ender s shadow i don t like shadow of the hegemon though its nothing but boring long and tedious talk about politics also card doesn t seem to understand how much the world would have changed in years i don t know i seem to like card better when he s writing about philosophy not politics 
terrible this book starts of interesting however the book goes on and on and on about scenarios involving people over the phone it rarely mentions person to person or online scams the book suggested solutions to preventing social engineering attacks is really poor i enjoyed the book for a few days but its really same old all the way through many of the stories read like hack philes you can find on the net full of lies and waffle you will find your self bored of the book there are plenty of copies of it on e bay for a reason buy it for sentiment only and because its black i can t believe its by mitnic 
flawed alternate history to qualify as an alternate history there must be a critical point which results in a completely different future the problem that i had with this book is that the point chosen to diverge from actual historical events is so inconsequential that other than a few battles which only a historian would be acquainted with the reader is hard pressed to know or care about the alternate outcome in addition this book lacks the scope or vision which one usually expects from this type of work it reads like a college history book peopled with a few characterizations of the people of the time from a historical perspective the only really interesting character is a minor player compared to the other historical personalities which are mentioned finally this work appears to be only the first of several designed to drag the reader through a tedious serialization which only a scholar intimate with the minute details of native american history could appreciate 
good on process low on recipe s the book covers the process of smoking well good information on brining sausage making and processing smoked foods is provided it lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats a few recipes are presented but this is not a cookbook 
rubbish read thomas sowell s this guy is a civil rights movement making a living off of divisive racist dialogue the blame for slavery depends on the perspective one takes and how you categorize or label the wrongdoers i e was it whites that promulgated slavery because most if not all in power at the time were white or was it democrats since they were most strongly in favor of prolonging the institution of slavery or maybe the group to be blamed should be property owners since they wielded the most power and stood the most to gain in the continuation of slavery or perhaps we should blame the farmers as a class since they owned the plantations and as such we should seek reparations from today s farmers or hey let s pin the blame on people of british descent since the majority of settlers in america at the time were of that lineage in reality the blame for transgressions against individual rights should as always be rightly assigned to government if you re looking for a consistent pattern of egregious failings one that doesn t isn t vulnerable to subjective biases then government is the culprit alas as governments of old are long gone and to levy compensatory or punitive judgments against any current government would simply be transferred to its innocent citizens the reparation solution is quite simply a dead issue for an interesting take on who s to blame for blacks relative failure to compete and succeed in this country read thomas sowell s black rednecks and white liberals it offers also a very enlightening discussion of the true scope of slavery and the minimal impact that american slavery had when seen in this broad context 
too drawn out normally i don t take the time to write a review but this book just bugged me when i finished i felt like i had run a marathon the book was just too drawn out and i felt the descriptions were long winded faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem the plot was good but moved slowly i am typically not drawn to danielle steel books and probably with good reason that i never seem to like them very much i am glad that this book was in a box of books that i paid for at a used book store i would have felt like i wasted my money had i actually paid full price for it 
ok but need to know astral projection this book is fair it assumes you can astral project most of the advanced subjects are for use when you astral project the author is vague about many subjects and doesn t go into a lot of detail she tells you that you should read this book and that if you want to know more about what she s talking about i don t recommend this book because it doesn t seem advanced it just gives general information and doesn t get into more detail i was disappointed however it does have some info that is interesting 
too old to matter this book really should be removed from circulation while basic midi information is in there it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart photographs are all poor and dated the section on midi and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices get the picture if you are looking for charts of control codes etc they are in here but you can find those anywhere if you are trying to get information on midi in the last decade or so buy a different book 
scruton the apologist roger scruton is a polemical kind of philosopher in many ways similar in style to john searle when scruton does philosophy it s a joy to read but as others have complained the philosophy in this book is a frame for scruton to do christian apologetics if that s what one wants it s not a bad book personally scruton s christianity doesn t have much appeal for me and the philosophical issues can get sidelined if you re really interested in philosophy scruton s modern philosophy is a better place to look no christian apologetics just philosophy it s both an introduction and survey with scruton s usual acerbic comments personally the work is directed more toward intermediate philosophy readers than naive ones but as a general introduction and survey scruton does himself very well for a basic and broader introduction to philosophy robert solomon s introducing philosophy with original texts and commentary is certainly to be preferred but the price is outrageous 
borrrrrrrrrring when i picked up true believer i was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters neither panned out this book is boring the characters are one dimensional and there is no mystery too much detail and not enough substance not sure what the point of the story was as i didn t get it 
why do we care our hero amoral in his love life refusing to kick his unfaithful ex wife to the curb and making mystery solving boring why continue parker can write like no one else but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
the cover tells the whole story i m surprised no other reviewer noticed ! why did penquin place ronald colman and douglas fairbanks jr prominently on the cover in this reviewer s opinion they must secretly realize that the wonderful classic film vastly outshines the printed word i found the story to be poorly written and hard to follow its style is too formal too flowery and too wordy ! if i had not seen both versions of the film i could not have followed the action i constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself a review of pz boils down to a basic truth while most agree that the book is usually superior occasionally the movie wins out pz is a prime example strangers on a train is another as for the so called sequel rupert of hentzau don t even bother unless you are an anthony hope fanatic reviewing the book makes one appreciate once again that wonderful film fadeout as ronald colman rides off over the hill since it happens to be available on amazon click on the movie reviews therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of the prisoner of zenda 
not the great book people seem to think it is this is a book that could should have faded into history without being a great loss to the world yes there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy but they re far and few between and mainly either just thrown out as montesquieu s personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination or flimsily based on historical examples as a reader i didn t find most of his arguments where he didn t seem to be contradicting himself which happens frequently very convincing this was obviously written with the th century french salon crowd in mind and reads as such i m sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history he claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal well i did read the whole book and at the end couldn t see an overarching structure at all the work just seemed like a long rambling unorganized mess the only people i might really recommend this to are people interested in greek roman and french history especially legal history but not to people interested in political science or philosophy bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought there are much more interesting reads out there 
tasteless wholly unappetizing to put it in cookbook terms thematically ripped off from dobie gillis but without a whiff of the charm and interest of the original you really don t care about any of the characters introduced in this book stale ingredients make for a bland dish 
this book is bedlam the back cover to this book was intriguing and captured me immediately the writing however was so plodding so inconsistent and so non sequential that it was painful to get through to the end this is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day i can t believe that this book made it past the editors in one paragraph jon katz tells how rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet and in the next he says that rose is too young to herd sheep in one paragraph he can t live without his wife she gives his very existence meaning and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to what was it again oh right herd sheep ! at one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he can t connect to and finally gives away and then can t stop visiting even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog and why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys there s a reason jon if you care at all about literarure stay away from this book 
disappointing simon winchester s journey up the yangtze river is often poetic and overruns with historical detail every eddie of the way up the river if anything this is an incredible historical text of china the author s research is impeccable and undeniable however every word of the way through this book i couldn t help but feel a profound disappointment in what could have been but clearly is not one of the the most epic journeys of our time mr winchester s timing was perfect a trip up the yangtze before the three gorges dam would change it forever and as the country is experiencing a rebirth that will soon make it the largest economic superpower in the world where it is destined to stay for the next century yet with all his research all the planning and all the help he received along the way we re left with only a few hundred pages of text where are the thousands of pictures where are the video clips of his journey where is the interactive website he mentions in the opening pages that he packed a leica m camera but at least in the paperback edition there is not a single picture in the book from a man who successfully sued the defense department over the freedom of information action in order to get the pentagon s most detailed maps of the river i expected more instead we are left with a very long winded account of the author s journey but not a deserving account of china s journey 
weak and disappointing the description sounded promising but in fact this is one of the least well written books i ve read in a long time the prose iss stilted sentence fragments abound the style is that of a year old writing a travelogue complete with irrelevant details about every aspect of the author s daily routine harold truman has an unusual fondness for italics and puts quotation marks around the title of each chapter don t waste your time or your money on this book 
offers nothing new this book takes you instead of the manhunt for the washington area snipers but offers nothing that has not previously been reported in the washintgon post or other papers my hope is that after the trial the book will be updated or something else will be published that provides some insight into those issues 
awful wow where can i start this book was truly dreadful in pretty much every imaginable manner not only was the plot completely absurd and filled with glaring inconsistencies as already mentioned but was totally transperant in this type of book a little artistic license can be granted for the sake of a gripping storyline but this book offers nothing in the way of suspense the characters are ridiculous cardboard cutouts which do nothing to fix the book s predictability i ve never read any other of cussler s novels and now never will so i m not sure if his writing is always like this but here he seems to have little command of the english language his prose is drowning in mangled phrases overblown cliches and pointless technical jargon a travesty from start to finish don t waste your time on this book 
not a very good book i guess this wasnt the type of book for me it was boring not surprising and it felt like months had gone by since i started the book took me weeks to read if i hadn t had to read this for school i would ve never finished it 
huge disappointment after reading men who can t love which by the way is brilliant ! i was excited to pick up another piece by these authors unfortunately i was more than disappointed i should have seen a red flag when i saw the title so i have no one to blame but myself any woman who decides to like herself just so that a man can like her is sadly mistaken you like yourself for yourself not anybody else generalizations such as a balding man is a better catch than a hottie are simply put ignorant theory that a lengthy first phone conversation indicates problems in the relationship going forward is ridiculous half way through the book i came to conclusion that it was written for teenagers a couple of valid points surrounded by a whole lot of common sense rambling women who want to improve their self esteem should look elsewhere and finally who in the world thinks about babies on the first date 
highly disappointing if you are a fan of jane austen pride and prejudice and mr darcy in particular do not buy mr darcy s daughters i had to force myself to finish the book even while trying to keep an open mind and not expect it to be of the same caliber of pride and prejudice the story is weak the characters forgettable if i d read the reviews here first i wouldn t have bothered with the book there were many extraneous characters in the novel love interests develop late and with little or nothing to support them there are more references to sex than i think is in line with a sequel to a jane austen novel i also found it strange that any children of mr darcy let alone five of them would choose to show little regard for how their behavior affected their standing in good london society at least mr and mrs darcy are out of the country for the duration of the novel and are spared the humiliation of making an appearance in such a second rate piece of work 
lame sean hannity is a joke all of these pundits are we should dig a hole and push them all in then throw in a few starving tigers that would roc 
long on introduction short on strategies i enjoyed this book and very much empathized with the subject matter but was so surprized when the book just ended and i had not really learned much about further strategies in dealing with empathetic ability i was amazed that flower essences were the first strategy given by this professional but still trying to keep an open mind i was quite annoyed the book just ended and now i will need to search more for more advanced handling of this topic i would suggest that anyone who reads the book identifies with this trait has to remember that this ability is a great gift the best strategy i have found to accept live with and really enjoy this ability is to spend alot of time and effort in increasing your spiritual identities not religious spirituality is your relationship with god and religion is experienceing someone else s relationship with god quite a difference the flower essenses therapy i feel is a way to mute the empathy that needs to be accepted nurtured and not medicated out of your life i cannot imagine taking anything foreign that would mute this most precious gift like taking an anti depressant or anti anxiety pill sure if you can t handle this gift maybe you need these aids but once embraced you really can t get through the day without that wonderful guidance your own spirit is providing you so this book is ok for the beginning on their quest for self understanding but it certainly does not present enough strategies to help empathic veterans 
some style and no substance alan deutschman writes in quintessential gq style apple pixar next and jobs are given the cinematic attention brioni suits and designer clothing take precedence to the story telling theme ! that s precisely where the story ends neither apple s business environment nor the facts behind jobs renaissance garner attention ! steve s vendetta against the apple board that sacked him his bitterness about moving away from the company he helped create and his pre occupation with odwalla fruit juices black polo shirt amp blue jeans are the only facets of steve s character that deutschman manages to grasp talk is cheap deutschman manages to splice up this pathetic offering with additives ! steve s obsession with german design aesthetics his quottomfooleryquot with his corporate hobbies next pixar and apple are all touted by deuschman as tenets of a precipitous corporate personality ! jobs is portayed as a whip slashing mogul who just rides his quotilldeservedquot luck to the top he is credited with zero intelligence and a disgusting atttitude ! apparently next and pixar had no strategies and were quotbleedinghemorrhaging corporations quot a phrase deutschman uses with irritating regularity ! job s groundbreaking strategies to rev up the motorcade of new products at apple and next are promptly thrown out of the window ! his ability to turn small door companies like pixar into money making machines is rudely ignored the book is definitely based on hearsay and might as well be treated as a rag this man hardly knows what he is talking about 
not much useful information this book is not very useful its very simple and real advice is missing you learn more from prison life by wathing a good prison movie for example their only advice against the rapes is that you should fight back hard with all of your strenght well no s t sherlock this whole book is full of this kind of tips 
if only a vicar was a type of weapon and lo my children the lord said unto thee that wait a moment this is the modern age why am i talking like a medieval preacher maybe that s because the profoundly stupefying effect that the viccar of wakefield by oliver goldsmith had on me the story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages give or take a few pages depending on version the story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty a merchant steals all the money that viccar primrose has invested leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in wakefield the book continues and follows the family s trials and tribulations this book was extraordinarily hard to read i would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level english student and even then only at your own risk no words are in quotes the fourth wall is broken constantly and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything it is probably one of the hardest books i have ever read and i am a junior english major in college the characters are amazingly flat the plot has some redeeming qualities though the plot shows how the people of the time lived had fun and loved not to mention how mothers regarded their children the ending though was so contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had all in all this story was a waste of time if you want to learn how things worked in that age there are plenty of stories that are easier to read much more accurate and have less author interruption then this book its negatives greatly outweigh its positives so unless you have to read it stay away 
love me daddy a killer for a local mob boss who is also the goon s surrogate daddy kills his way through a long tedious book there is time out for a little love interest with a woman who understands and aids his need to sow lethal mayhem whenever his daddy tells him to bloody meaningless shootouts not fully explained continue as the miami mob trys to take over dads orlando territory our hero starts looking for dad who has gone missing with lethal results for scores of unknown and meaningless characters its a one dimentional tale that never caught my interest unless you enjoy keeping track on your abacus of an ever rising body count with no interesting tale attached give this one a bye for your own good life is too short to waste your time on books like this 
not funny i have read several of hiaasen s books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did 
less than enthralling i was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing in an quotadvice o the day quot format of tidbits of wisdom the wisdom offered is good mind you but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you eg on a long car ride you will likely be disappointed i can only listen to about or tidbits before i lose interest 
a tepid polemic this book uses a canon to kill a flea sympathetic as i am to the rhetorical and discursive analysis of cultural formations such a project requires depth and context to be intelligible this book lacks both it provides quick parachute drops into various aspects of discursively mediated marketeering strategies touching on discourse touching on the body and then hurries on to another example or arena without working through the consequences of the argument morever the style is ponderous enough to kill a child with lead poisoning since the author never bothers to ask who reads let alone who is persuaded by the discursive constructs that she so rapidly catalogues one wonders why she has devoted all this energy to debunking notions that are probably believed by virtually no one 
didn t work for me this book is a quick read though obviously there is more there how much exactly remains in question apparently others have seen more there than i did but i think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it if one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality one will find it extracting meaning from each picture each word each pause but i don t know i found the alchemist to be much more successful in doing a similar thing i would recommend that one instead 
not worth the time the writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense i thought something might change that it might become an interesting ghost story or there might be moral issues or maybe even a character would grow or change the heavy handed ending is perhaps intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones but that s a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness are we supposed to take everything that ellie says about the amish in court peaceful gentle incapable of murder loving child centric willing to accept an out ofwedlock child into the community as lies the ending belongs to a much darker book my biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing i kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story 
outdated ancient history exiled cubans in miami up to this is real old stuff i wonder why this book is still being published felt like a collection of shorter magazine newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book many long disjointed sentences could use an updating there must be better books out there about this topic 
souls of black folk was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free 
miller s nyt reporting needs to be remembered anyone who s read this book or is considering doing so should consider what has come to light about judith miller s reporting in the build up to the iraq war simply do a search on google for judith miller see in particular the articles in slate miller was regularly writing front page columns for the new york times which contained sensational claims now known to be wildly inaccurate about iraq s possession or efforts to obtain wmds one telling detail to the quality of miller s reporting can be gleaned from her concession in may of that the now discredited ahmed chalabi provided most of the scoops aka lies for her front page stories on wmds based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre war reporting i think readers of miller s work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims 
who is really writing these i ll be honest the last three novels have me thinking that patricia cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name the voice the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels and its very frustrating leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she d been attacked by the pod people or something i hold firm to the idea that she hasn t been writing these novels there is just no way 
not as good as the other reviewers think the spirit of laws is a passionate and eloquent statement of liberalism but it is only that a statement it is not a defence montesquieu rails against despotism and carefully spells out the separation of government powers but unlike locke or mill he gives little argument for why liberalism should be accepted and those few sketchy comments he does give eg despotism is bad even for the despot are unconvincing 
good book for a phd student this book is not for newcomers to statistics it often assumes a well versed backround in probability and statistics and i suppose a decent background in calculus there is often little explanation for examples and theorems often the exercises and examples require the solution to previous exercises this is extremely frustrating and often discouraging many times i would find myself being refered to an example in a previous or future chapter whose solution refers to a problem that needs to worked out i have an undergraduate degree in math and am by no means a genius but compared to many well written math texts the clarity and conciseness leaves much to be desired the exercises do not go from easier to more difficult but from difficult to difficult often the concept that is trying to be illustrated could be done in a much simpler problem that all said the book is fairly well written given the aforementioned weaknesses my professors seem to like it as do a couple of phd students 
nasty spring a friend of mine gave me this book to read and i was shocked by the poems the words that can best describe them are disturbing and pornographic i was embarrassed to read them and believe me i don t embarrass easily the poem the first is so sexually graphic that it belongs in an adult only book store and should be so labeled i like poetry that is uplifting about traditional themes such as love not just sex the beauty of the natural world etc i gave this book back to my friend and i cannot recommend it to anyone sincerelyalex charles 
a major dissapointment i bought this book nearly as soon as it came out and i absolutely loved it the cartoons and the layout of the book are superb i did not really use the cd s however because i was in transition between computers it was still nice knowing that there were more cartoons waiting for me if ever i wanted to read them and with the stellar quality of the book i assumed the same for the cd si was wrong the cartoons on the cd s are very low resoluton this means that the pictures are not clear they look a little blocky and pixelated also the large multi panel cartoons have been compressed even more so as to fit on to one page i was severely disappointed the captions however are very nice too bad it s often difficult to see what they re referring to i don t really have the complete cartoons of the new yorker i ve got about half with the other half illegibly thrown into the mix why then two stars it s simple the book itself is very nice with the price lower now it is a very reasonable price for the best cartoons of the new yorker which is what this book is without the cd s the book is wonderful just don t be confused into thinking that you will be able to read every cartoon as the book claims 
why continue to be deceived tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the pre trib circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler etc continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen s the real rapture based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period series see prophecy house s web site prophecyhouse dot com for details on these items 
waste of time waste of paper waste of money this book does have one merit the thermodynamic tables in the back are extensive and easy to read there is a wealth of information there that makes this a worthwhile reference book however this book is first and foremost a textbook and as a learning instrument it is an utter failure the book is littered with errors some are trivial such as misspelled words or incorrect references however many are serious errors such as incorrect formulas or errors in the answer key and can leave you dumbfounded as you try to figure out how a seemingly impossible miracle of mathematics can take place i remember one incident where i spent almost two hours working on one problem trying everything i could think of to get my answer to line up with the answer in the back of the book i eventually gave up and asked my professor the next day he worked it out and it turned out that my original answer was correct and the book was wrong ! this was an all toofrequent experience for me as i used this book and if i had a nickel for every minute i wasted finding errors in this book i would have an easy time paying for my other textbooks second the book is incredibly confusing i had over a gpa going into thermo i and was in my university s honors program i don t typically have problems with comprehending textbooks even poorly written ones however this book is totally incomprehensible to a student who has never taken a course in thermodynamics the logic meanders to and fro apparently lacking any direction the main points of each chapter are often hidden and poorly outlined the explanations sometimes get sidetracked by pointless trains of thought making it rather hard to pay attention it might as well be in greek third the book makes almost no connection between theory and practice if you are a visual learner you are completely out of luck i can t remember one single picture in the book most textbooks utilize pictures just for the sake of having pictures or to give the author an excuse to write a new revision this book is in dire need of a few well chosen pictures but all you will get are a plethora of vague and boring diagrams an appropriate picture can help a student make the transition from theory in this case the text and discussion of the book to practice the problems i found that i could with great difficulty translate the unintelligible babble of the text into an understanding of the fundamental concepts but when i needed to use this understanding to solve a complicated problem the connection between theory and practice wasn t there the sad thing is that if your professor uses this book and assigns problems from it you ll probably have to buy it anyway it s a total waste and i hope your professor is a good one because you won t be learning anything in these pages 
too fast ! non stop reading of scripts the content is full of valuable information on selling but this audio cd is not my favourite ziglar speaks so rapidly and non stop i guess nobody speaks in this mannner i mean if you want listeners to enjoy your speech it is better to speak in a more natural pace occassionally there should be a pause ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this cd choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever ! slow down slow down ziglar ! give me some space to absorb your message i wish i can listen to your cd comfortably but i can t you read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works ziglar i am sorry i have to give you stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this cd 
a disappointment it is distressing to see how many people are fooled into believing that one can awaken consciousness in a healthy way through lust and desire this method clearly contradicts the teachings of buddha krishna jesus tsong khapa the current dalai lama etc i encourage anyone who is seeking positive spiritual enlightenment to look at the teachings of these masters along with others who proved the virtuous sincerity of their hearts eliphas levi swami sivananda dion fortune rudolf steiner h p blavatsky and samael aun weor do not be misled by the tempting serpent to awaken positively you must conquer him 
if you like books about unicorns read this i ll put my opinion first so there won t be any doubt in your mind i don t believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as quotnational character quot people are just too different too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you how well can you predict what people in your own country will do would every italian if they could write well have written the same book as mr barzini i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man s views on the conglomerate nature of million italians after reading it i felt even more strongly that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist anthropologists have been concerned for many years in getting the quotinside view quotthe view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history socio economic patterns religion family etc but the specific results are just that specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last the tragedy of italy s long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian quotcharacterquot is fuzzy contradictory and ultimately unconvincing finally if you are a lover of lists you will thrill to this book because there is a list on nearly every single page myself i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy read another book if you just want entertainment which might support any stereotypes you have about italians then this book could be for you 
unfortunate display of robbins abilities i unfortunately could not get through this book t r just went on and on getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills i wish i could write a better review but i can t get past the second chapter perhaps further on down the road i will give it another try in the meantime i recommend all tom s other novels 
a disappointment i have read several of mr dickey s books and really enjoy them however this one sas a disappiontment a friend whom read this book said it was a great read but i would have to disagree i was expecting it to end differemtly than it did because i already had a idea about how it would end before it did i really found the ending boring but i still intend on reading mr dickey s other books 
cosmo style of writing very basic info this was a painful read the writer writes as though she s writing for cosmo magazine almost patronizing style of writing in a joking manner at least i find very annoying very basic signals anyone should already know no secret to me at least i don t understand anyone being happy with buying and reading this book have to wonder who it is really writing all these positive reviews i found other books such as the lay guide stumbling naked in the dark and the system so much better i can t even compare them against this book that is headed for the trash since it s too late to return would give it of a star if i could 
a self contradicting and and completely inaccurate book this book is filled with incorrect misleading information on ways to manipulate the human voice to achieve sounds ie belting that are scientifically proven to be damaging many of the techniques described in this book require the physical manipulation of the vocal apparatus a process which can lead to undue strain on the vocal folds and surrounding musculature though this books does occassionally contain accurate information on the process of healthy singing there is far too much that is incorrect and poses permanent damage to the voice the author frequently contradicts herself as she explains her process of vocal quottrainingquot the techniques of this book ask the reader to embark on an unhealthy and permanently damaging course of vocal study i recommend this book only to those wishing to know how not to sing 
this book tries too hard i was really looking forward to settling in with this book and having a good laugh instead what i found was a pretentious book where the author tried way too hard to be funny and very little of it actually was the author definitely has a way of turning a phrase in an original way but you cannot hang an entire chapter on one cute phrase reading this book was just way too much effort and not nearly fun enough yuck 
not my cup my stars are generous i liked this memoir the first time i read it but upon reading it a second time i could only wonder what i was thinking the first time around as fellow reader bruce suggests tea s story does have merit and i would add social importance but the ways in which she conveys her story or fails to convey it sometimes leaves much to be desired i feel like the real story is still in the walls of tea s mind in the walls of the house where she grew up in the walls of words that she has contructed and called the chelsea whistle but hey it s her memoir not mine in short tea s memoir could be about pages shorter ! it had really good potential but it does not leave a lasting impression i would have liked to see tea draw out more of the social issues and implications relating to class religion sexuality etc surrounding her coming of age instead at some of the most crucial moments we get walls pointless references to what she ate on random days or how she tried to cure a yeast infection and trust me unlike other writers there was no symbolic value in any of these references nonetheless i credit tea for being so open and candid with her story i just expected and hoped for something different something resonant and socially useful especially since she calls herself a feminist something more 
who wrote this surely not hillerman if tony hillerman wrote this novel novella actually i sure can t tell i have been a chee leaphorn fan for many years but this novel is not in the same league with hillerman s other work it is reminiscent of a b movie instead of building suspense the plot is laid out all too plainly the characters are unreal and the chee bernie romance doesn t ring true i am amazed that it was published 
propaganda and a lousy thesis if my eleventh grade son had written this book i would have given it a d when rashid khalidi write it it gets a triple f the logic is not there the facts are wrong cant palestinians do more than hate israelis 
simply awful let me start by saying that many will think this review is not helpful and i don t care have i read this book no did i spend the worst year of my life with deborah hughes hallets last calc book yes do i feel the responsibility to tell people that that book sucked more than anything yes do i think this book could be much different nope check her last book and seeing the reviews it is a based on reviews and counting the only reason it has a star rating and that is because some people give it stars most reviews are savoid this author at all costs 
this hurts me more than it hurts you it breaks my heart to write a negative review of a curious george book i love curious george as much as anyone even the original books don t quite stand the test of time after all the man with the yellow hat basically kidnaps a young ape away from his mother an ape who is obviously quite an intelligent animal and capable of very complex emotions by the way i know this is a weird beef but please help me spread the word curious george is a chimpanzee thus an ape and not a monkey he is just as distantly related to monkeys cousins about million years removed as you are anyway the old books still capture the imagination but what could they possibly be thinking with this new series i know it s a book for kids but honestly if a fifth grader wrote this book i would be embarrassed for them if the author is over the age of ten and spent anymore than an hour working on this book then shame on them my three year old put on a brave face but i think even she was dismayed at the striking lack of nuance go buy the old ones like when curious george swallows the puzzle piece and has to go to boston s children s hospital to get endoscoped 
another mlb authorized rip off another book of pretty pictures from mlb complete with a sanitized text that mistakes acheivements for moments and re writes history to sell more t shirts and other authorized garbage the recent spate of mlb books have been particularly embarrassing and this is no better if you buy this book you are encouraging mlb to produce more books that seek to re write the facts of history into a marketble form and that don t respect the intelligence of the audience buy a real book written by real writers about a real topic rather than something sponsored by a credit card company 
more of the same i have read all of bryson s books and loved them intuition said to not but this book since reliving childhood has been done time and time again in my opinion the title of this book is the only creative part of the book sure bryson can be funny but this book reeks of being forced really not worthly of what the author has done in the past we have heard all of this before save your money or go to the library 
extremely disappointed i am sorry i bought this book perhaps the author has an artistic vision which works for her but these photos of her quilts look very amateurish the directions are poor she states she started this method because she had trouble getting her blocks seams to match her solution is to take a row of blocks add random strips of fabric then square it up after it is finished one does not need to spend money on a book to learn how to do this please find a book that has good patterns or can teach you something about quilting 
rose red i have admittedly not read the book but the tv movie was a steal on the haunting of hill house 
examining a boring life through a high powered microscope first let me state that i have been impressed by all the canin i have read prior to starting quotblue river quot the problem with this novel isn t that it follows pattern similar to canin s other works most notably quotfor kings and planets quot a far more mature novel but that the protagonist is very hard to empathize with a successful california optimologist the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism when he s not bothering with that he s repeatly over describing his less successful brother after the first few times i understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school there s a good story here but it s trapped under a poor plodding narrative 
no real strategies for making money in all markets this book is full of historical facts graphs and charts but when it comes time for the author to expose her secrets of how to make money in all these markets her book is a bust three paragraphs of common sense statements like buy low sell high duh not worth your time or money ! 
not her best effort i m a tami hoag fan but this book was weak at best the plot was predictable the characters stereotypical and dimensional the reparte between the characters was overly witty and contrived hoag is definitely capable of a more intricate plot and better writing 
no zero stars option does anyone even care that the author john miller formerly of abc s and then the head of counterterrorism for the lapd is currently the assistant director of public affairs for the fbi in the bush regime i mean administrationthis book is propaganda period 
are cliff roberts and david owen related this is a wonderfully researched book and well written as you d expect from mr owen and i enjoyed reading it but wondered if i was the only one who thought it was ruined by the obsessive desire to defend cliff roberts even on matters that really seem pointless so i came here to read reviews and i couldn t help but notice that many of the glowing reviews here on amazon appeared to be written by the same person but i was glad to see some agreed with me about the format of the book i suppose it s a must for the pictures if you want to see the course the way it once was but i recommend avoiding it if you get irritated with a book that has an agenda and seems to go out of its way to not just tell the story but to address issues that someone wanted addressed 
didn t live up to my expectations as it says in the title this book is a lipogram and dictionary com gives us this definition a writing composed of words not having a certain letter or letters it is a very neat idea and the book creates a clever way of making the structure part of the story itself however it reminds me of communism in that in theory it sounds incredibly good but in actuality it is a failure everything about the story from plot to characters is boring and dimensional there s no development beyond the basic lipogrammatic theme and that gets old after a while espeically since after more and more letters go away the book just gets written with alternate spellings using the remaining allowable letters and even at pages it went on too long it was too repetitive i appreciated the author s love for language but at times that even got annoying because it felt forced although i was happy to find a book with interesting new vocabulary in it ! in short i give credit for the idea but i would not really reccomend you read this book 
ask a silly question richard rothstein is no more qualified to advise on education than the new governor of california who is a body builder the objective of education is economic self sufficiency getting ahead in life requires connections not knowledge american blacks are denied connections we all know why and how the black white gap which rothstein writes about is not information but access valuable knowledge is learned on the job not in school teachers do not control access employers do blacks who are told otherwise are being cheated centuries ago schools were for the elite whose privileged positiion in life was predestined this was not changed by free public schools america s political leaders never learned this fundamental lesson us grant who in fact liberated blacks imagined blacks would quickly join mainstream america kkk put an end to that dream just saying again and again that there is a gap does not acknowledge the reality ask a bona fide teacher when black youth knows schooling will be rewarded education will command respect wallace f smith walnut creek c 
went in with high hopes and was left putting the book down every two seconds because i was annoyed by it it is not marvelously written in fact i found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph if not more editor please it s an interesting enough plot but the way it s put forth is mindnumbing the non fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways first if the information had been summarized in about two pages and second if he hadn t pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities im usually a fast reader but this book a quick page paperback read took me more than a month just because i had to keep putting it down if you simply want something to frighten you or are unusually interested with autopsies there are about five million in the book and don t care about poor writing pick this book up 
no stars lack of talent leads to jealousy that inspired the author to create his theories 
boring this book was extremely short relying on large type and large margins to fill the book it was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste it was typical of oprah book club books in that it is very depressing i think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully you did get a sense of the main character but with such a short book the rest were very weak 
should be subtitled in defense of hrt i was looking for a bit of reasurrance and guidance for alternative treatments i certainly didn t get it here ! ms sheehy has few suggestions for perimenopausal women other than hrt which she describes as almost magical since i have a family history of breast cancer and consequently no desire to try hrt i needed books with a more positive tone and other treatment options i would strongly recommend dr susan love s hormone book and the pause by lonnie barbauch instead 
writer s political view is in the book i am extremely disappointed in the inside ring by mike lawson injecting his personal political views into the book as a way of adding current events into a fiction book has made this unreadable i did not select his book to read his political views here are some references that i believe are linked to current administration page reference to dixie chickspage reference to the invisible weapons of mass destruction 
sent wrong book they did not specify that it was the study guide instead of the actual book i needed 
civil war history lite skip it treats some of the stories of the civil war in the west without explaining the larger issues this is an inexpensive book but not necessarily a good value 
the definition of trash trash sells and this is the definition of trash unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
just ok i started reading the no ladies detective agency but could never really get into it i liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go sadly although the book has some funny moments berties tantrums ! it never really gripped me i love scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the insider comments the book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking hold on what happened to and what was the point of on the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did 
one step above or below pulp fiction most of these stories were writen for the saturday evening post and later compiled in book form the copy i have is a olders paperback not the current pricey literary collection captain david grief called the son of the sun for his body s ability to tan perfectly is a trader entrepreneur and adventurere in the south seas in each of the eight episodes which comprise the book he has a less than spectacular adventure which he solves using the combination of brawn and brain there s not enough excitement to be true pulp fiction and the stories are too slow in developing to interest youthful readers so it begs the question who comprises the intended readership i read them because they were writen by london and as such are well crafted even if boring unlike many of his other works i won t be reading this one again 
disappointed this book was as much the author s opinion and imagination as anything else he makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts biblical or otherwise i will not purchase further books by this author 
amazingly naive vibration this is a truly amazing book ! this is a book written by a highly uneducated person for even less educated reader as the author says in the introduction this book is designed for young people of all ages well what s that young of all ages simple those whose imagination has not been stifled by standard educational process at the very outset the author reassures the reader that the book is not going to be a technical or scientific one he says with a poorly concealed pride my brush with academia was a fairly short one i was expelled from kindergarten at the age of four and have never managed to resume normal studies since not to mention graduating from anyplace as a result i am a fairly stupid fellow who could not learn any mathematics at all this lack of really serious knowledge of anything does not prevent the author from making judgments always with a sort of elegance of ignorance regarding very big topics like say theory of relativity and holography and brain functioning through electromagnetic and sound vibrations and biggg banggg of course so my recommendation to those with at least k education do not waste time and find a better way to spend the most surprising aspect of this book is that dr william tiller a respected scientist and writer found it possible to write a preface for this book this preface is the best part of the book 
despite my fear of being accused of not being hip i must venture out and say oh my god what who cares franny is pregnant the big twist in this story was that it was in the s but beyond that what s the point take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent overanalytical pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood boring in the s and boring now as a fan of catcher if the rye i couldn t wait to get my hands on franny and zooey holden was familiar franny and zooey made me want to shower i really wish i had the time back that i spent reading this trite piece of 
hack writing makes best seller i read this book because it says it was a best seller and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense with those expectations i was disappointed the author relies on gimmicks like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you re reading faster each chapter is or pages with at least one blank page between so what looks like a page books is really only a page short novel one chapter is literally a cliff hangerthe plot s sort of a rehash of h g wells island of dr moreau borrowing a bit from x men comic books the mutants are all children who can fly and they re severely persecuted by their keepers so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle another cheap gimmick the villains are all one dimensional stereotypes blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children i could point out numerous flaws in style as well but that s not the point you could find flaws in better books too the point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines i ve read even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels my arms were high and tight around his neck he pulled me against him and i felt him all of him against my thigh the author also doesn t seem to understand the geography terrain of the area he s writing about for example a small sony tv won t receive denver channels in gunnison national forrest certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes and has some weird ideas of horror chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough but to see the words us government attached to trespassers will be shot made me ill much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy the arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything i believed in i wanted to find one of them and strangle the person with my bare hands this is the last time i ll buy a book because it says best seller if you want to read a well written sci fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy i recommend the fourth r by george o smith isbn also known as the brain machine isbn 
the information is a bit out of date since this book was kind of recommanded with cakewalk s home studio so i took it then learned that the home studio mentioned in this book isn t the same home studio product currently made by cakewalk some information still applies but it ll take some mental exercise to filter out those no longer applies if you are looking for current information on cakewalk s product home studio then you need to look elsewhere 
book in need of an editor i ordered this book because i am extremely interested in theuntold stories of the partition of india even though thereviews told me not to i wished i had heeded the advice the book is incredibly repetitive to the point of being unreadable i learned very little not worth the time to read or money to purchase 
good grief this was bad i am an avid reader pretty intelligent and read at least books a week more when on vacation i have read books about all kinds of people in all cultures and this book turned into a quest a quest to finish it i never stop reading a book once i start it but i was about ready to shoot myself in order to end my distress if you want to read a really really good book about desperation in the indian culture you simply must must must read a fine balance one of the best books i have ever read it s always on my suggested reading list when people ask me for the name of a good book along with life of pi i simply don t understand all the wonderful remarks about this book it went on and on and on and on with the same thing happening to this man over and over with only a change in his location it would pick up every now and again and i would think now it s going to start to get interesting but i was only entertained for a page or two before mr biswas returned to his same ol depressing self repeating the same mistakes over and over and over and over and over and over well you get the point boring boring book i would have given it stars but that wasn t an option 
uneven narrative couldn t get into it i thought i was getting a treat with mortal love after all this interwoven story that starts during victorian england and ends in modern times seemed interesting and just my cup of tea at first however i was deeply disappointed with such an over the top uneven and pretentious offering the story begins with the backdrop of pre raphaelite art and how the visit of a man to one of the models evienne upstone drives his grandson insane years later and then daniel rowlands an american writer travels to london to research the legend of tristan and iseult in that journey he meets larkin meade a strange and mystifying fey whose dark strange powers bring daniel to the brink of insanity it is only when he does further research that he realizes his life is connected to larkin in more ways than one there are various twists throughout the novel there is no easy way to write a plausible synopsis for this novel because the story is so disjointed at times that i was confused all the while i read this thing i ll start with the good points i liked the historical references and the gothic feel of the novel the fantasy aspect is rather interesting as well the characters aren t very likeable though flawed to the max but that is not what frustrated me about this novel after all i have read my fair share of books in which the characters aren t meant to be sympathetic or relatable in any way what frustrated me was the writing as said earlier i was confused the whole time and had to go back to previous pages to remember who was whom and what was what the style of writing is too prosaic as well descriptive to the point of being redundant as for the erotic aspect of the book as an avid erotica reader i must say that the sex scenes are well done but said elements don t make this an enjoyable read i had to force myself to finish this and any book that is a chore for me does not deserve more than two stars all in all mortal love had an interesting premise but the author failed to deliver it 
too simple bad photos not hawking i m not a cosmologist but stephen hawking s universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending the language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper moreover the pictures are second rate pre contact lense hubble knock offs despite being published in and the book has very little to do with stephen hawking sure he wrote the foreward and did some editing but it lacks the wit and wonder of a hawking work naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading i am a chemist and despite this filkin s descriptions of chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb down ideas that aren t dumb downable and didn t include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration if you want to learn some cosmology read quota brief history of time quot or quota short history of the universe quot these are simply written but informative works that won t leave you waiting for substance 
disappointment i m not sure who s writing these reviews but i read repitition after repitition after repitition with a lot of confusing fluff asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues what s fierce about that the writing style and content just didn t flow wasn t real i mean in one section she actually uses the term bucko as in let me tell you something bucko what are we in happy days couldn t take the book seriously after that very bad 
an unwieldy translation in a nutshell don t waste your money on this version the original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century but the introduction and further editing by anatol rapaport a biologist and a musician not a political scientist or historian make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst rapaport for being an editor of clausewitz was not a believer in the trinitarian system primordial violence non rational actions and rationality probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second trinities army people and government if this is the only one you can get then live with it the first chance you get get the much clearer much more straightforward paret howard translation which is the one that s actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it 
wasted my money the title was the best part of this book not worth purchasing if you must read it check it out from the library or borrow it don t ask me for it mine is headed for goodwill because i can not stand to burn or trash a book it was awful and vulgar very disappointed i hope someone else writes the book to fit the title unfortunately i bought two books by the author and was disappointed with both 
a worthless book home made and thoughtless interesting only for its defense of the slaughter in tiananmen square 
horrid this book is the biggest pile of excrement ever written it is also full of cryptic run on sentences that waste paper and ink this book should not be allowed 
implausible thriller with a twist that just doesn t work having a novel s narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre when this plot device is done well the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist not left wondering what the hell happened when the twist works best the author hasn t actually lied to the reader but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions when the twist comes the reader experiences a light bulb moment realizing they were duped but that they should have seen it coming in beach road the ending doesn t make much sense and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed beach road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying my question to mr patterson is if one of the characters lies to the reader for the first of the novel why do they start telling the truth near the end why not lie all the way through or tell the truth right from the beginning i think it would have been much more interesting if the character s lies were exposed not by their own confession but through the observations of other characters of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel my other major gripe is that so much of it doesn t make sense for example the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows somehow loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing this is ridiculous drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find how else do people buy drugs from them it s ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing even with silly nicknames second case in point the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen they don t notice the absence of blood and don t check to make sure the shot was fatal it doesn t make sense patterson churns out novels faster than nora roberts these days and apparently isn t worried about quality beach road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a patterson novel to avoid 
not one of patterson s better novels this novel highly disappointed me and i m a big james patterson fan the usual short chapters don t bother me but this novel was running over with characters okayso i don t like too many characters that i have to remember but i stayed with the book and when it came to the ending i kept telling myself no way but it ended the way it ended i purchased this one but i think maybe i ll get the next patterson release from the library i think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
watch your mouth the author of this book tries too hard to be clever here if you want a better book that s smart and provocative go read lolita 
terrible it s boring slow and dull and stupid turn of the century is so boring and slow moving that it s not worth reading in the first half of the book literally close to nothing happens added to which anderson makes the book so convoluted it s like a badly executed altman ensemble drama it s impossible to keep track of all of these characters and formulate a good idea of what they re actually like added to which the highly trumpeted tom wolfe style satire in the book is so blunt and obvious that one wonders how many made the connection between anderson and the esteemed writer of bonfire of the vanities bottom line boring dull and pretty stupid really 
not the best for confronting cultists if you are looking for short and snappy answers to defeat the cultist on your doorstep this is not the book you want while each saying is considered in a brief page or two the style of this book is to discuss and analyze the text very closely but so closely that the discussion bogs down into such things as transitive vs intransitive verbs etc yes it explains the subtlety of the text but in such detail that the answer can only be appreciated by a believer unfortunately i find that it does not answer my questions about the hard sayings of jesus very well either nothing in this book equps me to answer the hard questions of the cultist who stands on the street corner passing out tracts or comes to my door offering the truth on such occasions which often degenerate into a theological streetfight i need to use the word as a sword therefore i want a big sword not a magnifying glass as a christian i appreciate this book as it requires me to ponder the depth and richness of god s word but this is not the book to present to a skeptic who needs simpler more direct less obtuse answers to his or her questions 
a good compilation of early th century physics this is a good book but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory for instance e mc was not created by einstein as so many people people an italian physicist came up with it if you don t believe me check any encyclopedia einstein suceeded in taking everyone s work and compiling it this was helpful to the world of physics unfortunately this stuff is outdated and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book when it came out it was already outdated this was published in the s autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the s i believe if this was published in the s or even the s it would have been a good book 
stop killing trees i am always interested in the intellectual history of science particularly the faustian dilemma often we want to sell our souls to the devil for an article or a grant for scientists in nazi germany the faustian dilemma was to sacrifice their jewish friends and colleagues on the altar of nazism hundreds of careers were made this way overall i was very disappointed with this book first to fill the first hundred pages cornwell spends way too much time discussing wwi without any real connection to the ideological development on nazi science and the danger of scientists who embraced nazism fully second cornwell deals rather efficiently without finesse or surprises for that matter with the usual array of popularized accomplishments of nazi science during the war the book reads as a companion guide to a documentary on the history channel stories of v and v zyklon b radio navigation and the a bomb have been told better before third the book avoids the big moral and scientific dilemma in nazi science lebensraum when the third reich occupied poland it relied heavily on economic analysis on the economic viability of the occupation economists and sociologists walked hand in hand to analyze the most efficient way to occupy that country and to extract its human capital industrial and agricultural resources cornwell mentions the economic analysis of the viability of concentration camps but that is only a small proportion on how social sciences supported the nazi ideology fourth it was hardly surprised then that genetic experiments in the concentration camps are glossed over in the book benno muller hill is reduced to being a reference fifth the most glaring omission is the role of social sciences which i tangentially mentioned earlier during the s an entire generation of new academic social scientists were manufactured to benefit polish improve and offer scientific backing to the emerging nazi ideology in less than years history sociology economics linguistics geography and political science were rewritten and reanalyzed by this committed cadre of bright young nazis following the end of the war these still young academics were not removed although many of them wholeheartedly embraced nazism they were able to keep their academic appointments except for a few of the older guard they sold their soul as much as the younger group few of them were removed and some became marginalized not because they were nazis those who kept their academic positions served as teachers professors and advisors to a new class of students few of these academics retired before the s and they dominated the german intellectual contribution in social sciences for over years from nazism to social democracy 
title should be ross jackson rambles i was so disappointed in this book that i put it aside for several years finally this weekend i picked it back up and read it cover to cover just out of curiousity it s kind of interesting but it s not what it proclaims itself to be i originally found it by doing a search for cohousing and or ecovillages seeing the title and we are doing it ! building an ecovillage future and seeing that it even had a hammer and nails on the cover i wrongly assumed that it would be about the actual building of an ecovillage i was curious to see another insight into structures chosen and rejected and what form of internal governance they chose and why well this book has almost none of that rather this slim booklet is jt ross jackson s rambling musings about how gaiacorp and gaia trust came to be just as he gets to the topic of co housing he makes a radical departure and devotes all of chapter to his mystical and paranormal experiences with a spiritual awakening during a brief trip to india at that point i really felt like he d lost a lot of credility to a wider audience he goes on to do a good job detailing some of the problems he and his wife encountered setting up some green financial institutions and he does a good job describing some of the problems with the wto and mai and out of control trans national corporations he paints a picture of a world about to crash ecconomically socially and environmentally through greed it s a good message but the folks that need to hear it aren t going to wade through the rest of the book to get to that part then he ends the booklet with a few pages of badly written sci fi while i happen to like futuristic sci fi i found it sad that the only part of the book that touched on a vision of an ecovillage and the inherent internal policy issues had to be one set in with some very unlikely touches i really can t recommend this book if you already tend towards green and you want a fun read this might be worth checking out but if you want info on actually establishing an ecovillage this book is going to disappoint you 
didn t find anything that was useful or particularly interesting i had high hopes for this book what with dr allen s apparent endorsement and jay cross writing a positive review of it i found the book dry and boring i started each chapter with the hope that it would reveal something useful that could be readily applied but each chapter ended flat i found a great deal of wisdom in dr allen s books i was hoping that this book might give me somewhat of a different perspective that would expand upon and even disagree with the instructional design perspective in dr allen s books instead it caused me to want to go back and re read dr allen s books to see if my present experience level would cause me to find new meaning micheal allen s guide to e learning and creating successful e learningi give this book stars because clark quinn does include some examples i think that this book would have been far more worthwhile if it was written around these examples i would have liked to see him explain an idea and then really delve into how he applied that idea in the examples he shows in the book instead the examples seem somewhat removed from what the author is primarily saying in each chapter 
too much detail the book contained too much detail on manufacturing i would have preferred the book to cover less ground the review entitled quotwords words words quot encompasses my view exactly unfortunately i did not read all the reviews first i will not make that mistake again 
snotty and obnoxious bryson is certainly witty but any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author s snotty and obnoxious tone i can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self image what a whining immature mean jerk and by the way there s a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book 
not sure what the fuss is about i just didn t enjoy this book i don t mind so much that a book isn t plot driven if the language is beautiful and the ideas stimulating with this book however i didn t even find the language poetic or evocative and the ideas were so repetitive and expressed so turgidly that i stopped reading half way through i really thought this book could do with a whole lot of editing it was unsubtle self indulgent and dull perhaps something got lost in the translation so disappointed i had been eager to read this book for ages and when it was finally available at the library i was very excited oh well 
mind numbing garbage i ve read all sorts of books throughout my educational career from james joyce to dry sociological texts i ve read books so dull i could feel them sapping my life energy never before though have i had to suffer through a book as mind numbingly awful as member of the wedding mere words cannot communicate how bad this book really is it follows the pathetic worthless existence of frankie the most unlikeable irritating sorry excuse for a human being ever to disgrace a piece of literature this book reads like a bad linkin park video and consists largely of frankie whining about wanting to belong and wanting to travel with her older brother who is about to get married the only thing i can say for this book is that it is relatively well writtenobviously carson mccullers was a good writer but thomas harris wrote silence of the lambs and the he wrote hannibal hannibal is a god awful book and it still doesn t approach the level of putridity reached by this claptrap of course many reviewers would have you believe that this book is about the awkwardness isolationloneliness of acolescence bull i was an awkward isolatedlonely teen and i did strange things but frankie s actions are downright bizarre inexplicable and only serve to make you loathe her further for absolutely no reason the author kills off a couple characters at the end just to make sure that if you weren t suicidally depressed by the book by that point you sure wouldn t have a reason to live after finishing the whole book like i said think bad linkin park song garish whiney needlessly depressing and completely pointless there is no message here except that there is no hope no moral except that life is empty pointless isolated and lonely i m a big fan of literature musicart that emphasizes such themes as isoltation and abandonment and thus i tend to enjoy such works even if they re pretty lousy this however was the bottom of the barrel in cheap exploitative pathetic useless literature if you want to read something that deals with isolation abandonmentloneliness read eugene o neills the iceman cometh long day s journey into night or the hairy ape i promise you will find all much more well written and moving than this garbage in conclusion when i finished reading this vile book i hated the main character i hated the human race i hated the author responsible for my suffering but most of all i hated myself for subjecting myself to this bloated corpse of a novel read it on the toilet or better yet read something good and save this to use as toilet paper consider it an appropriate afterthought 
some weird choices it s always easy to criticize somebody s personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable actresses and not stars of the studio era so it comes pretty natural to ask is esther williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook margaret sullavan was grace kelly s talent so overwhelming to forget that miriam hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as lubitsch wyler mamoulian hawks and vidor to stunning results what was wrong with mary astor s acting and what is right with kim novak s actress to me means patricia neal or shelley winters norma shearer or natalie wood were stars think about it 
fluff this book is garbage filler to make money a travesty all the others were awesome to ok but let s face it get on with it ! i m not really interested in pages of matt traveling with the circus or elayne s torment becoming queen or egwene s mishaps with other aes sedai i want some action what s going on in the ashaman sp s heads i mean how cool would that be since the taint is gone i m sick of this but i ll still read the rest who knows how much time i ve already spent surely it must be over soon not even tolkien could go on this long wrap it up 
longitude this is without a doubt one of the most boring books i have ever read you need to take notes to understand it it is very disjointed it feels like a bunch of different chapter articles bound together in book form it deals with a fascinating subject it is a pity that it was not better written because it could have been an excelent book this may be the fault of the editor rather than the writer she certainly needed some expert help with making her chapters fit together in a cohesive manner 
old woman rambling i think the annie dillard name is the sole reason for this book being published i write the word book in quotes because to call this a book is more than a bit of a stretch to me it reads like an old senile person rambling nearly incoherently about things her mind has lost the ability to grasp for longer than a sentence or two i can see only one very general theme come out of this that people are a product of the earth why does it take pages to relate that no longernew theme and relating the theme is all the book does no explanation no analysis of the theme nothing beyond merely stating it in a very long winded and oblique way i hate to be so critical of this work but i hope to save others the trouble of buying and reading this incoherent mess 
wolf in sheep skin if you are a christian this book isn t for you it is full of blashphemy concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution since when was god in need of forgiveness isnt it that god so loved the world and it wasnt us that loved god i have no words in describing this book it is full of error because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner and that it isnt your fault and that actully you are a good person why do bad things happen to good people wrong question there are no good people in the world in the first place for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god the world is in sin the world does not have good people only by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book it hasnt helped million people but it lied to them kusher please turn from your ways and come to jesus then will you understand the life question why 
narrative equivalent of home shopping network saul bellow won the nobel prize and after his recent death numerous respectful eulogies proclaimed that the big issues of soul and conscience were at the center of his fiction so who am i a nobody to say that the adventures of augie march is boring nonetheless i say that the experience of reading this classic of american fiction is akin to watching the home shopping network you know how those hsn salespeople show some object pore on the details and then move onto the next tacky item well that s how augie struck me you see what bellow does in this novel is to focus on the characters that augie meets as he matures moving from people who populate his boyhood to those who populate his adolescence and onward and as bellow introduces these characters he heaps he piles he shovels on the details once in a while one of his endless descriptions comes to life and the character makes sense but what i usually got from these descriptions is pointless and self indulgent craft the stuff is absolutely eye glazing in my case i put up the good fight and tried to push through these descriptions but my reward was gaaanother endless and tedious description usually of a character that didn t reappear yes some characters do reappear but you know what then you often don t remember anything about them they re strangers even though bellow has told you what kind of sandwich they like or how they pull on their pants the descriptions just don t resonate i bet that people who like this book start off with the premise that bellow is brilliant only a writer who considers himself or herself brilliant by the way would ever write such a book and if you think the guy is brilliant you look at his descriptions and see rich and complex nuggets of great descriptive writing it s brilliant ! but if you re a working stiff like me and want to end your day with a good story about a character moving through an emotional challenge augie is not for you instead it s a chance to go back to college where professors assign great books that totally turn off the average person to literature but say you re the sort of person who likes to end the day with a progression of baubles then turn on hsn instead on hsn at least they re trying to communicate this book is just a writer indulging himself a real show off augie might say 
only for suckers who would read all these reviews and then actually buy this book this book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population the suckers of which i am obviously one because i did read the stupid book ! it took me almost a year to get through it one half paragraph at a time before i would fall asleep each night if it wasn t for jordan i d have a hard time going to sleep at all it doesn t even deserve star 
late as i still have not received this book which is long overdue i can not review it ! 
what a mistake before i bought this book i read all the reviews some were bad some were good i decided to listen to the good ones what a mistake this has been how can anyone say this is a good book it s unreadable ! i loaned another book from the library and now i understand ada much better than before just by looking at the examples from the other book learn from my mistake don t buy this book 
well his heart was in the right place there are parts of this book which are utterly engrossing rosemont constructs a fine narrative of events perhaps i should say events as it is at times researched like a eighth grade paper lots of conjecture unsupported speculation hearsay and other aspects of irresponsible scholarship mr rosemont freely admits that there is frustratingly little concrete evidence about much of hill s life but he chooses to try and flesh out a lengthy book anyways this is exasperating at times as when one is forced to try and endure each and every tedious mentioning of the drawn or painted art of joe hill despite the lack of much actual material surviving anyways however by doing this he touches on many peripheral aspects of hill s life that have gone by and large unnoticed till now but which are much easier to verify than the sketchy details about hill himself several mentions of correspondence lives affected by hill and reactions to hill s art and many others tidbits of information are thrown out for more or less the first time in cohesive form less cohesive and downright teasing at times are many starts and stops of several ideas that would be very interesting on their own the wobbly influence on the beat poets the slighting of the iww by other revolutionary and pseudorevolutionary groups rarely written about from a fellow worker s perspective and others seem like promising beginnings for reading but then are waded into only ankle deep at one point when abandoning a topic mr rosemont even suggests that it would be a good idea for further research by someone else all in all a fairly decent read but could have used prodigious editing and some fact checking with standards higher than those of the ny times 
how not to write a romance this book should be an inspiration for romance writers indeed writers of any genre because after reading it you are sure you can write a better story now getting that story published may be a tad more difficult because you aren t already a best selling writer but hey we ve all got to start somewhere jayne ann krentz isn t the only writer whose early works fall in the category of head scratchers as in why in the world did anyone buy that manuscript other best selling authors have had less than stellar beginnings and when a begining writer reads these works it gives her courage to keep trying to write and sell her own stories if you don t fall in this category of reader then maybe you don t want to read this one 
another self indulgent heinlein novel heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention unfortunately these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein s final books we are also treated to some of heinlein s stock characters dirty old men horny female computers naked adolescent girls and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after would have a sparse population indeed as if this isn t enough heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing in spite of all their cameo appearances this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout heinlein s earlier novels written prior to are still fine fare for young people especially boys this novel as well as most of heinlein s later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption 
oh how this book doesn t work for its market if you can endure franken s cycle of hilarious writing to crap to writing about how crappy it is before finally getting back to the good stuff go for it oh the things i know takes great pains to steer clear of incindiary comments so that lots and lots of people who don t know a college graduate well enough to get them something they really want will buy this book as a graduation gift unfortunately for franken he s playing to the right audience the over buyer of the gift for a college graduate who will likely flip through a few pages and chuckle before setting it back down because the book isn t comforting uplifting or even really that funny for the market 
another bogus book from coren do dogs understand language do they have their own syntax and grammar stanley coren thinks so or maybe as with many of his other books he s only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people s interest and sell more copies the words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant since i train dogs in manhattan i often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs when the door closes i ll say what do we do on an elevator and they ll all sit this often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like look they understand every word you say ! not really i trained the dogs to do this by first saying what do we do on an elevator we sit once that pattern was established the dogs were able to make the leap from what do we do on an elevator to sit quite easily in fact i could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words gobbledygook ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all so it isn t my words or syntax the dogs are responding to it s my intent my body language my tone of voice all carrying emotional information and a previously established pattern of behavior stanley coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf yet still obeys him why because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior not because the dog understands his words coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing impaired understand sign language but looked at objectively it s far more likely that the dog s response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior not a linguistic or cognitive process coren would still disagree he claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together which he takes to mean that there s a kind of syntax or grammar at work i m sorry stan but real language doesn t operate on such a simplistic level and while it may seem brave and controversial of coren who has a degree in psychology not linguisics or animal behavior to disagree with noam chomsky about the nature of language at this stage in the development of linguistic science that s a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with sir isaac newton about gravity look it s fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips barks growls etc are sometimes used together and others aren t which isn t always true by the way it depends on the dog is that each vocalization comes from an emotional not a cognitive state in other words certain emotions like fear and aggression may be felt by the animal simultaneously while others calmness and fear can t be it s not grammar or syntax it s emotion pure and simple even if coren hadn t thought this through from an emotional point of view if he d spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he d know that a dog s brain has no broca s area which makes linguistic ability totally impossible but as with other books he s written his left hander syndrome was notorious for being based on false data coren doesn t seem to care much about the truth still i have to admit that it s hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we re constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues or to others through conversations letters etc as a result we re almost forced by the way our brains work to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog s feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists i trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever i ask him a certain question and i have to admit i like the way it feels when i say to him do you love me and he wags his tail comes over puts his paws on my chest and licks my nose does he understand the meaning of that sentence when i say it to him of course not but i know he understands the emotion its a shame that coren doesn t get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog a relationship that should be based on real and quite often wonderful emotions not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language if i could i d give this book no stars at all 
contains intriguing ideas concerning apocalyptic events this is a presentation of the possible events that will usher in the reign of the antichrist key event is a worldwide financial crisis and desperate people in need of a solution the solution will be offered by a group of conspirators or quotmoney masters quot countries will no longer have individual currencies but a one world currency will be initiated some of the theories presented involve timelines which have about expired there is repetition in thought and ideas and some of the ideas presented seem extreme still it is not possible to dismiss all of the book as lunacy and a few of the ideas stick in the mind and raise questions about what is happening in the world of today and in the united states 
great premise really bad author awful book gwtw certainly was one sided in its portrayal of the old south and i can see how that could be a deal killer for a lot of readers although i consider gwtw to be one of the greatest pieces of american literature ever written i was very excited by the idea of twdg the idea of building a back story around the black characters in mitchell s novel is brilliant ! so much could be done with this idea to address issues of race and slavery as well as to broadside a popular piece of american literature through counterpoint unfortunately this great idea is wasted because randall is utterly lacking in talent the thing that immediately bothered me about twdg is the extraordinarily poor use of dialect one sentence has the main character narrating in perfect grammar with strong vocabulary and then in the next sentence she s all he do dat and me go sleep randall should have picked one voice for her main character and stuck with it this alone represents terrible hack writing but i must go on and say something about the snicker plot the plot which should be subversive and controversial fails to rise above the trashy romance novel level and the i think they re supposed to be shocking sex scenes wouldn t shock anyone except my amish aunt minnie i actually laughed out loud several times as i read them because i pictured clark gable rhett butler saying some of this ridiculous dialogue the plot here is so flaccid that randall inadvertently undermines her own book the white characters remain more interesting than any of the black characters this despite the fact randall gives them tons of dirty linen to air in an obvious and pathetic attempt to make them interesting her black characters are non entities which i believe was her beef with mitchell in the first place right as a result by writing twdg randall is only spray painting a nasty word on the castle walls of gwtw when what she needed to do was bulldoze the original dance gleefully on its grave and create something very powerful in its place but that would take a skilled writer and randall just doesn t have the goods taking on gwtw is a great idea especially to stir up discussion around issues of racism and slavery in our country and our history however to do an idea like that justice requires a talented author ie not alice randall maybe toni morrison should take this on i d read that 
a hot book on tape in proves an embarassment for the authors in this book on tape was published early just in time for listeners to lose a ton in the stock bust almost every investor lost money on stocks then but a listener following the advice in this book on tape would have lost much more with some tech stocks never recovering because of bankruptcy some of the advice is quite good but about is downright wrong and dangerous if you know enough to know which advice is good and which is bad then you don t need this book perhaps something went wrong when abridging the longer written text to produce these audio tapes in any event if you still want to give it a shot or if you just love the motley fool then look for something by the gardner brothers that s newer and or not so abridged 
not a good book my daughter is into the civil war so i bought this book for her i read it first and am glad i did i cannot recommend it it is boring and has very little suspense i know the civil war was a sad and serious time but familied still had some happy times in the midst of it ! cass the main character s younger sister has visions and all sorts of weird things i do not want to expose my children to that another character also reads cards and supposedly has second sight these things are occultic to me therefore i cannot recommend this book at all 
in the tradition of kenneth anger probably no biography is without some value but this is one of the two worst chaplin books published the comedian was hardly a perfect man and there are things about him even a long time fan might find bothersome but much of this biography is trashy and filled with unsubstantiated ugly rumors david robinson s chaplin his life and art published twenty years ago remains the best way to learn about mr chaplin s complex life and work while glenn mitchell s chaplin encyclopedia i have found very helpful this book is best ignored and forgotten 
science lovers only ugh as a confessed bibliophile i honestly try to give every single book its due but this one was impossible poetic but impossible barrett attempts to weave these stories about antiquated botanists into one connective tissue but it is too far a stretch unless you eat breath and sleep xylem and phloem don t waste time trying to pad through this book 
vb vba developers beware if you are attracted to this title thinking that this will help you how make the jump from coding in vb vba for ms office apps to coding in vb net you are in for a rude surprise this book is for programmers wanting to leverage their knowledge of c to develop solutions for ms office the book is okay as far as it goes for c sharp i guess but the failure in the book title and description to make clear what net language is being discussed is misleading 
my eyes glazed over felt like i was in latin class read both books and all the reviews of books with basically the same name and if you want more information in a much more user friendly readable in english format at the price buy the other book by smith divorce and money everything you need to know i read a review that the smith book just wants you to hire expensive lawyers nothing could be further from the truth no matter what you need a lawyer and this book tells you the same thing it doesn t mean you have to be stupid ! as a normal middle class guy with a college education and my own business this book makes you feel like you are in latin class again do your self a favor and not only buy smith s book on money get her book on children you will save lots of time and stress 
just okay i would rate this book as okay it doesn t delve deep enough into the subject matter and he tells too many personal stories also he says that evil spirits aren t fallen angels but the souls of the damned or the unsaved dead i skipped most of that chapter overall i wouldn t recommend this book a few parts are good but most of it is boring 
about as deep as a magazine article i was very disappointed in this book i felt i could have written it myself using platitudes and the type of jargon one finds in a women s magazine article i would have preferred more concrete advice instead of touchy feely pseudo psychology i didn t learn a thing i didn t already know 
trashy life styles of the rich and famous this book relates incidents from the lives of famous women during the s edna st vincent millay dorothy parker edna ferber and zelda fitzgerald however that is strictly what it does relates incidents it does not attempt to share any insight make any connections between their behavior and their writings nor between the writers there is no theme quoteat drink and be merry quot without the conclusion quotfor tomorrow we quoteven the subtitle is misleading quotwriters running wild quotis not accurate in terms of quotwritersquot nor in terms of quotrunning wild quot while zelda fitzgerald did indeed have a natural talent and did indeed later publish a novel during the s she did not consider herself a professional writer as to quotrunning wild quot one incident in the life of edna ferber does not meet most people s definition of quotrunning wild quot especially when every other description indicates a disciplined workaholic those looking for some insight into literary lives hoping that will transfer to greater understanding of their works will be disappointed those familiar with the lives of these authors will not find anything new those wishing to be titillated may enjoy it 
big disapointment i was very disapointed in the book basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others twisted their words and put his own spin on it it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down there are good books out there written by people who were there i suggest you take a look at those i read many good one s but this book wasnt in that catagory 
unpatriotic hodge s quotredefining european security quot does not even dwell upon the fundamentals of defense and military strategies its a hodgepodge of basic definitions cut and pasted from some of europe s local newspapers and from quotunnamed sources quot truly the european experiment most notably britain while less drastic in it s security failures was discouraging this is in complete contrast to hodge s conservatist bias 
where s the poker if you are looking for a book to read about poker pass on this one unless you are desperate for any poker read do so for a very simple reason there is surprisingly little about poker in this poker book there is a detailed account of ted binion s murder which courses through the book in fact there is much more about binion than about poker but this book was not found in the mystery section of the bookstore it was in the poker section or you might like some insight about going to a jewelry store to pick out an anniversary ring for your wife this is covered in more detail than mcmanus coverage of his wsop satellite tournaments in fact the author s wife jennifer s ring size is six a fact which for some reason i can t get out of my head but the book was not in the weddings anniversaries section of the bookstore it was in the poker section are you curious about mcmanus childhood his parents and grandparents then this is the book for you although it would usually be found in the autobiography section there is even a fascinating endless chapter on whether a alvarez should have had intercourse with sylvia plath and whether such coitus would have interrupted her eventual suicide our author thinks not but we all know it depends but this book was not in the self helpforsickpoets section of the bookstore it was in the poker section in all seriousness i could go on and on with examples such as these it s not a bad book in fact the sections on poker are really quite good if the author had edited out three quarters of the book i would give it five stars when i go to the poker section of the bookstore and buy a book about poker i want my goddess poker to be the topic if you re looking for one person s experience with poker mostly but not exclusively in vegas read anthony holden s big deal it s a great read and it s even about poker 
stars decent starting point for cooking impaired college students if they don t mind eating eggs and potatoes often a little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do what is the purpose of using cornstarch i know some of it is common sense but heyyyyyyy i m a stupid college student for example for one recipe for frying chicken i used pork and it tasted fine also some of the recipes don t really work baking chicken drumsticks at degrees in the oven for minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken on the upside the cooking tips were really helpful the book could use more of those like be aware that if you heat oil it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm overall this book provides some ideas but i wouldn t rely on it too much not really worth the purchase flip through it in the bookstore like i did and save some bucks for uhhh buying food 
really old and outdated techniques this book turned out to be another release of the original book from the s and it shows it is full of seriously outdated information and old style pushy boiler room style telemarketing tactics worst of all it tells you to always push for the appointment and end the conversation there what about qualifying i can already set appointments all day if i don t bother to qualify them but unfortunately those unqualified appointments don t buy save your money and find a more up to date sales book 
mediocre i read this book it was okay but the story flashed back to much and i couldn t folow all of it but i read all of it anyway i wouldn t recommend it too slow moving and boring because of the flashbacks the movie was the same way 
a waste of paper i thought this book was very unrealistic and insulting for one thing the girl s name is spelt wrong i had trouble finishing off the book because it was so boring overall i thought this book was a waste of paper 
so drawn out boring and predictable alright already from the very beginning i knew where this book was going and unfortunately bagshawe took pages to get me there i was expecting a great read after just finishing her novel adored which i adored i m not giving up on bagshawe yet though and will attempt another of her books her writing style is comfortable and it s an easy read but the plot developed after just a few chapters and the rest just drudged along a predictable course 
what the writing was very disjointed in my opinion i had to read and re read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say it was a struggle to read no likeable characters i made it to the part where it was introduced that madeline slept with the ex husband and current wife give me a break ! i moved on immediately too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale 
mildly entertaining but predictable the cover blurbs mentioned plot twists mystery and suspense in fact it s very linear and spoiler alert everything happens exactly as you think it will i kept waiting for the twists but they never came i like books about athletes athletic team dynamics and youth sports issues so this looked appealing not a bad read but pretty ho hum 
a book without structure one expects one s textbooks to present material in a structured way this book is all over the place it is full of references to material quotcovered in the next section quot or quoti explain this later in the book quot it is also full of incomplete sentences spelling errors and uncoordinated subjects and predicates for failness sake on  must admit that some useful information may be gleaned with some effort 
a painful and slow read this book reads like a graduate thesis it manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length but i recommend not finding out for yourself spend your money elsewhere 
surely not noir simply an unanswerable mystery king certainly lends a high profile to this collection of latter day noir writing and tough guy procedurals but i believe he created something a little too far outside the readership s expected genre for this series the setting and characters are recognizable now trite staples of his beloved maine coast and he works at bringing their down east mannerisms to life with language that rings of bert i lobstermen i wasn t particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen s tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach and the ending well um the ending is definitely an open ender king cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won t appeal to many readers yep you got that right stephen no gunplay no boozers no saucy dames no double crosses no slangy patter no real satisfaction for me i suggest hard crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy hitters from the past 
potentially good plot but sloppily written this is a book by ja jance this book took a potentially good storyline plot and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style which is unlike ja jance this book seemed to be to be written for a young adult reader audience i had to force myself to read it all the way through because i must admit i was curious as to the conclusion but i did not derive any pleasure from reading this book a waste of time 
if you have any sort of hard science knowledge don t bother this book is obviously written by someone who is scientifically challenged basic astronomy math ecology etc do not add up this is especially unfortunate since the characters were created so well they were people who were real complex mixtures of strengths weaknesses inconsistancies virtues stupidites etc in fact the characters and basic story were so well done that i pushed on in the book much further than i should have hoping that bad science would go away and i could enjoy the interaction of the people but alas after a hundred or so pages i could take it no longer 
disappointing i was looking for a book of nielsen s outstanding and unique art work well this isn t really it if you are looking for the same you will be disappointed with the cheap printing poor resolution and lame detail what makes nielsen s art so beautiful and interesting are his patterned details and gorgeous lines but these pictures are so small the details are lost i m assuming the original out of print editions of his work would be the only other place to find these illustrations what a shame 
broken i gave this cookbook stars because although it was exactly what i was looking for it came in an unacceptable condition my mother had the original book for as long as i can remember and it had become well worn pages were falling out of it this book was for all intesive purposes the same when i gave it to my mom for christmas she was so excited unfortunately the three ring binder on it was broken this is very bad considering that you need them to turn the pages i would say that considering it was brand new this was unacceptabl 
readers are spoonfed this one i was soooo disappointed with this one that i had to quit reading i felt that the authors insulted my intelligence as a reader no depth in its characters no real plot such trite writing ! i was really excited to see a story that incorporates a fun chicklit genre with cooking and recipes unfortunately i couldn t stomach the characters or the way the authors spoonfed the story to me very condescending i too am wondering how this book was published 
toxic writing this book is so one sided that it s nearly worthless stauber and rampton accuse the pr industry of presenting cooked facts to convince the public ironically they do the same thing just on the other side of the coin 
blechhh just browsed the opening chapter online in the new criterion the words pompous sententious and bombastic don t even begin to do justice to kimball s overlabored prose you would need to reach for appropriately grand phrases like pseudomediterranean wind 
barely entertaining i can t understand how this book won the world fantasy award touted as horror it was barely scary lieber filled his book with a string of impossible coincidences then pulled a rabbit out of his hat at the end avoid 
oh my god this books starts with such promise but i find it hard to believe that the people who wrote the glowing reviews were actually able to slog through it ! minutiae fest 
everything that rises must fall flannery o connors novel is a blending together of nine short stories all independent of one another working together to achieve a common goal in my opinion if i have read books in my life this book does not make the top no single story was very appealing making it nine slow starts and nine mediocre finishes to give a more objective view of the book it was written in a third person omniscient point of view o connor takes a somewhat cynical approach toward each of her characters in their descriptions the flaws of each character are pointed out rather than the virtues these are some of the more obvious styles that o connor uses in the stories various devices are used among these are flashback imagery and hyperbole each of these individually contributes to the overall story without these devices the point o connor was trying to make would not be as solid the overall theme in the book seen throughout the stories is a need for personal change each protagonist goes through a series of events and detailed descriptions of what is wrong with everyone else only to point the finger at themselves at the end the moral of this is that rather than trying to pin our problems on others maybe we should take responsibilities for our own flaws if from what i have said you still wish to read the book by all means go ahead many people have liked this book but i am quite convinced it is not my style 
mailer sucks i ve never liked anything this unpleasant man has written but this one takes the cake it s worse than his previous worst novel ancient evenings which single handedly turned me off for years on all things egyptian no i m not some outraged evangelical railing at someone making use of my lord n savior i think jesus is fair game and a fine topic for literature and speculation but i m not going to do as so many others seem willing to and automatically bestow praise on a book merely because it takes the sacred jesus and casts him into the harsh light of modern judgment in the gospel according to the son norman mailer proponent of the nonfiction novel figure that one out manages to make a good story dull and argumentative drains all color and life from the plot and delivers something that is so dead on arrival it s unrecognizable as the tale of jesus a biography already filled with drama betrayal false arrest torture execution and all the raw material of a gripping story i ve got to hand it to mailer not everyone could take a story ready made for adaptation all but handed to him on a silver platter like the head of saint john the baptist and then smash it down to third rate nonsense here even the devil was boring and it takes a lot to ruin the best villain ever created mailer seemed to want to absent all vestiges of christ from this little re telling of the life of the historical man jesus of nazareth and i can actually respect that but in rendering this material so skeptically humanistic as to be bland beyond tolerance puzzles me i can t say i laughed out loud at the truly bad jokes slipped in here and there amid the equally execrable prose but the line about peter was like a rock he could be broken by a bigger rock elicited a genuine chuckle that something so lame made it past an editor right after he released this work back in the late s i heard the author on npr saying in essence the gospels are badly composed there are many writers who could have written them better and i am foremost among that number mailer s ego knows no bounds and his trash talking was a little endearing i just wish he was able to back it all up with a better book than this the bottom line is this book blows skip it in favor of the last temptation of christ or read a good translation of the four gospels 
hiro s worst book i have read dilip hiro s other books which i am a big fan of and this one is terrible it is totally biased against america it seems that hiro is questioning bin laden s and al qaeda s involvement in the events he also seems to have a soft spot in his heart for the taleban regime and defends them for not turning over bin laden to the us the historical background he gives on the different nations and religion of the region is excellent and well written when the book gets into the time of the th century and later it seems that hiro sides with the radicals or makes excuses for their actions america and the west are not perfect and are part of the cycle of violence in the middle east but to totally dicredit all of our policies and actions is rediculous i do not recommend this book unless you like al qaeda and the taleban 
hated it this is sad for me because i love her other work and even though that last couple of books aren t as funny as they were in the beginning they still have a plot and they make sense i feel cheated by this series and won t be reading anymore of it i called my friends and told them not to read this the plot is just too stupid who is going to cut up a couple of nascar s and steal a hauler and seriously what guy doesn t have tools in the trunk of his car even if they are just for show then you have a dead guy in plastic wrap and you argue about what god would want you to do with him the cigar fruit stand ladies are not only annoying all the secret staying over is just ridiculous the autographing was kind of funny in the st book but in this one it was over used and stupid if you re hiding you hide in the opening of the book barney said no body cheats her and in the end she s sleeping with sam who did exactly that i am tired of media that has women taking back cheaters or worse yet begging for a second chance stupid funny isn t for me and a bag of dog poop not funny this book treats us like we are too stupid to care there is nothing but a bunch of slapstick going on i might as well have watched a stooges episode it would have been more fun there were a few times i laughed the nascar stuff was interesting but the rest of it had me calling my mom mid book and asking her to shoot me 
on beauty i was really disappointed in this book i had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book i struggled through and only finished since i bought it new and kept thinking i would find something redeeming in it 
potentially very dangerous this is the story of a very arrogant doctor who quits his medical practice because of what his quotinner teacher quot told him this could be a sign of psychosis nowhere in the books is the distinction between psychosis and psychic ever made perhaps joy does not want his readers and potential students to know the difference 
there are no specification about the shrinky dinks papers i was so disappointed when i receive the book i was hoping it has all the stuff together i mean the special paper that shrinks so i now has to buy separate and has to buy it soon cause i was planning and activity with a lot of kids too bad that does not say clearly maby moritan 
a dry and uncritical introduction zahlan covers the history of the gulf states with special emphasis on the history of the various monarchical families sadly her attitude is unflinchingly fawning she seems afraid to say one negative thing about these countries and their economic and political challenges as well the writing style is very dry and wooden her bias is symbolized by one of the maps showing the uae as extending westward all the way to dawhat as salwa at the southwest base of qatar this reflects absurdly ambitious territorial claims of the uae at a time when the saudis have claimed the coast in the vicinity of khawr duwayhin southeast of qatar this map is emblematic of the book s flaws a much better book despite its age is arabia the gulf amp the west by j b kelly 
ridiculous waste of time i had high hopes for this book i was sorely disappointed the author kept going on and on with his theories about why the roman empire collapsed every time i thought he was about to get around to some irish history he went back to rome or some other culture i can understand setting the stage but this was ridiculous halfway through i gave up skimmed the rest of the book and decided it wasn t worth the time 
if you re new to pm prepare to be confused this is easily the worst textbook i have used in my entire college career its language is convoluted and extremely confusing and its descriptions are poor at best had i read this textbook alone without concurrently taking a project management class i would have been utterly confused as to what the authors are trying to convey thank goodness i had an excellent professor to help me delve through this monstrosity 
very hard to replicate beautiful pictures but the dishes were nearly impossible to replicate and some were overly arranged food as art some of the ingredients are unavailable or overly expensive but the pictures in the book are fabulous 
the ultimate self love is self abasement there is a certain pose in these poems and it is quite effective as poses go but buddhism is not a pose nor a cloak for anger nor a disguise for preening and these well made poems have a hollow core as if the empty kettle had belched sorry i had really wanted to like it 
disappointing the plot is good but there are about pages too many why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach  case when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is we know where the precious document is another useless quest people are murdered by the half dozen the characters are outrageous most of the time improbable and i felt the semi erotic swimming episode totally stupid not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it i have read much better books than that sorry 
buy buhllmans book okay this is the first book on the subject i bought i found the instructions long and questionable i think if you want a good book buy quotadventures beyond the body quot by buhlman its much better 
not so hot the cover is by far the best art in this book there are some other good ones inside but most are incredibly poorly drawn and not very erotic at all why they bothered putting a hard cover on such an amateurish effort is beyond me even the ones that are well drawn mostly just look like normal women with wings added as an afterthought bottom line i ll snip out a few pictures to keep as art reference and throw away the rest 
don t buy anything by this guy this guy is a convicted felon and crook note all positive reviews only have one review in the history 
didn t hold up over the years what was an exciting adventure novel back in the s for a young pre teen was i ever so young on re reading now turns out to be a silly james bond knock offsummer beach book the most grating conceit is the author s habit of giving every single female charactor a clever name anna bidet french randi knickers english jemima brown african american etc it hasn t aged well 
too many errors in array design tchevysheff i teach antenna course and have found that students get confused when problems are incorrect at least problems design tchevy array with specifications that are impossible to meet the solutionary is wrong too ! the required ssl of db is never attained cause when you verify the visible region of t zdoesnt reach sidelobes zlt so don t meet for given d and n need to increase spacing or n this is serious bad training for students in addition the author use of beta for phase shift instead of alpha is missleading and confused with nomenclature for k pi lambda other aspects are very good but needs color and photos 
we should all thank ravi batra we should all be for mr ravi batri by selling enough copies of this book and its sequel quotsurviving the great depression of quot he singlehandedly prevented worldwide economic collapse 
a horrible book i do not recommend this book i took so long to finish it do not read it you will fall asleep in minutes 
horrible i am taking calc ii and am using this book this book is horrible ! i missed a lecture and when i tried doing the homework i got stuck there are no example like the examples i am here on this site to buy companion book so that i can do better on my homework i wish they would stop using this book at university level courses 
boorrrrrriiiiinng i m a grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing the story was predictable the characters were ones i feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad i kept waiting for it to get better and it didn t i skipped entire sections the ones with the radio broadcast because i was so horribly bored i read ahead and didn t feel like i missed a thing ! ah jocks turn into typical people jocks mess with girl jocks lose girl oldjocks don t get girl it s all be done before in my hometown i know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres grisham did it wonderfully with skipping christmas unfortunately this one just wasn t reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader i stick with his courtroom thrillers those take my breath away 
taunts not facts any resemblence between what is stated in this book and what s actually going on in the middle east is purely coincidental what the reader gets instead is some amazing fascist propaganda that won t truly serve anyone hirst writes for the guardian a rather famous british newspaper that took decades to establish a fine reputation for its journalism it is staggering to realize just how much damage the guardian has done to this reputation in just a short while by permitting such nonsense to invade its pages and i think we need to ask ourselves how and why this has happened the staff of the guardian has to be professional one would think that they would hesitate to destroy their paper in such a manner after all it would cost the paper money it might ruin the paper entirely and put them out of jobs one might suppose it unlikely that they would want to violate any semblence of good journalistic practice just to hurt a few jews or israelis however the experience of reading this book and seeing some of the reviews has led me to a hypothesis of what has happened the destruction of the guardian s reputation as a conduit of good journalism has not put it out of business at all just as this book has brought money to its author the ghastly articles in the guardian bring money to the newspaper if only by appearing sensational and controversial i think we readers have a duty to try to reverse this trend just as dedicated people have made great progress in the campaign against cigarette smoking the same can be done in the campaign against bad journalism we can warn our friends about books such as this one and we ought to do just that 
paperback edition blues time for a new editor there are so many publishing errors in the first paperback edition of leon kass s book that it is almost unreadable it is obvious that no one even bothered to look at the book before sending it to retail do a quick read of chapter one and you will see what i mean sentences are left entirely unfinished from one page to the next leaving the reader wondering how much other text has been omitted although page starting with the word nogoly is pretty classy my favorite example is the transition from page here dr kass is begins to frame an argument but the sentence is never completed then the next paragraph begins crudely put the argument could be stated this way what way of course the irony is all the more poignant because this series of publishing mistakes follows dr kass s meta observation about the technology used in producing this very book good stuff i would not be nearly as concerned had this book not been a god send for my present research project but later i guess i have to track down a hardback copy in the hopes that i can actually read what dr kass has written 
i kept turning the pages but was ultimately disappointed i am a john case fan and i had high hopes for this novel i enjoy novels that take the reader to different geographical places and that is one of the big things that kept me turning the pages unfortunately a disappointing ending and a main character that kept doing things that would have me close to pulling out my hair force me to not recommend this book to my friends 
not written by actual students ! and lots of inaccurate information this book isn t written by students read the fine print what a sham they get a lot of their facts wrong they boil down each school to innacurate stereotypes in the end you have barely any idea what it s like to actually go there if you look at the fine print the way they write this book is they interview students compile a transcript of the interviews often messing things up along the way send those transcripts to writers who have limited understandings of each school and who misunderstand the information in the transcripts and that s what s in this book the flawed writer s take here are complaints that have run about this book in the past the information in this book cannot be trusted to be accurate for example the write up on bryn mawr claims that students there call themselves bryn mawrians when in fact bryn mawr students refer to themselves as mawrtyrs such evidence of sloppy research makes me wonder from where the writers get their information and what else is just plain wrong i bought this book and i looked at what the book said about my college pitzer and everything you could pick off the website they got right but as one has said before me they get a lot wrong for example they say the school has two places students can eat mentioning a place called the gold mine they mention this place a number of times yet it does not exist they talk about nick names that everyone calls the dorm buildings nicknames that i have never heard another example is the big fair that pitzer has each year there is a very strange story behind how the fair started if they asked anyone on campus about the fair they would could tell them the story yet the book says its a fair celebrating the coming of spring why would a college located in southern ca with warm weather year round have a fair celebrating the coming of warm weather in the rest of the country yale kids are smarter then that arn t they i gave a three star rating because general information is put in the same place but there are a lot better books out there so unless your just skimming the book while your in a book store steer clear of this one this book is horrible they don t interview any students they haven t for over years i d stay away from this book it will give you false hope and ruin your college experience the publisher should stop running press on this garbarge it s the same exact book every single year they just update the cover give it a rest so according to this guide every school must be either a a party school where the students are inebriated a greater percentage of the time than they spend in class it turns out that the tuition and board at these schools are merely cover charges for the four years of parties and jam band concerts chances are you ll miss the majority of your classes due to hangovers so don t even bother with the academicsorb a nerd school where the social life is defined by the number of people in your study group forget parties and fun at these schools kids it s off to the library did we mention the lackluster male to female ratio funny considering they mention that for an all male school overall this is not a very helpful book to use while choosing colleges i wouldn t recommend it 
a promising title but a book that is promising a lot but just doesn t deliver at the end 
misleading totally disappointed with this book basically a list of website addresses that offer tips and information but not free stuff this information could have been easily found searhing on line and for free 
uninspired i approached this book with great anticipation after reading a glowing review i found i had a hard time sustaining interest in the book i did not find the characters to be well drawn ms o brien seemed to be so in love with her prose that i had difficulty understanding the motivation for her characters behavior this seemed more an exercise in the writing of prose than in the crafting of a novel 
only for beginners nothing could be more trite and predictable that almost every detail of above suspicion if you even occasionally read crime fiction you ll recognize every plot device and character in this novel this is a poorly written book the likes of which have been published literally dozens and dozens of times before new cop ms travis is pretty but quite self conscious she is now working a tough serial killer case her first murder investigation and she s really trying to live up to the memory of her father a great police detective even though she has zero experience in murder cases she seems to consistently make breakthroughs so the investigation can move forward any good assignment in this investigation is given to her so she can flirt and blush and simper around her boss the chief suspect is coming onto her and ooohh it s so flattering that i can t ever be sure if he s bad or good ms la plante obviously wrote this as a made fortv movie script this should be a mira book on the romance readers summer beach reading list skip this at all costs 
boring we read this book in ila and it was so boring ! the character had no emotions and it was very slow moving with no excitement i almost fell asleep don t read this boo 
polaroid nudes why would a photo artist choose a large format for polariod sized pictures that s what you get with andreas bitesnich s pola nude there is not one picture in the entire book that takes up more than half the page with approximately of the pages what you get is two polariod sized pictures side by side quarter inch white borders and the rest is black background i get so tired trying to see what the picture is about that i literally get fatigued looking at this book many of the pictures seem interesting however with much of the magic of the human form obscured by small format photos lost in a sea of black there are too few rewards to justify the price 
a terrible text this book is dreadful my students hate it and i m sorry i ever subjected them to it because it makes music and music education seem completely quotdeadquot 
disappointed after reading quotthe church ladies quot i was very excited to read another book by lisa samson i wish it hadn t been quotsongbirdquot i did not enjoy this book at all it was very depressing and sad the eiplogue was perhaps a small bright spot but overall i was very disappointed the book was a little long and when a little happiness came along in the book it would be immediately overshadowed by another bad event in charmaine s life this book was just not for me 
two words henry hazlitt you can waste your time reading this book sure go ahead or you can pick up henry hazlitt s the failure of the new economics an analysis of the keynesian fallacies and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys keynes and his faulty logic not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable keynes he shows the reader multiple instances where keynes simply contradicts himself yet keeps right on chuggin savings investments somehow in his general theory keynes manages to both prove and disprove this he explains in lucid terms that keynes general theory isn t general at all in fact it can only be applied correctly in static situations in most cases it can t account at all for dynamics don t waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
better off playing outside i did not find this workbook relevant to th th grade curriculm for science or social studies and overall way too basic for math or english at th th grade more for elementary school grade as far as a summer bridge i would suggest that you encourage your kids to playing games and activities outside or board games on rainy days than this book 
not only same old same old but inaccurate i have read all of the kennedy biographies and there is very little new information in this biography the first part has been covered in all of the others and the second part has been covered in the tabloids which makes we question the accuracy of anything here that has not been lifted from another source i noted two parts of this book that do not appear to be in keeping with what has been well documented the books states that on april caroline was in her classroom when a teacher came in and whispered to her teacher that martin luther king had been shot quick research on the web states this happened at about pm est are year olds in class at that time the books states that when visiting the white house jfk jr told then president nixon that he used to play under his desk everyone knows that the famous kennedy desk was removed when he died and not used again until it was brought back by president clinton 
a bad man i read the book because i had heard good things about it i was disgusted by what i saw i ve always been a moderate so this is not the ramblings of some right wing nut who just hates liberals ted rall hates america with an almost satanic passion after reading the book i went online and searched for ted rall s cartoons these cartoons are even worse than the book he advocates the deaths of our soldiers and makes one cartoon actually claimed that all soldiers are rapists and sadists ted rall is a sick and twisted human being do not send any of your money to this sadistic and anti american nut 
great mind series is abridged or at least incomplete another reviewer is correct in that there are significant portions of the book missing in the great minds series green and black cover in one instance i noted that pages were converted into ! also book iv chapter vii is missing parts and also quite lengthy portions of the piece go with a complete version if you re going to bother to tackle this book or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea since that may be one that they cut out ! smith may be wordy but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work shameful to nowhere state that large chunks of this classic are absent at least be forthcoming if you choose a more complete version you ll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer but still a fantastic piece of work smith does tend to try to overexplain things but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point ammendmentupon discussion with my economics professor it is possible that this green book was one of the author s first versions which he apparently edited and added to more than once i still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work to look elsewhere 
not appropriate for mba level somehow this book ended up being a required text in my full time mba program we complained so much that this was a st year college level book and not appropriate at our level that my school discontinued it the following year now i can t resell my unused version on campus what a waste 
disappointing after consuming everything hillerman has written and learning something new about native american culture from each book and after hillerman s squib on the dust jacket my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind as a arapaho amp blackfoot i had hoped to learn something about their life the characterizations were also paper thin including both the male and female protagonists and the denouement was telegraphed for miles ergo even as a mystery suspense novel this one flunked 
what s with all the kvelling so far i ve seen out of positive reviews for this book and i say hurrah for richard russo for all his positive praise however i disagree the book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns and those turns take further turns so far i m averaging to pages a night and i m a prolific reader why is russo so fearful of forwarding the plot why the back and forth the past histories upon past histories of every minor character just too much muchiness as the brits would say 
sub par performance desperation better first off desperation and the regulators is not the same story yes certain characters are used some in name only but that s all apart of the pun involved the regulators is supposedly the discovered manuscript of richard bachman about an evil entity named tak who telepathically terrorizes a small suburban ohio town through the use of a child s television heroes desperation on the other hand is about a mistakenly discovered tommyknocker not to be confused with the sk novel by the same name who can manipulate and posses other living beings in the fictitious town of desperation nv tak is also the antagonist in this prose without rehashing the synopsis of either book this stephen king fan enjoyed desperation to a higher degree than the regulators in my opinion the latter seems more of an extended short story and at no time did i find myself even remotely attached to any character presented in the material desperation however was a more enjoyable read with a deeper plot line and thoroughly developed characters if you happen to read the regulators before desperation don t fret neither book is in any kind of sequential order read one and think of the other as some sort of parallel universe 
blue light walter mosley is normally a detective writer known for his easy rawlins stories blue light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age various people in northern california are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird according to the book s cover flap the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes however in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality a smart girl becomes really smart a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess mr mosley is a talented writer his prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable unfortunately there s little balance between good and evil which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting there s a few great and captivating scenes in this book but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
almost useless as an engineering student i found this book very theoretical which makes it more difficult to read than an actual pde textbook also unlike other schaum s series this book does not have many worked out examples and does not have solutions for all the problems it is poorly organized 
didn t make it past the first pages i generally make it a point to finish every book i start no matter how awful but this was just impossible to endure inane vapid and overly sensational the book is lacking in almost every aspect the characters seem crafted for readers to hate but they lack any degree of redeeming qualities as in similar books like jilly cooper s riders the trashiness alone does not account for the poor quality but the crude insipid characters and the ridiculously stilted dialogue just make this an affront to any readers with a modicum of literary taste 
how far out there can we make this i think that that is exactly what neiderman had running through his mind when he wrote this series and book i have always loved andrews and neiderman s work i even ran a very popular vca site heck i even liked one of the miniseries the orphans series but ever since the debeers series i have liked the books less and less and i don t think it has anything to do with the fact that i read books that are truly shocking now because i still get that wonderful omg feeling when i re read the early books of both andrews and neiderman i remained optimistic with the wildflowers and shooting stars series even though i could not stand them then he lost me with the de beers series with the exception of willow because i could dort of understand her and where she was coming from in the first book anyway and even more so with this last series the gemini series has had to have been the worst series of books i have ever read and it s too bad because it could have been so wonderful i love weird and freaky stories and let s face it a girl being forced to live as a boy is pretty twisted and freaky but neiderman dropped the ball the entire story was boring it barely held my interest but i was determined to try and get through it mainly because i was hoping i hadn t wasted on a book then came the ending and it was so obvious that he was desperately trying to come up with the most shocking thing ever just to keep people interested instead i believe it had the opposite effect ill still be reading april showers but and i hate to say it if it s as bad as de beers and gemini i highly doubt that i will ever purchase another vc andrews novel and it so pains me to say that 
i get it the game of golf is racist and sexist i get it in fact i got it after the first twenty times sounes whines about it 
reads like a junior high history assignment i am an avid michael crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books crichton s writings are often full of action complexity character development as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society technology and human nature the great train robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements as i expressed in the title it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective the victorian criminal slang used although brilliantly to tell the story makes it a slow and at times unintelligible read i give it two stars because it is obvious that crichton has written a well thought out well researched book i only wish it didn t feel like i was reading his history report 
counting the trees and missing the forest i had been looking forward to reading this book because of research i m doing on a related topic i m not a catholic and certainly not a nun but i am definitely a christian and interested in how the good news intertwines with american history i was so disappointed in ms carey s approach that i felt downright cheated as a reader as another reviewer notes ms carey looses her journalist perspective in this book if there ever was any i would add certainly by page last sentence of the second paragraph it is gone entirely too bad because she has done respectable research i wondered who was paying for the book since the slantedness is so pronounced the tragedy for the reader is that the more complete compelling and difficult truths are washed out in easy toswallow platitudes the section on the sister survey has tremendous meat in it and carey should be commended for bringing data forward she fails however to put a context on the data beyond he said she said and leaves the reader to pick up on all the well placed inferences from previous chapters in short there is no in depth thinking and as another reviewer points out she reveals clear personal contempt for the changesisters as a basis for those conclusions she does draw for me the most significant shortcoming of the work is the lack of adequate consideration to what was happening to the sisters to the church as a whole in the u s its overall relationship to european mothershouses and even to rome and to the communities that the sisters had been serving significant poltical economic and social upheavals in the post wwii america cannot simply be wisked away as new age stuff it is inconceivable that these upheavals failed to act upon the individual and the community characteristics of religious women any less than they left their mark on americans as a whole wherehow we lived our values our music our hopes or lack thereof the notion that the decline of religious sisters groups is due to internal struggles between persuasive change sisters and apparently passive traditional sisters albeit sparked by vatican ii is so naive as to be stunning yet that is the message that ms carey brings home more than once even viewed with the narrow inward looking perspective that dominates the book no serious consideration was given to the problem of how women religious communities were faring economically what had caused their economic crises and the impact that community economics had on the outlook of the sisters blaming the dilemmas on changing from traditional habit to secular clothes is not a sufficiently comprehensive answer for me one psychologist not a reveiwer has suggested that one of the possible reasons why social justice was of such interest to many of the new sisters is because their own situation was so unjust delve into the on againoffagain mostly way off support provided to women religious vs priests in some diocesan areas and one wonders how justice was served at all clearly that s a whole book unto itself finally ms carey s work seems to belie a preference for euro dominated orders as the ideal although never stated like that if that is correct then it helps make some sense of why change sisters are so abhorent in her view sort of like some british still preferring to think of us as the colonies not coming from that tradition i d have to say that i don t share her notion i feel that ms carey put together a goodly amount of data and then proceded to count the trees instead of seeing the forest or well beyond 
very bad the first impression of the book was positive but it started to become increasingly complex and confusing i though about having misunderstood something but many others share my opinion this book is poorly written crap and going through all pages is waste of precious time authors ignorance is revealed when he speaks about any economics topic for instance mergers are presumably inflationary gee you may believe it or not but no wonder the author is ex banker off the mainstream front porch philosophy is clearly a stronger of his skills 
propaganda i have never read such bull in my life as an educator with her recent masters in education i debunk greene s theories i suggest reading actual research done by phd s and educators such as a r sadovnik h kohl r p mcdermott j bettie m a gibson m polluck fine weis powell r rist j o neil to name a few when jay greene has read from all of the experts above spent a few years in schools doing the work of an innovative caring open minded teacher and interviewed students from underpriviledged back grounds then he can write a book about schools our students are not sick patients and our schools are not hospitals yet greene sticks to this metaphor in order to make his reader s think that education is something as simple as a broken toy in fact education is about teaching our children to become critical thinkers something greene does not want his readers to do 
the epitome of depressing eighties writing this is going to be short but sweet this book was by far one of the most bothersome collections of short stories i have had the misfortune to come across with authors such as robert lipsyte diane duane and richard peck this is hardly what i would call a selection of great work from great writers for that matter it isn t a collection of anything but chronologically trapped short stories featuring such characters as craig the cat the rock star who dressed like a cat and held a bottle of spilling milk while posing atop a garbage can for magazine shoots the biggest problem with this book is that the stories are oriented for pre teens but to find any value or worthwhile messages in the book you would have to be at least sixteen oh the sweet irony as a young teenager i feel that this book was a complete was of time g day 
anxious billy bully infant mentality from o reilly this time in context we all know who you work for billy boy history will tell and you know it 
lost fans don t bother choose watership down or other fans of the abc tv show lost will probably be buying our mutual friend in droves after having seen desmond keeping it to be the last book i ever read since i did not have to buy it having purchased a full set of dickens years ago i immediately set out to read it what a disappointment it was ! dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a month period one cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is just a bit perhaps padded any good editor could have tightened it up at least pages dickens work is melodrama but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art as oscar wilde said of the old curiosity shop i simply cannot read of the death of little nell without laughing omf goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence even worse is the ending some endings just can t help but feel contrived and dickens having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions pulls so many strange colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated all of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for the complete oxford illustrated dickens but i assure you that my only concern is for you gentle reader unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of dickens oeuvre or are required to read our mutual friend i would instead direct you to dickens far superior works david copperfield oliver twist pickwick papers if you are looking for lost reading material i would refer you to watership down excellent the stand by stephen king entertainment not literature the dark tower series by stephen king entertainment not literature and similar to our mutual friend possessed of a fatally flawed ending or a review of philosophy like locke rousseau and hume namaste and good luck aka redemption isle on thefuselage co 
read like a cookbook i bought this book as a text book for a college course i was extremely dissappointed because the style in which mr edwards writes is an excellent example of what a text book should not be i wondered if i had bought the clif note version i felt this book was written like a cookbook it left a bad taste in my mouth and i wanted to throw the recipe away i felt that mr edwards book was an excellent example of quoteasy way out quot management he limited the examples in the text to only the those he used and left an impression that all of his decisions were correct i would like to ask mr edwards if he felt he was successful in running the pg county fire dept using the discussed methods i would also ask if he felt the dept was in better shape after his tenure as chief if you are interested in learning to manage fire service personnel you may want to read this book because of the limited information on the topic but if you set it down after the first ten pages dont be suprised i have seen toast that wasnt as dry as this book 
the formula is getting old jack du brul is a good writer he actually is a very good writer but he also is a clive cussler clone and that may not necessarily be a good thing his hero philip mercer is a carbon copy of dirk pitt as a matter of fact du brul is acting as ghost writer for cussler latest installment of his oregon files series his books are good entertainment this one is a little exhausting by the end of the book mercer has gone around the world at least three times unfortunately you are so tired you don t even care of the outcome anymore the plots are also kind of dislodged there is a plot line that starts in area that never gets resolved anyway if you like the cussler stile du brul fits the bill but i would try some of his other offerings like the medusa stone or pandoras curse instead of this one 
what a joke what s wrong with all you amamzon reviewers i actually quite liked shutter island but this was total garbage the morose tone is totally overdone throughout and the end is pathetic the interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story avoid 
not sure what he s trying for if you read this book looking for ways that your product company or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with tipping point gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn t at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated he builds up a theory of things needing to be sticky which is fine but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory anyway the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he s a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none theless 
thanks but no thanks first somewhere on amazon com i read that the pictures in this book are full color they are not i did not find this book helpful at all as far as showing the pictures to my son while he sits on the toilet he has no interest in looking at these cartoon people i ve never seen a kid have less of an interest in anything in my life 
do not waste your money this is quite possibly one of the worst books i have ever read it drags on like a rusty knife for far to many pages the book could have been good could have saved itself if it had ended on page instead of page the story after is irrelevant pointless lacks continuity and ultimately leaves the reader wondering why it was included instead of the sad story of the young writer you end up with that plus a monologue in which the author attempts to build sympathy for himself justify his existence and generally prove that at he amounted to something 
the book is not complete and at times can be misleading being a student of photojournalizm in moscow russia i looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available i had studied one book on the subject by the russian author but knowing that photography in the us is much more developed and professional i was striving to get a book by a professional photographer i was disappointed by the book photographic composition by tom grill for a number of reasons it does not cover all important compositional elements and those that it covers are not explained in full detail it does not explain how elements with the similar shapes similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other the reverse perspective effect and its uses why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why how it can be used on practice how to balance weight of different elements of the photograph it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example difference between compositional center and the center of interest how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo does not match each other all signs of perspective it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective trivial as it may sound it still should be marked in any complete work especially when the author covers other three elements and much much more it does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic neither does it show how composition works in art which i believe is very important most examples are in color while most ideas on composition are best explained using b w photographs last but not least composition is about meaning making a message not just how to balance different elements within a frame the book makes this statement but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good overall i believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations not just a few and briefly explained howtoquicklyimproveanyphotoyoutake this books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading id be very grateful if you could recommend me and other folks that look at our reviews a more thorough book on composition i m sure there must be a good book in english on that subject thanks ps for those who can read in russian i advise a book by a lapin fotografiya kak which compared to the book by tom grill explains composition in full 
misses the point after using dr dyers aaah meditation cd for a month i decided that i wanted to learn more this meditation therefore i bought the book manifest your destiny the book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism there are many things that disturb me about this book dr dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book chapter or verse one of the bible quotes he uses is is it not written in your law i have said you are gods john this is the passage to which jesus referred when he said this to the pharisees who were attempting to charge him with blasphemy god standeth in the congregation of god he judgeth among the gods how long will ye judge unjustly and respect the persons of the wicked i said ye are gods and all of you sons of the most high psalms the unjust judges of israel ie the pharisees were the subject of these verses they were civil magistrates because of their authority and power and they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of israel dr dyer uses this verse completely out of context scripture cannot be broken jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are god s other laws a true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure god s word for his own purpose neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about god s word and actually expect to know god s and come into a relationship with him dr dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism the fact of the matter is that according to jesus the door to god s kingdom is narrow luke there are no shortcuts lastly a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions this appears to be a main theme of dr dyer s book those who seek god first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a gift from him we do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust god and put him first in our lives dr dyer seems to miss the point 
one case where the film was probably better this is a product of the lazy latter day leonard who knows he s a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow the onetime master of concision now takes a hundred odd pages just to set things up even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him now everybody like y know talks like uhh some kinda boob get what i m sayin the line of self parody is lying a little too close in these pages he still has a hand with the quirky minor characters though they can t carry an entire page plus novel but this one did make it clear to me why leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe one with no values or standards whatsoever here e g the protagonist is that well known figure drawn from life the friendly easygoing loan shark in your traditional crime novel chandler or either macdonald can serve as examples the action occurs against a hard edged moral framework that is at least given lip service now i won t demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play but this was a case where i finished the thing and kind of enjoyed the ride but didn t like myself for it in leonard s recent novels all that matters is who gets to take home the candy and when you get right down to it that just ain t enough 
very disappointed i finally opened this book after many years on my shelf to help me in my quest to tell my adopted kids that i have made contact with their birthmother what i read was a lot of anger stories of unsuccessful reunions and a feeling that an adopted child can never reach peace with either family i refuse to believe that is true but that is how the book comes across some points in the book are excellent but the negative was just so prevelant 
another piece of trash from fringe left cooks this is perhaps the most liberal textbook i have ever read in my entire life the authors come across as subjective and emotional espousing the evils of capitalism and taking responsibility for one s own actions 
great story awful acting while a wonderful story this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch a bit hard to understand why the child of two english parents would speak like she s from new jersey i couldn t watch the end of this it was so bad recommend you see another version 
empty stories filled with senseless plots dont look now is just one of many pointless non thriller lackluster poorly written short stories by daphne du maurier i could not find a point in any of the five stories and they all left me feeling empty dont look now was completely dim witted and anti climatic as were all the stories the breakthrough did make me question science and at how much we want to live but the characters were flat and lifeless not after midnight felt like it was going on a downward spiral to nowhere land without a point to be found a border line case left me feeling repulsed and wondering what du maurier was trying to say the way of the cross made me wonder if du maurier s way of thinking is that god gives people their comeuppance i found the shifting narrator to be irksome and it showed how little the author gave her characters varying personalities i closed this book realizing that after these stories along with rebecca that du maurier has a very monotone and bland style of writing she often goes of on pointless tangents pointless is the ever returning word when speaking of du maurier s writing i do not recommend 
amazing so butch gets his own book the question is why this secondary character introduced in dark lover has appeared throughout this series as a weak pathetic drunk the meaning of v s vision and his destiny with the brotherhood is revealed here but surely this could have been incorporated into one of the other brother s book i feel the author goes too far to justify or validate his story with the predictable storyline regarding wrath s lineage not to mention the uncomfortable relationship between v and butch with marissa caught somewhere in the middle i was unprepared by how bad this book really is butch s story ends my interest in this series but i must say i really wish this author success with her future books because the first three books of this series were awesome 
who wrote this i have read every leaphorn chee book by hillerman more than once and am a great fan i just finished this book and discussed it with a friend we both agreed it was so disappointing we cannot believe it was written by the same person the writing was awkward and heavy handed by the second page i suspected something was wrong here it reads like some cheap harlequin mystery romancethe sensitive handling of navajo spiritual beliefs the beautiful rendering of the landscape the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing all i can say is the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of tony hillerman s caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye he has given us much enjoyment he deserves better and if someone else is fleshing out hillerman s plot lines the public should be warned 
does d s know any other law schools besides harvard and yale i am so tired of her books this is it does d s know any other law schools besides harvard and yale for her characters to have attended i am so tired of her books this is it for me its the usual suspects for her rich and white quite boring i used to love her and would read anything from her but those days are over maybe she should retire 
history as teen soap opera why do we think that girls won t learn history unless it is spoon fed to them in people magazine form this book proceeds on the outlandish assumption that the yearold daughter of paul revere had a crush on leader of the revolution joseph warren years her senior and was angry at him because she thought he had a crush on her step mother paul revere s wife while there s no historical basis for any of this most of the book is taken up with the daughter s inability to tell warren that she s sorry for treating him badly with a few actual facts thrown in while paul revere s story is one of the most exciting of the revolution and in fact there s an argument there would have been no revolution without him you won t learn much about it from this book unless you already know the facts and can pick up on some elliptical references what s worse you come out of it having no idea whether any particular fact you just read has any historical basis a much better choice is in their own words paul revere by george sullivan real history and easy to read 
this probably isn t the book you re looking for if you re looking for the text of the gospel of judas you want the one edited by rudolphe kasser marvin meyer and gregor wurst and published by national geographic under isbn robinsons book is a narrative that was written without seeing the manuscript of the gospel apparently he tried to jump on the judas bandwagon with very little to go on so don t be deceived by the title 
huntington samuel b had this been a paper written by a graduate student in political science it would have gotten something like a b much like other reviewers have said the book paints a cartoonish picture of you know foreign people who apparently have all the negative features one could imagine form being violent to gladly subjecting themselves to the rule of the czar as opposed to good ol westerners who are independent hard working law abiding individualistic etc etc he does not say it directly but you can discern that when he says westerners he doesn t really mean italians or portuguese he means white anglo saxon protestants leaving aside the racist eugenicist air that comes out of almost every page of this book btw what do you do with mixed race people i take issue mainly with the methodology of the work if you are a student of political science looking for a serious discussion of a theory of international conflict you will not find it here in a country where the current affairs section of bookshops is full of retarded titles like how republicans stole christmas or how to talk to a liberal if you have to prof huntington knows where success lies his book fits comfortably among these these type of works but causes giggles among real academics when discussing the causes and mechanisms of international conflict scholars generally employ some sort of statistical analysis if only to confirm a qualitative discussion there exists a database named correlates of war on which the serious researcher can do all sorts of regression analyzes and find out whether this or that factor plays a causal role in war of course this bores the hell out of the typical how republicans stole christmas reader so huntington prefers laying out arguments on the lines of caricatural paraphrase since of wars involve muslims it is obvious that muslims are bloody i have not researched this matter but from what i ve heard people have run basic regression analyzes on his theory and shattered it to pieces most of the ideas he lays out are not supported even by this type of proof for the most part he just posits stuff the vietnamese are a second hand miniature copy of the chinese core civilization romanians are some sort of russians and they volunteered to fight along the serbs against the croats of course all of these claims are delusional and they fit the image of the ignorant american who can t point louisiana on the map unfortunately these types of people sometimes get to influence us policy and periodically get this country in all sorts of trouble overall i honestly believe that george w bush has a much better understanding of international affairs than samuel huntington and that is saying something 
should be a page paper instead as mentioned by many reviewers this book has a lot of preaching about the invalidity of the concept of races what interests me to the book was the title mapping human history of this book content is in this area and if those content are condensed into a short paper it d make really good reading the whole book is a quick read the key mapping can be summarized as follows out of africa hypothesis sole source of modern homo sapiens is from africa is affirmed by genetic research first wave out of africa years ago is by sea along arabian peninsula to indian ocean which has two streams afterwards one earlier stream down oceania and a later stream up east asia mongoloid characteristics are formed relatively late years ago i don t recall anymore second wave is through sinai peninsula by land years ago and completely displaced neaderthals in middle east europe by around years ago first wave and second wave met in north central asia from different directions primarily the east asia stream entered the americas years ago but could be earlier though some genes from the me europe stream have also entered because of all these really happenned before the invention of agriculture and culture agriculture and potentially other key technologies such as use of iron privileges the groups who are the first to under go population explosion a lot of racial mixing especially on the fringes afterwards this is where jared diamond s guns germs and steel picked up if you re just interested in the mapping you don t need to buy the book save it for something else 
it gets no stars from me my professor for separations was really smart but like most chemical engineering professors that i have met they are too smart for their own good he chosed this book because it was easy to understand chemical engineering is hard enough and the fact that this book is used in most separations classes does not help each chapter starts off with an industrial example which is confusing if you re not familar with it already the authors just throw out concepts that you ve never heard before and assume you re an industry expert as thorough as the book is you won t feel like a better person after having read it the authors don t seem to want to teach the subject but rather flaunt their knowledge the most annoying thing is when the authors get to solving problems they just start applying equation after equation and don t tell the readers where they get it from sometimes it s not even an equation from that chapter or from the book i don t consider myself a bad student but i seriously could not do most of the assigned problems at the end of the book how do i become a chemical engineer then i prefer mccabe s unit operations in chemical engineering although it is not as thorough and the equations are presented differently i actually learned something and was interested in the subject matter the authors relate the theory to real life and it actually makes sense in fact i had to use the mccabe to solve some of the problems from this hellish book 
no redeeming features this is a very bad book it is poorly written the characters are caricatures in misery and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter who suffers in silence after the devastating and to her mysterious death of her mother her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter he is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child s behavior which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion he fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break i couldn t finish this it is drivel 
text heavy poor editing and design i picked up this book after reading the great one page summary in outside magazine my suggestion is to go and buy the january issue of outside magazine and read the great one page summary the summary has many of the best suggestions from the book but it is concise and well edited the first thing that struck me as i glanced through the book was that is consists of pages of almost pure text with very few illustrations and no photos as i started plowing through it i noticed that the prose was littered with an inordinate number of asides and parenthetical comments consider this gem so we tend to think runners are better than we are and because they don t really fight the image probably more out of preoccupation with their hamstrings than egocentrism in their defense that keeps a lot of us who doubt we re ever going to rule at anything from running at first i assumed that the author was a exercise physiologist who just couldn t write but then i realized he is a journalist who writes too much the book is actually pieced together from articles that appeared in outside magazine and it reads exactly like one huge magazine article the problem is writing a good book is a lot different than writing a good magazine article i would say that about percent of the text could be deleted with no harm done the production design of the book is especially poor it focuses on style rather than substance the few illustrations are wasted on highly stylized drawings unsuitable for a technical topic there is almost no variation in font size which makes it difficult to pick out main points there are no chapter summaries and precious few bulleted lists there are some good points in this book if you can find them the book covers a wide variety of topics and i did find a few things potentially worth adding to my workout most people especially beginners would be better off looking elsewhere 
something interesting about the other reviews i read the glowing reviews listed for dr katz s book but noticed that all the reviewers seem to come from just two places salisbury md and the new haven ct area katz of course teaches at yale which is located in new haven maybe he is from salisbury or has a lot of friends there in any case it is very suspicious that in a huge country such as the usa the reviews for a book come from only two locations statistically it is possible but then it is also possible for a monkey to write hamlet 
roughly written morris lamb dies suddenly of what appears to be plant poisoning his plants when his house is sold to an episcopalian priest and her deaf dog companion starts to have seizures holly winter dog writer and lover starts to investigate i have enjoyed this series that takes place in cambridge ma im definitely a dog person and these are definitely dog lovers books filled with all kinds of tips and tidbits on dog companions i was extremely disappointed in this one however the writing is choppy the characters that haven t already been introduced in previous books are underdeveloped conant often seems to babble i didn t really understand how her opening statements about aliens and ufo s had anything to do with dogs the dog lover s mysteries have been a favorite of mine so i m going to give it another chance and read the next one but i wish someone had told me earlier not to waste my time on this one 
where was the editor that robert coles heart is in the right place and that his experience working with children is extensive no one can dispute but his writing is characterized by wordiness even chattiness and it undermines the serious nature of his topic perhaps the loose writing style is an attempt to make the book appeal to quotevery parent quot and not just educators but instead it renders the whole work laborious and permeated with a condescending patronizing tone in the current political culture a book on the moral life of children written by an educator of coles calibre would be expected to nail a spot on the n y times bestseller list for weeks if not years the fact that less than two years after publication i picked up a hard cover copy at a book clearance for off is a testimony to lazy editorship more than anything else what a huge loss for our society 
don t waste your time i very much looked forward to the ending of this book not to see what would happen but so that i could be done with it and move on to a different book ! i found this book pointless after reading pages i can t even think of two adjectives to describe sally and clare moody does such a poor job of character development that i don t feel like i know all that much about these two women i did not like the main characters and i didn t feel as though they had much of a real friendship at all the book is way too long the plot is unbelievable the characters are unlikable and the writing style is annoying 
good pictures text leaves a bit to be desired this book reads a lot like an entry level psychology textbook where you get a taste of what is about to come but you never quite get there the author has gone to some great pain to provide you a psychological overview of what various signs and symbols mean in regard to freemasonry instead of taking the symbology at face value as most people would do the author has read between the lines and interpreted what is really meant by the working tools and so forth of the craft my impression is that much of the interpretation is a bit far fetched case in point the author states on page this collection of symbols and particularly their proximity to the place in the temple where divinity is said to reside indicates that a master mason in the sense that we are defining him is a person who is conscious at a psychological level which relates to the world of the spirit in the same way that our ordinary ego is conscious of the body and the physical world overall this book is a rapid fire snapshot of many works of art regarding masonry but the emphasis is more orless on a pseudo psychological impression that one man has attempted to define and apply to the craft the message throughout the book seems a bit juvenile for such a strong subject the text is well written though and has found a place on my bookshelf if for no other reason than the pictures that accompany the text the photographs throughout the book make it worth buying if no other reason applies 
inflammatory there are better books out there on the subject the things that most struck me was the book was more attacking than setting up positive models i found the language to be quite inflammatory and harsh this made it very unpleasant to read for a much better book on house churches try houses that change the world by wolfgang simson 
not that useful i have read many adoption books and found this one to be the least informative many other better books available for less money 
oh danny boy first off i love dan rather he s a wonderful passionate man whom i love to watch on the news the problem is he s not a writer not a very good one at least this book is a noble attempt but there is just so much that s wrong with it for one thing there is just some bad writing in it it has a lot of errors in fact and a lot of typos among others he writes that texas a m university rather than texas tech is in lubbock and he says that ryne sandberg in in the baseball hall of fame he just should be soon there is also bad grammar this is beyond the texas colloquialisms in the book which i think are fine im a texan myself these are fairly small problems but they are oftly annoying and they are not good signs in a book written by a journalist who s supposed to report facts furthermore he just has few narrative talents at least not those required for a book he tells the stories as a journalist on headline news would concise to the point and without much flavor they re just there the reader is rarely drawn in the most glaring flaw though is that there are a lot of flaws in logic in the book for instance one of the stories is about a ten yearold boy who realizes that many of the underpriveleged at his school cannot afford school supplies so he works together an organization that collects and disperses those needed supplies this is all obviously a good thing but then rather relates a joke told by the boy s mother who said she needed to haul the school supplies around so she traded in her lexus for a durango and now shes getting a yukon because the durango isn t big enough my problem is the huge contrast here on one hand there are all of these kids lacking necessities and the heroes who are helping them are laughing about purchasing one expensive suv after another for themselves how is this inequality emblematic of the american dream how does this book manage to lament the rising poverty rates and terrible living conditions and still manage to promote excessive materialism there are some people in the book who are praised for having overcome hardship to make millions some of them stepping on other people s heads to do so and others who are praised for having given up millions to help those in need frankly these two ideals don t go together nevertheless these people according to rather have all attained the american dream there are a lot of contradicting ideas expressed in these stories furthermore i don t really think rather has a great concept of what the american dream is when sister sylvia schmidt founds a homeless shelter in tulsa ok i don t think she is following the american dream i think she s following dreams that go far beyond the american dream and i think she s rejecting the prevalent primarily materialistic concept of the american dream of today s society im giving the book two stars because i like dan rather and because some of the stories were rather inspiring neverthess it s not a good book i will continue to watch dan rather on tv but i m quite sure i won t read a book by him again 
convicted watergate felon decides to judge the rest of us give me a break it must be nice to find jesus in prison and then spend the rest of your life using your newfound brand of christianity to pass judgement on the world enter lies that go unchalleneged in popular culture colson s latest collection of rants about what he thinks is wrong with the rest of us who are the rest of us just about anybody who does not subscribe to his narrow point of view he has his favorites however he goes after gays and lesbians with a vengeance as he always does which makes one wonder if old chuckie has something to hide himself he criticizes the science that has proven over and over again that there is no such thing as homosexuality being in ones genetic makeup he calls it phoney science people who don t know what they re talking about often use such adjectives to describe something they don t understand but his hatred for the so called immorals doesn t stop there he encourages other christians who are reading dan brown s davinci code to throw it away aside from advocating such an infantile gesture i find it disturbing that another author would advocate destroying someone elses writing which is tantamount to censorship as far as i m concerned charles colson is nothing more than a bag of wind weighed down by his own b s he quotes scripture and interprets biblical passages to suit his self righteous agenda if there is a hell it s fires are reserved for the likes of colson and his zealot band of fundamentalist nut jobs he attacks feminist spirituality the gnostic gospels and modern popular culture in general in colson s world everyone who isn t a christian is one for the hot place and in case anybody out there reading this is wondering no i am not an atheist and i do love what jesus stood for it s his fan club here on earth that i hate think about that as far as i m concerned one has nothing to do with the other in the meantime if you want to read christian writing that doesn t regurgitate the sort of hateful rhetoric that taints everything that leaks from colson s poison pen read anything by john shelby spong or peter gomes better yet read the bible and come to your own intelligent conclusions the bible is not colson s book alone to interpret it s time someone told him that and i don t mind that i m the first 
old concepts repackaged and regurgitated all covey is saying in his longwinded book basically is this listen to the people you love put the family first in all your decisions blah blah blah and something about synergy the writing is horrible and the metaphors are overused i also dislike covey s plagiarizing material from the bible and not acknowledging where he gets his inspiration in one passage he equates the bible and other books of scripture with chicken soup for the soul as wisdom literature despite being a supposed devout mormon himself obviously he s afraid to mention the book of mormon in that passage perhaps he s afraid of scaring away potential pigeons i mean readers this was a book my book club decided to read otherwise i d have never even tried to get past the first few pages i wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give us the poor ignorant masses advice on our own families in one passage he even says that other people s advice may not apply to our own situations then how can he expect us to take his advice dont waste your money if you absolutely must read it get it from the library covey doesn t need your money he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool he s doing fine 
avoid this like the plague this is without doubt the worst book on dhtml javascript that i ve ever read the author tries to be cute funny and authorative but ends up just plain painful the examples are over long and artificial and would be difficult to incorporate into a real world application the author peppers the book with snazzy shots like its the modern way but rarely explains the benefits of the methodology he s pushing and glosses over any shortcomings for instance in discussing regular expressions he provides a simple expression for a telephone number then points out that it s seriously flawed but it s suitable for our discussion so onward we press and a correct solution is never provided bad luck if you were after such a beast footnotes abound often just urls to now broken links so you have to wonder why he couldn t have provided the solution at the bottom of the page the part on ajax is a joke he just plugs in an out ofdate version of the sarissa library and never scratches below the surface beware 
pop psychology at its worse mr jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops seminars presentations publications certifications if you ve got the money then they have something to sell you and all of it is centered around what is termed brainbased learning but what this book presents is little more than pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations for example it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and hence classrooms should be painted yellow however he doesn t offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up its all just ridiculous how does this stuff ever make it into print 
poor service product misrepresented the book we received was not the full book with the isbn number we ordered it was volume one of two with a different isbn number which was clearly noted on the back of the book we had to send the book back at our expense 
count me in the minority unlike most reviewers here i really disliked this book the main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance there is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story withinastory complexity the characters especially the protagonist iris are bores iris is like a page wet blanket most of the other characters are dimensional cut outs her sister laura is the exception but she got on my nerves too with her one note quirkiness the story withinastory is more a gimmick than anything else the science fiction meta story within that story i thought was the most interesting part of the book but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent finally this is my second atwood book and i really dislike her writing style it reads as if she is trying too hard and even the simplest situations feel forced i don t understand why everyone seems to like this book but i would just suggest not to believe all the hype 
no redeeming features this is a very bad book it is poorly written the characters are caricatures in misery and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter who suffers in silence after the devastating and to her mysterious death of her mother her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter he is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child s behavior which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion he fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break i couldn t finish this it is drivel 
no go my year old son did not like this book he said you got me a book that says i hate match but then the author says that math is great that makes no sense mom he s tried to pick it up a couple of times but it has not sparked his interest 
the golden rule works this book falls short the application of the golden rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good john maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule its worldwide acceptance and how we can apply it to our everyday it was more like a walk down memory lane to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us however i do have a few concerns with mr maxwell s book first there might need to be a better job at researching fletcher thoughts on relativism in his book he labels fletcher as the father of mordern day realativism quoting or rather misquoting fletcher s statement that love can justify anything i am in not postition to defend fletcher for i am not that familiar with his work however he does not just use the term love rather he uses the term agape love coming from the ancient greek the highest and purest form of love one that god would have for us a term any minister or pastor of the christian faith would know very well second after page the book get repediative and seems to get off track this links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track as it turns into an advertisement for mr maxwell s corporation the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of buy buybuy our products not what i expected and was somewhat disappointed in short taking some know concepts putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored part of the disappointment is that i know this book could be better 
the worst book in this series sadly this series has been in decline and has hit a new low with the cherry ceesecake murder a movie company comes to film in lake eden on the recommendation of hannah s college age sister michelle of course hannah both her sisters her neice her mother and both her boyfriends are all either cast in the movie or are working for the production company and let s not forget that that the producer and the lead actress are hannah s old college buddies whom she hasn t been in contact with for years that puts the old improbablilty drive into high gear then there are other glaring improbables like tracy hannah s kindergarten aged niece getting a major role in the movie playing a spohisticated third grader and doesn t anyone think it odd that this role wouldn t have been cast more than a day before the shooting began talk about a strained plot too many things in the book about filming the movie are just plain wrong or so unlikely as to be unbelievable that it is hard to suspend disbelief and stay in the story but the book s worst flaw is that the prologue tells who will be murdered but the actual murder doesn t take place until page the preceeding pages of back story give us plenty of tedious details about lake eden and hannah s life while only minimally advancing the plot meanwhile hannah continues to be a doormat for her mother and her dentist boyfriend s mother while she wavers between the dentist boyfriend and the law enforcement boyfriend frankly i would have cheered if she had run off with the old college friend and the series had died a natural death 
a disappointment when i read a review of this book i was interested and checked it out of the library it was a quick and easy read and unfortunately also a disappointment in author shellenbarger s favor it must be said that the book is literate well organized and based on a reasonable methodology of data collection it even has footnotes it categorizes female midlife crisis into specific types and gives defining examples of each however the breaking point is also quite superficial despite a few offhand references to jungian psychology after awhile the collected personal stories which are used as examples start to sound like a litany of airheaded people who made bad decisions dropped out of college to get married married emotionally remote men tried to mold themselves according to other people s expectations and eventually wound up paying the price the book also has virtually no perspectives that are not rooted in the last years of human experience which makes it difficult to take seriously i am a yearold woman recently retired and i find it impossible to identify with these people i also find it absolutely astonishing that anyone should find the notion of continued personal growth a radical solution to any problem this book may possibly be of assistance to women who are like those the author interviewed there is at least one piece of sensible advice herein throwing yourself into a series of sexual or romantic affairs may be dangerous to your mental health and your marriage sorry sue nice concept weak execution 
following your own footsteps in the snow crossan regards the gospel of thomas as an early primary source concerning jesus and uses it to revise the portrait of jesus found in the gospels now what reasons does he have for dating the gospel of thomas so early amazingly his whole approach to this question is reasoning in a circle it goes like this the gospel of thomas is an early primary source how do you know because no apocalyptic sayings are found in the gospel of thomas why is that evidence of an early date this is evidence of an early date because jesus wasn t into apocalyptic how do you know he wasn t because the gospel of thomas proves he wasn t why believe what the gospel of thomas says the gospel of thomas is an early primary source in his review taking the text with her pleasurea post postmodernist response to j dominic crossan the historical jesus the life of a mediterranean jewish peasant t t clark harper san francisco nt wright says this approach is like winnie the pooh following his own tracks in the snow around a clump of trees and each time he sees more tracks he takes this as evidence that his quarry is even more numerous and more real than he thought before 
what s the real price to our society lent to me cause i m such a mystery fan but i couldn t get over the fact that anne perry is herself a convicted murderer and if i bought her books i d be contributing to her profit off her murder from time when mystery writer anne perry was she committed murder she and her friend pauline killed pauline s mother perry served years in an adult women s prison after her release she left new zealand and has never returned now living in scotland perry has fashioned a new life and a successful career although family and close friends knew about perry s past it was never known to the general public including her agent and her u s publisher the new zealand film heavenly creatures deals with the case a new zealand reporter uncovered perry s previous identity as juliet hulme perry insists she does not remember specifics of the actual crime watch the documentary heavenly creatures for the facts it s just gross that she got off so light for murder and is now rich because she writes about how to committ murders she s not wise she s opportunistic 
sorry it annoyed me not that she writes poorly but julia glass completely failed to captivate me with this book it took me three months to finish it reluctantly and i didn t understand nor did i like the design of this novel three separate stories the last of which didn t connect to the first i was expecting it to all along to each her own but i found this book boring and annoying 
horrible this book is horrible it is not true to the original classic stories ! most of the endings of the stories i ve read so far are different i don t care for the illustrations either i was very dissapointed i bought this for my neices and didn t read the book until they came to visit me and by then it was too late to return this book it s basically going in the trash 
very disappointed lots of filler with little substance from the reviews i was expecting more the word discipline was used so often without giving a clear definition or clear steps of how to obtain it a lot of the meaning of this book was lost in ramblings about their authors own lives families and innate discipline mostly the emphasis was on maintaining a strict schedule and talking to yourself in your head to trick yourself into doing something yes positive affirmation can go a long way to training the mind to achieve your goals but this approach was unscientific and childish save your money 
don t bother rarely do i just write off a book especially of such a prolific writer as coetzee but this book is such an utter disappointment in his career and its only value lies in that it will prepare you for the even bigger disappointment of his most recent novel elizabeth costello which this book is a precursor i am not violently opposed to this book neither is the writing that excessively bad the book is a definition of the utter waste of time 
weak modernist take on noire novella mr auster s trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination his themes plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to european literature but the sum total of the work feels repetitive impoverished and too smart for his own good i lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity at times it seemed like endless nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist sleuth it reminds me of a much weak version of martin amis times arrow which i rather liked for all its flaws 
disappointing if you re looking for a serious approach to the topics of religious belief or life after death this isn t it it s a poor attempt by an author who is terrific at conjecture but poorly trained in the field of religious phenomenology 
an aimless book in each chapter and throughout this book the author writes whatever comes to her mind and therefore it is hard to understand where she heads and concludes what i don t know in which category this book fits but definitely not in technical anaysis 
terrible having read and absolutely loved ms gilman s hilarious memoir hypocrite in a pouffy white dress i naturally expected this book to be a great read as well i was sorely disappointed ms gilman s sassy style gets lost in a sea of trite yougogirl cliches as the pages turn gilman s voice just gets angrier and angrier every other sentence is prefaced with yeah well the writing is terrible the editing is sloppy i could go on forever grandmother s quotes were wonderful but otherwise this book was difficult to take gilman makes it abundantly clear that only as long as you share her extremely liberal views this coming from someone who considers herself moderately liberal can you make it into the goddess club after the first twenty or so pages it began to irritate me this is not a manifesto on how to cultivate some girl power and exercise it but rather an excuse for ms gilman to hop on her soapbox and rant i would suggest skipping this shallow read 
first edition is what you want not this one the book is a big disappointment i picked this book because i had bought the first version few years back and looked for an upgrade it turns out to be a new book from content style to author for instance the template tools chapter is just a recite of the man pages accompanied with poor examples and explanation is less than helpful 
predictable slow very slow book very predictable oddly written sometimes i had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd 
neither organizing nor simplicity i was disappointed with this book there were a few worthwile tips such as going to bed early to take advantage of the more productive morning hours but mostly the author solved her problems by throwing money at them if i could pick anywhere in the country i wanted to live buy coats and hire people to run all my errands hey i d be organized too ! as for simplicitythere is nothing here that anyone with even a passing familiarity with the simplicity movement would recognize 
horrible after reading inheritance of loss i immediately turn to read salman rusdie as a way of reminding myself what great indain writing is this novel is awful it seems that desai was trying to combine the writing styles of rusdie arundhati roy and rohinton mistry into one the result is an incoherent mess of snapshots of wooden characters there is not a single character that is fully fleshed out we only get snippets of some historical events that shaped who they are hence it is impossible to empathize with any of them so that when the tragic event struck during the second half of the novel i am left shrugging my shoulders contents aside the writing style is equally strocious descriptions of atmospheres and events are broken up into multiple broken up paragraphs it s almost like desai is trying too hard to introduce the fantastical elements as seen in rushdie through disjointed writing moreover there is a heavy dosage of indian idioms spattering throughout the novel but the author somehow neglected to expand the context these idioms are used this makes understanding and empathizing indian culture during the turbulent s even more difficult all in all i think this novel should be taught in creative writing classes as an example of how not to write a novel 
why not actually read the books tolkien s books are brilliant why read cheat sheets you can just enjoy the fantastic majesty of his novels 
revenge of the whale not a good book you better not read it i read this book the reveng of the whale it is about a huge sperm whale that attacks a ship that is trying to capturen it they are trying to kill it beacuse of the sperm oil it has they bring it back to land and sell it i didnt like the book becase it didnt really have a main charecter all it talked about is what the ship did and how they capiutur the whales i also didnt like it because i thought it was going to have more action in it most of the time ther just sailing and not really doing anything really exiting it also dont really have a story line all it talkes about is what the ship is doing it has no charecter conflicts i was expecting more fights seenes with the whale and i would have hopped the would have discribed the whale better and how it attacked the ship more some of the things i did like about it was it had one vwery god part in it when the capterd one of the whales it told how the got it and what they had to do to get it i also like the pictures in the book it showed what the whales looked like and all the tools they had i really didnt like this book but if you read it mabey you will u might be suprised 
a waste of time and money this book is a waste of time and money it presents nothing that two other more significant works do not already present in more accurate better edited ways these two other works are inside the white house america s most famous house the first years by better boyd caroli published by canopy books and the white house its historic furnishings and first families by betty c monkman published by abbeville press caroli has much more research experience with the white house and the nation s first ladies and momkman actually worked in the white house curator s office if it were not for sloppy editing and factually incorrect information the whitcomb and whitcomb book would be a nice addition to these two more accurate and frankly more interesting works grammatical and punctuation errors pepper the entire book and really take away from its readability worse are the blatantly wrong facts presented in this book for example on page in the chapter on lyndon johnson clark clifford s wife is erroneously called mary her name was actually marny which was a nickname for margery margery peperell kimball the authors interestingly cite clark clifford s memoir counsel to the president published by random house as a source of infomration for the chapters on presidents truman and johnson on page in the chapter about richard nixon the authors state that daniel ellsburg was a psychiatrist had the two authors consulted ellsberg s memoir secrets a memoir of vietnam and the pentagon papers published by viking penguin they would have seen that ellsberg is indeed not a psychiatrist but that he earned a doctoral degree in economics from harvard and later worked in the pentagon under secretary mcnamara the authors are undoubtedly confused there was a break in at the office of ellberg s psychiatrist a dr lewis fielding the real pshychiatrist which was a scheme carried out by g gordon liddy and e howard hunt another misconception put forth by whitcomb and whitcomb on page is that the so called white house plumbers were the infamous watergate burglars the team known as the plumbers consisted of four men liddy hunt bud krogh and david young only liddy and hunt were present at the june th break int however they were not members of the break andenter team hunt had recruited five cuban nationals and two americans one of whom james mccord worked for the cia and was director of security for the committee to re elect the president creep to go into the watergate the authors negelected to consult the most accurate account of watergate and events leading up to the infamous burglary watergate the corruption of american politics and the fall of richard nixon published by simon and schuster this book is the accompaniment to a documentary on watergate developed by the bbc and the discovery channel these mistakes make me wonder what else the authors got wrong and such factually inaccurate information really takes away from a historical work i encourage readers to consult the caroli and monkman books for all things white house as well as the independent biographies and memoirs of the presidents first ladies and their staff members eg the memoir by clark clifford instead of wasting their time and money on this sloppy attempt at historical writing 
a fraud a con man a sociopath given kerik s reported mob ties amorality and cashing in on the tragedy it s no surprise to read this con job piece of fiction his ghostwriter is probably a fiction writer because although it is well written the story is a fraud what really happened in saudi arabia he stalked and terrorized women according to the washington post why didn t mr law enforcement who claimed to be so highly skilled that he could track down the biggest drug lords in the world track down his own infant daughter the one he abandoned how about the truth he is a con man abandoned his own child is egomaniacal and is nothing more than a thug he writes about some teacher in school who told him he would never amount to anything guess what he was right bernard kerik is just what that teacher said he d be a big zero 
then ultimate un motivating guide i bought this book to prepare for running my third marathon and found it to be extremely confusing condescending and un motivating i have been running for years and have run many races somehow this book still managed to make me fill as if i was not worthy of running there are great marathon training guides out there but this is not one of them if you are looking for something that is clear and inspirational try checking out the non runners marathon trainer 
only adds to the madness gary demar s dumbed down book says every thing occured in a d demar claims that matthew word for word describes everything that was to happen and come quotshortly to pass quot in the book of revelation also the confused preterist like to say that revelation is a past event because it says shortly to pass and daniel says for many days but what dumbmar forgets is that they both speak of the resurrection so based on that the resurrection occured in a d satan on all unbelievers should be in the lake of fire new jerusalem should be on earth right now and now etc ask yourself these questions what about rev rev rev i could go on and on so based on this strict logic everything occured in a d yet the insane preterist do not seem to apply strict interpertation of revelation you can not have it both ways also he claims that nero was the beast and was a spiritual number this is obviously not true if he knew his bible he would know that one of the judgements of wrath would be sores on anyone who recieves the mark of the beast rev dosent sound spiritual to me nowhere do you find any body saying that nero and the false prophet were cast alive into the lake of fire rev not only that but if jesus did return in a d then we should be in eternity now because a d was almost two thousand years ago obviously this is not the case 
good ideas but fails to follow through the book categorizes software testing for security defects into attacks on software dependencies user interfaces design and implementation the book focuses on attacks one being overflow input buffers which form the core of the book parts and of the book explain when and how to apply each attack and what faults they find part takes a more hands on look at how to perform the testing in my opinion the book is too dependent on the holodeck program provided on the cd rather than explaining security testing in a tool agnostic way the book often simply explains how to use holodeck to perform an attack i use linux and holodeck is windows only so it was useless to me reviewer yvonne eu said the tool did not work in her test environment holodeck is currently maintained by security innovation who charge for a single user license but they also offer a day evaluation license if the version on the cd does not work for you these are your two options the book is a lot less useful if holodeck does not work for you so bear this in mind the focus on holodeck also limits the scope of the book the use of other types of tools such as web proxies port scanners and tools to exercise user interfaces is not adequately covered finally i was disappointed by chapter which looks at security testing three applications windows media player mozilla for windows and openoffice for linux this is an ideal opportunity to dive down and show how security testing tools should be applied common pitfalls and hands on techniques for finding security issues instead the chapter only explains how attacks should be planned and goes no deeper if you are new to security testing and want an overview of some common types of tests that should be run this book will be useful if you are interested in using holodeck for your testing this book will also be useful if you do not fall into these categories there are other books which are a better fit if you want more detail i recommend trying one of the hacking exposed series 
does not deliver what it promises i would not recommend this book for people who are trying to get their life together after a diagnosis of diabetes i bought this book because its subtitle is a complete guide to planning shopping cooking and eating it is none of those things i was particularly interested in the shopping promise because i find that to be the most difficult part of managing my diet other books didn t have anything helpful and despite its promise this book doesn t either one has to read through every single recipe write down the ingredients of what you want to make and then go out and get it just like every other book so tell me how does this help with shopping i expected lists of basic staples in a diabetic s diet there should be lists of musthaves for your pantry this book lies about what it contains and is sadly lacking in what it needs an expensive mistake don t buy it 
not very good i could only read an hour of this i always hate doing this to my own brethren but i can t recommend this 
not what i had hoped for i had heard of the importance and significance of the education of henry adams for a long time i finally determined i needed to read it i acutally read it twice and found less in it the second time than the first i am sorry i missed the greatness of this book i am sure there was something wrong with me but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there granted he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second rate occupants of the white house but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please a blue blooded snob like adams depresses me why did anyone bother he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery sharp tongues clever remarks and brilliant conversation the world went on without him truth be told and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day he was a very good historian in his time but who reads his books now not very many in short his own work was not as long lasting as he would have wanted it to be maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams the education of henry adams does not have much real information he got education in one place none in others surely the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry but he wrote nothing about it in his book when eric sevareid wrote not so wild a dream it was compared to the education of henry adams that was meant as a compliment oddly i think sevareid s book is much much better sevareid wrote of america the common man the war and what it all meant to him adams needed to get out more he did not see america not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together and defended it i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams again a lot of this might be me perhaps i read the book at a bad time maybe i needed to read it a third time i do not know i do know i do not think this is a great american classic forgive please my ignorance 
ok but not very detailed this book is a more a of brief review of table saw technique and jigs the chapters are not very detailed and don t actually contain any directions for doing most of cuts or processes the most frustrating thing is where he will say just use this very handy jig and then gives a very crude drawing of the jig with no explanation of how to build it or even a basic layout a much better book is kelly mehler s the table saw book 
the degree leader i am disgusted with maxwell s inability to actually write a book rather he takes quotes then compiles them in the last two thirds of his book after he puts something in earlier on do not waste your time and money on this one 
two books in one i had been looking forward to reading about the lessons learned by a blind person but i was not prepared for sunday school lessons with each learning experience i feel the book would have been much better with a little less preaching 
deceiving i too bought this book for the biscuit recipe i live more than a thousand miles away from the restaurant and would have loved to been able to make them at home i did however find a delicious if not better recipe doing an internet search save your money if you were seeking the biscuit recipe very bad business decision if you ask me i won t ever go back to the restaurant 
out of date i didn t realize how out of date this book was or i would not have bought it the book makes s era references when it comes to diet nutrition and other books about fitness he suggests that you d better plan to spend a whole dollars on a good pair of running shoes the author is readable and his personal experiences are somewhat interesting but although he is an m d there seems to be no scientific basis for his recommendations it is all based on his personal experience 
the people yes sadly chicago poems the author s first published work is the book for which self styled folk poet carl sandburg is best remembered today the collection takes a hard and unswerving look at the grim realities of urban life for the common man funneled through the flume of the author s committed socialist ideological perspective such an approach to poetry may have been somewhat novel in the america of the time and both history and critics have been kind to sandburg s sympathetic portraits of human suffering but whether he is addressing a dago shovelman an immigrant who has forgotten the dignified being his ancestors in europe or who can no longer recognize the new mown hay smell calling on the wind a street walker with haggard poems and desperate eyes or a young woman burned to death in a factory fire sandburg continually adopts the simplistic notion that the lower economic strata of society is always victimized but virtuous while governmental institutions bosses of all stripes the professional classes and the wealthy are uniformly cruel oppressive exploitive and at best indifferent thus chicago poems reads like a page polemic with a very narrow political point of view while many of the author s observations are poignantly insightful such as the poverty stricken family of a dead boy in the right to grief who are glad it is gone for the rest of the family will now have more to eat and wear the poems when read together take on an oppressively unbalanced character of their own in a fence for example the rabble and all vagabonds and hungry men and wandering children looking for a place to play stand outside the gates of a newly constructed stone house on the lake front built by a wealthy man who the poet infers can be nothing but immoral amoral or corrupt in the author s usher esque vision nothing will be able to pass through the gates to the property except death and the rain and tomorrow and tomorrow for such a corrupt individual or family will inevitably bring nothing but waves of bad conscience and fevered isolation soiled dove examines the life of a woman who was not a harlot until she married a corporation lawyer but who automatically becomes one by acquiescing to such a marriage and who soon discovers her husband also loves six other women as if marital infidelity was limited exclusively to the upper economic classes in contrast happiness is confidently represented as a crowd of hungarians under the trees with their women and children and a keg of beer and an accordion an image which may seem simultaneously nave patronizing and condescending to many readers occasionally sandburg wisely acknowledges that some portion of the tragedies of man s existence are simply inherent in the natural human life cycle the hand of god also comes in for blame in several poems chicago poems is most effective when sandburg bypasses social divisionalism as he often did in his later volumes of poetry and simply addresses the everyman in the individual while these poems are often infused with a lyrical and tender sentimentality slightly reminiscent of james whitcomb riley they also locate and acknowledge the beautiful within the tragedies that perpetually arise from human frailty vulnerability and mortality in dream in the dusk the author warns that tears and loss and broken dreams may find your heart at dusk while under the harvest moon identifies death as the gray mocker who comes to you as a beautiful friend who remembers i sang describes a lover who has given up his heart to you and the moon but only the moon remembers and is kind to me other poems have the more pronounced folk character of sandburg s later volumes the speaker in theme in yellow is the pumpkin who celebrates the paganistic dance of children around him on the last day of october singing ghost songs and love to the harvest moon i am the jack olantern with terrible teeth and the children know i am fooling the most recent edition of the complete poems of carl sandburg which contains chicago poems in its entirety is pages long and provides its readership with the full range of sandburg s original and often gloriously rich and sensual vision of life it also contains works like at the gates of tombs from slabs of the sunburnt west in which sandburg the crazy wild dreamer more fully and maturely developed his political vision comparatively the reductive often despairing chicago poems reads like the immaturely polarized work that it is 
data appears unreliable we used a previous version of this book when my first child was applying to colleges in and found it helpful the current edition was a disappointment because of obvious errors in addition to the stanford error the northwestern evaluation was completely illogical after stating that northwestern is one of the most academically rigorous schoolsin the country with an applicant pool that is easily among the best in the country the book gives an academic rating of that is the same rating given for example to st bonaventure university which ranks high on the lots of hard liquor and students almost never study lists it is interesting to note that three years ago northwestern topped the best overall academic experience for undergraduates list with an academic rating in the high s it is now ranked more than points lower since both reviews cannot possibly be correct one is forced to conclude that the authors are either biased or careless i was left feeling that i could not trust the data presented and will be using a different book for reference when my second child applies to college 
misleading repetitive and under researched it is unfortunate this book didn t come out better some glaring problems with it include has no concept of energy physics to begin with does not understand hydrogen economy hydrogens an expensive storage not a source of energy downplays geological data of oil discovery or doesn t understand it although hubbert is covered briefly believes or disseminates half baked unproven ideas from the research sector scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels does not deal with the net energy concept eroei or even refer to itwith these fundamental oversights it s really difficult to recommend the book its not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right but mostly it s pathologically impartial journalistic fluff without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should its too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil gas and coal with tar sands nuclear power hydrogen and live happily ever after to those readers who want to believe this this might be a good book people looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed id recommend books by deffeyes simmons heinberg campbell and many others before this all on peak oil 
art is great story not so much buy when paperback comes out the general feeling i had left after reading through this graphic novel was that was it costing anywhere between and bucks this title hardly pays for itself the book overall has a couple of different stories split up all set in the halo universe a good way to describe this book is it s like the animatrix short stories based in a specific fictional landscape that are at best cool and at worst mediocre the art in every one of these short stories in this book were all top notch but the shortness of the short stories just left me with again the feeling of that s it my suggestion to halo fans out there wait till this comes out in trade paperback form when it ll be about bucks then it might be worth buying 
disappointed along with other books i purchased this one to share with my and year olds i was disappointed as many of the reviews commented on the appeal of the book for younger children i would recommend this book for much older children preteensas we feel the language was too formal for our kids age range my kids absolutely enjoyed prince sidharta when i was a monkey and every breath a smile and were able to understand the stories and messages without any explanation 
pretentious moi elaine risley was bullied by her friends as a child and was scarred forever after pile up as much philosophing and moralizing as you want in the end what you are left with here is more than pages filled with a depressing middle aged woman s memories of her miserable childhood and bullying friends paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst what twaddle dreary dreary dreary 
slow reading this book was dull and i would not recommend it to someone who is not a fan of ben shahn and his work 
i don t think so if you think every man thinks the same way does the same thing has the same desires and is just lumped into one cateogry then this book will show you that peresonally i like women that are real without all of the games that we men see through anyway yeah men are visual so are women ! men like intimacy just as much as women do the title says more than the book does 
misleading i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about years however this book is misleading and dangerous almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust mr crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references to support this premise tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust i hope that someday mr crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people s thoughts and actions through his books there is a quote with great power comes great responsibility but in this case it would seem with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet 
utterly average i was scouting around for a new british crime series to start and heard good things about peter robinson so when i came across this second in the inspector banks series it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in however i and my wife both found it a severely disappointing utterly unimpressive procedural i can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes because this is utterly average stuff inspector banks has recently relocated form london to sleepy rural yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land following his first case in gallows view one day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of helmthorpe leaving banks with an old fashioned whodunit pretty quickly the stable of suspects is established his widow who inherits a nice legacy his old friend and publisher his mystery writing drinking pal his local gp and drinking pal a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago like a latter day miss marple banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements of course like the old fashioned constructions of christie we are left with lots of semi plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago meanwhile a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder placing herself in danger will banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again its all pretty bland stuff and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner the clues dovetail nicely and robinson s done a capable job of constructing a puzzler but the story and characters are instantly forgettable the writing is utterly without style or distinction and the yorkshire setting never really came alive for me it seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages all in all very little to recommend here 
disheartened i came to blowback by way of a year long research project on globalization over the past year i have read dozens of books both scholary and popular on this topic right left love america hate america multi cultural eurocentric i ve suffered through them all happily there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject first let me state that chalmers johnson this regrettable book notwithstanding is not by profession the village diot johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst a man who used to be worth listening to what happened how did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from johnson where did you go well the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge his take on america s military policies is ludicrous anyone who questions why the u s army is still in korea after years need only point to seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north where he will discover north korea of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy conspiracy theory is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated it s their sanctuary but for a scholar of johnson s caliber to go there is incomprehensible unti you see what i saw the professional works that i read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free trade and concluded more orlessnothing all in scholarly language for the most part the popular books were not nominally about globalization at all although globalization was the only thread holding the books together and to each other brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the s you underestimate the mustard gaslike effect of that era at your peril the only possible reason for these immensely angry nonsensical books is this no one fully understands globalization no one even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast too young to tame growing unpredictably every day like the blob they re frustrated these authors i can t blame them but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the ve rounded up the usual suspect america as in why does america impose dominate ignore etc the third world silly question really you re at the top of the food chain what do they expect you to do when bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else 
groomers beware this is an ok book for new people but it has several safty issues and doesn t have the show cuts for many dogs poodles it also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs there are better books out there 
unfortunately boring i m a very spiritual person and i was expecting this cd to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life unfortunately for me at least the cd is rather boring and not very inspirational i m about minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it fortunately i have a christian radio station that does a lot more for me 
vaudeville she seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i e much of today s pentecostalism charasmatics i e the toronto brownsville blessing a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic and hollywood in studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine it was just get saved and jesus loves you a cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow 
the title says it all i m a business planning consultant and a client just gave me a copy of this book way too basic not enough help on the most important part of any business plan the financials if you want to get funded look for a better book 
intially engaging but prys itself from your attention my initital impressions of american gods were nearly uniformly positive although i had not read any reviews previous i was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel but like a doomed traveler in fred pohl s gateway the book never achieved turnaround the central storyline is further and further pushed off and often seems to occur on the sidelines gaiman s prose is engaging and easy to slip into but i felt empty in the end without significant payoff or a true sense of journey those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by tim powers last call in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to gods 
pandering to the greed in all of us readers would be better served by reading the intelligent asset allocator which has the same core recommendations with regard to saving and investing but much harder data on asset allocation which provides of the explanatory variable in overall portfolio returns according to most academic studies following those recommendations instead and then going out and just living their lives instead of vainly seeking some new life around the corner if only i had another fill in the blanks million by spending their hard earned money on these investment book du jours 
holism and evolution with sanford holst s editing holism and evolution by jan christiaan smuts originally published in is one of the great and authentic visionary classics of the th century and i highly recommend to anyone interested in the subject of holism evolution and integral philosophy this book is not only one of the harbingers of today s holistic and integral movements but also continues to provide us with deep insights and powerful inspirations however this edition with sanford holst s editing is an insult to the original author and an insult to the intelligence of the readers holst adds subheadings and summaries that are utterly unnecessary while changing some words to make them quotunderstandablequot to the contemporary readers which is insulting to the intelligence and linguistic knowledge of the readers therefore my recommendation is to read the original book sold by amazon com but not this edition by sanford holst if the reader wants to enjoy an experience of reading a book by one of the truly great minds without a contamination by the hubris of a mediocre mind 
bad very bad this book had potential but the terrible character developement and choppy flow of the book blew it the end leaves you with more questions than the left behind series books do ! 
target audience the overprivileged if you re over white and wealthy this book is for you if you are someone who has dealt with many of life s hardships please do not look to this book for inspiration it is such fluff i cannot tell you how disappointed i am in it nothing profound lies within it is poorly re written and seems to me a quick way for thomas to make some money and keep her name out there written by a wealthy older white person for other wealthy older white people ps i am white 
save your money don t buy this book the magic lantern guide late though it is is a much more comprehensive book the book s title is misleading it s not a field guide a field guide would be a book dedicated to fully categorizing and explaining each of the camera s operating modes controls and menu selections this book simply regurgitates what s in the manufacturer s manual and then goes to boilerplate on how to make better photos the things unique to the nikon d are largely done by page the remaining pages is largely a generic digital photography volume all of the current dslr cameras are amazingly feature rich they have complex architecture and much hidden capability they also have capabilities that can actually get in the way if not properly understood and they have gee whiz features that are most often best left alone the manual that comes in the box explains each feature as if that feature were co equal in importance with every other feature the fact is some of the camera s feautures are very important some are less so and which ones often depend on the type of photography being done a good book on this camera would offer real world explanations and advice with respect to the long list of capabilities represented by this camera the reality is that there is little to be gained from this book that is not available from the camera manual and from the photography books that you probably already own 
don t waste your money on this book this book is nothing more than a marketing tool for the author to get you to buy more of his books seminars and products each chapter gives a taste of a marketing concept and then ends the chapter with a website to go to for more information of course these websites want you to purchase the information in the form of more books newsletters seminars etc i also purchased other marketing books at the time i bought this one how to become a marketing superstar by jeffrey j fox and your marketing sucks by mark stevens both offered complete sound marketing concepts that i ve already put to use and are showing results and best of all they didnt try to sell me anything 
it doesn t even deserve one star this was by far one of the worst books i ve ever read who in the world dreams of becoming a hooker and who in the world is a hooker while they are engaged to an amazing man and continues being a call girl even after she gets married this is one of those books that as an author has you fuming that it ever got published in the first place tracy quan must be sleeping her way through agents and publishers because this was the most stupidest story ever written 
not worth the paper that it is printed on what trash and aimless drivel you ll find more truth at a liars anonymous gathering this book is not worthy of a long retort so i will simply say that it is trash ! there i ve done it now i ve insulted trash i didn t think that was possible 
mark of the beast is money no one buys or sells without the money of the beast on in mind or hand apocalypse the correct in context translation of the classical greek word mistranslated as mark is karagma which means money you won t discover the truth about this in strong s concordance because strong s greek english lexicon is an abridged version of liddel scotts greek english lexicon same with the word mammon which also means money in the aramaic language which jesus spoke they did not even bother to translate the word because the pharisees love money see the whole context of you can t serve god money you ll either love the one and hate the other but the pharisees who loved money heard all this and scoffed the so called christians today do not follow the logos logic of god john but the trite anti christantilogoslogic of saint paul who was blinded by the light confessing with your mouth that jesus rose from the dead will not save you only logos logic will the truth will rise again nearly every great philosopher leader or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is money i e that money is an unnecessary evil stumblingblock for the blind for more information see www ismoneyco 
sophomoric and painful i had high hopes for this book they were dashed it s mostly a series of tests to determine what to do and letters about surreally unbelievable situations for this book white trash implies that burglary is the preferred career everybody has four or more husbands wives over time and innumerable dalliances beyond and any carnal urge results in children who must be taught how to burgle its just not funny and has nothing in common with jeff foxworthy or david barry writing about similar topics 
trite i had heard great things about ram charan so perhaps my expectations were set a bit high i realy got very little out of this indeed i didn t finish it this review is of the audio edition i have a bias against professional readers who don t understand what they are reading while the reading was very professional it tended to put one to sleep because the reader didn t know where the important infections were other details like pronouncing dec digital equipment as dee eee cee added to the impression 
awful textbook obviously i am a disgruntled chemistry student i will be graduating cum laude this spring and i just suffered through quantitative analysis using this book the problems do not match the examples there is little background given to the concepts described and there is no study guide that shows the methods needed to solve problems my thermal physics instructor finally gave up using another saunders book for the same reasons saunders books are more devoted to working problems than describing or teaching the processes that occur i urge any instructors considering this book to look for a different text ! 
itrash all things considered i must say this is one of the poorer hard cover book i have ever read from the standpoints of intellectual content style and misuse of the english language i have seen some lesser books in paperback but only a very few wozniak comes through as an absurd human being uncultured and obsessed with his trivial self the whole busines is trash 
some good techniques but totally off base on theory in this book bash dibra the self styled dog trainer to the stars recounts some of his experiences raising and training an actual wolf you d think this would lend a great deal of credence to dibra s training techniques and to his retelling of the now discredited alpha theory which states that the social instincts of dogs and wolves is based on who s most dominant within the pack s hierarchical structure but since this book was initially published in the early s it s now totally out of date and off base at least from a theoretical standpoint for instance early in the book dibra says you should take the alpha role with your puppy early or he will always try to dominate you but the top wolf experts don t even like to use the word alpha anymore because as david mech puts it it falsely implies a hierarchical system in which a wolf assumes a place in a linear pecking order canadian journal of zoology mech has also stated that in wild wolves dominance displays are uncommon so how can you play the alpha role with your puppy if there is no such thing as alpha and why would a puppy always try to dominate you if dominance displays are rare in nature why the disparity because it turns out that the alpha theory was based on studies done on wolves kept captive in sanctuaries not on the behavior of actual wild wolf packs who behave in a more cooperative and harmonic manner than captive wolves or most dominance trainers do dibra also says that training a dog to lie down on command is difficult because lying down is a submissive posture and dogs never want to be submissive there are two flaws in the logic here first of all the posture for the obedience down lyiing with the spinal column in a straight line head up is radicallly different from a submissive down rolling over on one side and putting a back leg up in the air that posture would not win points at an obedience trial ! meanwhile patricia gail burnham in playtraining your dog says that she saves the down for last because it s too easy again why the disparity the other flaw in dibra s logic if dogs always want to dominate and never be submissive and training them is about showing that you re dominant doesn t that describe an ongoing unending battle between you and your dog s instincts does that sound healthy happy and productive wouldn t it be better to find a way as pat burnham kevin behan and others do to work with your dog s instincts and not be constantly battling them with that said there are some good bits of training advice here don t rush the training process give your dog lots of vigorous exercise etc just keep far far away from anything that smacks of dominance the logic of that approach no longer makes any sense 
too wide incomplete and expensive after spending too much money not only you end up with rows of tabs which make it hard to find anything but some of the chapter and tables are missing 
long winded for such a thin volume i would ve loved to have this information more succinct to the point it would have made a good article unfortunately the author obviously attempted to stretch it out pad it which in my opinion makes for a frustrating read i give it stars because it does contain some useful information if you can tolerate get past the author s overstated condescending writing style 
slow paced i recently read i k and l in succession compared to innocent and killer i found lawless to be slow paced even though this edition finds kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country and the plot twists less surprising with others i ve read in the series i am usually hooked relatively early in the story line i was of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing kinsey has little contact with immediate family ergo she substitutes others in her life henry rosie pitt family the criminal elements in this book as her family i also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in l could be so dim witted on one page and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next anyway there are others in this series i would recommend more highly m being one of them 
this book is seriously dated the prof at my college chose this book as a textbook for a os course that is a mistake this book is too dry the content is dated it is simply not readable i don t know why so many people give it good rating go figure 
down in front just as in his book on orson welles thomson harbors an untoward lust to get into the act himself he is forever flapping his arms in front of the projector to throw his own shadow up upon the screen he apparently fancies himself a philosopher so we are never far from some pompous pronunciamento in america we treasure shared things as if we had a constant fear of being helplessly divided and scattered here by the way is a profound contradiction in much of americana etche is unsurprisingly cavalier enough about facts to expect to be allowed to breeze by with to be quick about this part of it the campaign of the house committee on un american activities was unconstitutional and in its punishment the blacklist it was illegal huac s campaign itself sadly passed muster via congress power to investigate just about anything it wishes to waste time on or grandstand about it was the methods that offended huac punishment was indictment for contempt of congress the judiciary did the rest on that score dutifully seeing several into the slam the blacklist was exclusively the illegitimate get of the frightened studios worst of all about this book is that whenever he runs out of cheap scurrilous time hallowed dirt to re publish thomson concocts bitchy dish nouveau of his own to serve up 
my life frying peanut butter banana sandwiches another attempt to cash in on the i knew elvis before he weighed lbs craze who really cares the man was an semi articulate imbecile who sang the same juvenile songs with inane lyrics his entire life he never grew culturally intellectually or musically although he grew quite a bit physically only in america could a hillbilly named elvis become the idol of millions grow up people the only thing extraordinary about presley was his pompadour which i believe is listed in the guiness book of wolrd records for highest silliest hair style everything else was due to colonel parker a shrewed promoter and businessman who put a moronic hick with marginal talent into a star the only brilliant talent in the equation is parker your hero elvis was a lackey 
the path to the dark side i don t know how it happened whether he was threatened bribed or just accepted a super offer from the dark side however it happened this guy has lost his way i love power vs force but i think its probably a good idea to take what this guy says fron now on with the proverbial grain of salt 
let s at least give a i m getting a little concerned about this review system because people are clearly misusing it and reports of abuse have gone ignored i am no fan of bill o reilly and this novel is not the greatest but there is no excuse for intentionally misstating the content of a book or using this space as a soapbox for irrelevant opinions especially if from the looks of some of these reviews a reviewer have not actually read this book we need to set our opinions and agendas about the author aside and review the book on its own merits re a previous reviewer s statement that under aged kids are being molested in this book by sicko the character in question was a villain who briefly appeared a young ghetto dealer who was having sex with a yearold when the hero vice cop apprehended him in fact o reilly is so busy preaching and pontificating in this scene that he forgets he is supposed to be telling a story obviously he preferred oral sex to oral hygiene thats the main problem with the novel he doesn t understand how a story is told and it doesn t appear that his editor exercised too much control over easily correctable gaffes he interrupts an arrest scene with a comment in parentheses homicide detectives are required to wear suits on duty you get the picture the details are not horribly original but nothing is stolen outright that i can pinpoint and some scenes and subplots were actually funny i have a feeling it could have been a good novel with a decent amount of editing and advice there is nothing gratuitous or intentionally in this book it is just mediocre but i did stick with it to the very end if you like media related mysteries or o reilly check it out of the library like i did fulfilling my curiosity about what kind of story someone with his background would tell was worth a few hours of my time 
pure unimaginable boredom this book has about one or two mildly interesting parts but it reminds me too much on jumanji this book was recommended to me by a friend and after reading the book i wanted to hit him ! this book was hideously boring and confusing as times once i put it down it fealt like i was taking a very heavy burden off of my shoulders i reccomend that you do not read this book 
big disappointment sorry to be a naysayer but i wish i could have seen this bookbefore i purchased it it has many pages devoted to nothing littlewords and big cartoon pictures talking to the kid about whatmight make them upset and spectulating on how upset it mightmake them the dear teachers and parents at the beginning of thebook contains the only potentially useful information in myopinion it describes an exercise for the relaxed body a littledifferent then some other deep exercises though not necessarilybetter i felt this book had mostly wasted space well i knowthat the others reviewers felt differently but that s my take 
does not live up to its potential an important note on what is graphic in this novel and what is not obviously the account of runyon setting himself on fire on pages is harrowing and disturbing but not really graphic or gory there are several references to erections some using slang some not i think those were relatively tame and mature what is graphic and disturbing is the account of runyon and his father brutal killing of a wild possum for no reason whatsoever as an english language arts teacher i have read a lot of press about this book looking back i wonder if people who reviewed this book actually read it why while it is very easy to sympathize with the author this is a memoir that falls flat of any expectations even the lowest having written that it should be noted here that one of my eighth grade students really liked this book brent runyon is an eighth grader when we he soaks his bathrobe with gasoline climbs into the bath tub and strikes the match that will leave of his body covered in burns thankfully brent manages to turn the shower on and douse the flames then he summons his older brother craig who calls and saves brent s life his subsequent recovery comprises the entirety of the narrative unfortunately this story is excruciatingly flat and extremely superficial runyon recounts his recovery in hospitals and rehabs by recounting endless inconsequential details about his surroundings and caregivers this in itself is not bad in fact i expected it as diversion from dealing with the root problem that lead to his suicide attempt depression however as the narrative progresses so do these details not until a very short epilogue does runyon address the issue of depression and only in a superficial manner as i read this book i kept waiting for insight into something anything in fact but runyon avoids issues like teenage suicide self esteem disfigurement and regretfully depression nobody in the story is redeemed no one transcends anything the experience of attempting suicide isn t used to gain insight or help other people prevent suicide or treat depression runyon s character develops into a spoiled brat enjoying the attention of everyone but resisting the attempts to help him unless attractive female nurses provide it by the last third of the book i was very bored with runyon s pity party but read faithfully until the end anyway i began the book rooting for the memoirist but by the end i found him to be an unsympathetic character now that fifteen years have passed since he attempted suicide i hope runyon and his publishers will consider another edition of this book in it they can probe more deeply into what has the potential to be a compelling and redemptive story 
very disappointed my bookclub picked this out based on the exciting description it was very diappointing the main characters colin and mary are one dimensional and seem to have very little chemistry between the two of them there were a few times in the book that i wondered if mary had multiple personalities it is unclear what their history is or what is the full story about her kids why they are vacationing there etc robert and carolyn reek of creepy creepy from the first moment that the reader meets them however they are more interesting then the main characters of mary and colin at least robert had a bit more dimension to him than the other characters the ending was the most exciting part of the book the rest just goes on and on about nothing even with an exciting ending it leaves so many holes and unanswered questions that just leave you wondering what the 
please be careful bio identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be they have serious dangerous impacts on the human body please if you are going to try these do your homework first a growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects some don t make it out the other side i am one of the lucky ones i survived the blood clots in my legs and two near fatal year long illnesses connected with use of natural progesterone since that time i have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones i hope this information will be helpful to someone else too please safeguard your health no one else is going to do it for you 
a horrible book with lots of terminologies this is a horrible book with lots of un popular terminologies and using abbreviated words i believe that we can live with quotit is likely to quot instead of quotit is prone that quot furthermore lack of descriptive volcabulary eg quotinevitablyquot had been used more than times in just one single chapter and countlessly in total 
skip this book and go to the source dr cutler barely mentions the acupuncurist from whom she learned her methods but it was probably dr devi nambudripad or someone trained by her so skip the copier and get your information from the woman who discovered a way to truly eliminate all allergies not just food sensitivities her book say goodbye to illness is packed full of testimonials some which include phone numbers and email addresses which are truly miraculous she also has a research foundation which has verified the effectiveness of her method which is called naet nambudripad s materials are much more comprehensive and there are a lot more naet practitioners around the country than there are bioset practitioners dr cutler does talk more about diet and enzymes than naet does but it is also old info you could get in any natural healing book i am disappointed i wasted my time on this book and will stick with naet 
required reading full of holes and alot of overbearing personal philosophy i found myself crossing out lines of this text as so much of this is conjecture and hyperbole the chapter on violence is worth the cost of the book however i would recommend going to the library and saving your money some directors swear by this text thusly it is a potent force in the contemporary theatre however many of these ideas have been chewed up and misused by so many inexperienced bogart groupies that it has little more validity than say a richard foreman text in its extremely self referential nature 
don t snatch it up the foundation of success in a horror story is a strong original beginning the author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief dean koontz failed to make this upfront investment in the taking the story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements stormy night body snatchers magic mirrors ghouls and koontzs favorite delphic dogs before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non denominational rapture koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror but the taking provides no such return 
what good there is undermined by bigotry though mr steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations his judgements are tainted by an anti gay bias he titles one chapter the fags and it s not meant affectionately his readings of stories such as the reaction of lorenz hart upon hearing oklahoma in a blackout could have been better informed by further research and he repeats lerner s silly comment about lorenz hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men the book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of british operettas and the public s acceptance of stephen sondheim rather than this book i would reccommend anything by ethan mordden or martin gottfried 
well written but his theories still need work i have to admit that this book is well written but it presents a very definite bias it builds a case for how modern witchcraft was invented and has no old roots at all that nothing about witchcraft today has any connection to the witchcraft of the past something that no one can prove one way or the other and hutton doesn t manage to do any differently here a close reading of the sections re gerald gardner etc even has him come close to admitting as much since everyone who was around at the time that he was using to collect his info from has proved to have not told the truth at one time or another and there aren t enough documents available to scholars to sort fact from fiction as if by putting something down in print automatically makes it so still hutton bemoans the lack of paper evidence where the beginnings of witchcraft are concerned not taking into account that there may be good reason for that and one that he perhaps should have more respect for since it is a living religion today regardless of how it got started but then disconnecting the present from the past is a bias of hutton s in all his books which are full of great and interesting and useful collections of folklore and mythology and history so that i end up reading them just for that and skipping over his actual theories and so called conclusions as they then go on to state that what we have as folklore survivals today have no real link to the rites and rituals and beliefs of the folks of the past this book is no different in that regard even if it is fixed on witchcraft in specific 
follow up on amit gupta s review i totally agree with amit s review for a practitioner s perspective bruce tuckman s fixed income securities tools for today s markets is a much better choice than fabozzi 
a wimpy superficial protagonist i wish i had read all the reviews before i bought this book the later reviews were more accurate at depicting this book at least it was for me i found the protagonist natalie raglan to be wimpy ditsy superficial and extremely indecisive she rambled on and on about what she was doing wrong but never took any action to fix it she seemed to repeat the same sentence over and over again towards the middle of the book i found myself just reading the first sentence of each paragraph just to get through it i had a very hard time connecting with natalie and understanding her decision making i gave this stars because the storyline was cute and if it was better written and if it had a stronger protagonist it could have been much much better i usually love books that are light and breezy but that doesn t mean it has to be brainless 
there s only one reason to buy this book the contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book if you want names and addresses use the internet if you want a book that can actually help you get published read the square guide to publishing your non fiction book by rudy shur 
look a little deeper the subject matter of this book is fascinating no question about it i found myself looking beyond the professional speak to try to get to the heart of the writing and to understand the treatment methods he uses discusses what really turned me off though and caused me to stop reading it completely was when he relates one instance where in the name of therapy he leans over inches from the face of one patient who by the way he treats on a bed not a traditional therapist s couch and ask do you want to kiss me although he is very careful to say i don t kiss my patients but i do permit them to express their feelings verbally as if the people he is treating are not confused and troubled enough i am certainly no professional but that alone seems like it would be cause for a lawsuit at the least or professional license revocation at the most that said there are many other books on the market with a more practical readable and sensible approach to the difficult subject of narcissism 
fast fun read not a profound book lots of story telling to make a few good points a fast and fun read 
boycott robert g allen robert g allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer if you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like i did he will send you several junk emails a day unsubscribing doesn t work and trying to block the sender s domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time the funny part is that the emails aren t even coded properly they always show up as just a bunch of html code would you really take internet money making advice from a guy who can t even code html properly anyway his spamming practices are completely illegal and it s only a matter of time before the law catches up with him but that shouldn t come as any surprise considering that mister allen has been in trouble with the law before he s had several run ins with the irs lawsuits against him and a chapter bankruptcy i would also stay away from his nothing down real estate methods many of those practices are illegal and the president of the nothing down club in atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it for more info on allen visit johntreed dottcomm click on real estate investing then click real estate guru ratings bottom line don t trust this guy and don t buy his books and if you re reading this mr allen take me off your mailing list ! 
the feeling biologist on the plus side it is good to have an advocate for the role of emotions and feelings in rational thought there can be no doubt that both emotions and feelings have a crucial role to play in learning discovery persuasion belief and insight the challenge which dammassio is not equipped or inclined to meet is to define the boundaries of the proper role of emotions in rational thought it is not clear to me how dammassio would advise members of a jury to weigh the evidence before them dispassionately or perhaps he would advise that they shouldn tdespite the eccentricity of ascribing emotions to single cell organisms i appreciate dammassio s distinction between emotions dispositions organisms adopt more or less automatically in response to stimuli which serve to promote restoration of homeostasis and feelings dispositions of the mind in which perceptions of emotions expressed in the body in turn modify those same emotions and for which mental events can also act as stimuli this sets up the suggestive and useful idea of the brainbody loop including the asif brain body loop where the stimulus is mental this conception allows dammassio to explain how the whole body participates in thinking by mediating processes in the brain a feeling causes a change in the body eg a tightening of the stomach in response to some cause of anxiety which in turn produces the sensation of that same emotion eg you feel your stomach tighten alerting you to your anxiety this is a very useful idea and needs in fact the body is able to play this mediating role in brain activity of all kinds not just feelings and emotions dammassio provides a strong argument for understanding the whole person as the appropriate unit for understanding thinking not just the brain on the minus side what is it with this mixture of positivistic almost lockean exposition of human biology based on the latest discoveries of science in the tradition of comte social darwinism ernst haeckel konrad lorenz desmond morris robert ardrey and company with on the other hand semi biographical eulogies over the seventeenth century rationalist philosopher spinoza it s like the song anddance routines put on for pre match and half time entertainment at the football i suspect that dammassio is relying on a weakness of spinoza to which he makes a passing reference namely that by simply saying that thought and extension are two attributes of the one substance the difficulty of explaining how thought arises from the activity of material beings is simply by passed for this is just what dammassio does like any number of positivists before him dammassio finds that the latest discoveries of science have at last given us an understanding of how mental images are formed all except for just that last step unfortunately but that last link in the chain will doubtless be discovered within the next decade or two dammassio has the same problem as john locke if you see thought as simply the product of one material system interacting with other material systems then you can push the boundary back further and further either by speculation or by scientific investigation but sooner or later you get to that point and you either insert the homunculus to watch the movieinthebrain as dammassio calls it or you just hope that that last step will be explained by new discoveries of modern science just around the corner dammassio is sophisticated enough to avoid highlighting the contradiction with any reference to a homunculus or a yet tobediscovered control centre somewhere in the brain so his ruse seems to be to insert a eulogy to spinoza in lieu of an explanation and these mirror neurons introduced to explain empathy are complete fiction this is not a claim that needs to be argued the idea is pure fantasy and the claim to have found the location where they to be found is outrageous no one in the field believes it mirror neurons are a disturbing step from biological explanation of biological phenomena to biological explanations of social phenomena and with that the incipient justification for medical intervention and social engineering as the cure for social problems all this could be harmless enough if the object is to improve understanding of the working of the nervous system for the purpose of curing psychiatric illness or brain injury it is a very worthwhile exercise but the mirror neurons alert us to the inevitable wider agenda for dammassio all social institutions are mechanisms for exerting homeostasis at the level of the social group and in fact all social political and ethical phenomena are extensions of these processes within the organism and have their forerunners in the social behaviour of wolves birds and so on in other words puerile social darwinism of the worst order faced with self serving navit of this breathtaking order and with obvious fictions like the mirror neurons making their appearance in what is presented as hard neuroscientific fact one is then somewhat hesitant about accepting as good coin the rather appealing ideas about the role of body maps and emotions in the mediation of thought dammassio also cleverly plays with the idea that all the phenomena of culture and human society are somehow less real than the facts of biology self aggrandizing illusions of animals who kid themselves that they have become something more thus consciousness and mind are what we call mind and consciousness this phrase what we call is used several times dammassio is clever enough not like say desmond morris to be explicit in this ploy he just suggests to the reader without spelling it out 
as an adventure the story falls miserably short the hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure suspense stories in reality the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war those readers who praise the book sky high must have some ulterior motive in mind otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book which anyways what hilton was scriptwriter in hollywood ! his other tiny book goodbye mr chips is a better read and doesn t pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book no wonder lost horizon is out of print and should remain so i don t blame the writer as much as the so called critics readers and other writers for whom the world begins in western europe and ends in north america a very myopic view ! 
i didn t like it samantha seems a lot like becky a young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn t know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions instead of staying at the firm and working out her mistake she runs away this is just like becky hiding her bills and then she gets a totally implausible job because she can t tell the truth again like becky samantha doesn t tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to i agree that the firm would never have taken her back they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care samatha like becky at times seems somewhat manic in that she s frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation just like becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared lithium anyone i don t have an opinion on the housewife lawyer controversy but i do think kinsella s protagonists need to grow up 
great story poorly developed i ordered how i stole her husband after reading all the positive reviews here and thought i would get get a fun breezy romance type novel much like you can find it in any one of jackie collins books reading it was very disappointing and rater boring and i ll explain why the main character alison takes a job as nanny for peppers year old daughter august which is lengthly drawn out over pages including all the likes and dislikes of this job also we learn that pepper seems to cheat on her husband spence spence which we know has been alison s high school sweetheart is on a business trip to hong kong and noticeable absent the majority of the time even alison states on page i had begun to think of spence as just an occasional talking point not really part of the household maybe i was wrong to begin with but i thought the romance between alison and spence was supposed to be the major plot line when he finally appears he alison and august go together to a restaurant the used to go back in high school talking about old times still no romance building up yet then the whole clan moves to new york we learn that pepper has another affair there alison spence and august go to central park together and one evening they go out to dinner without august and start kissing each other after that a few days later alison moves into spence s hotel room and a week after that she decides to leave him after finding out he had had an affair with the prior nanny too within a few days later than that she starts a new relationship with this guy finn she knew this book is more a run down of events than any kind of a romantic story everything just seems to happen for no reason i miss the gradual growing attraction between alison and spence for me that makes this book a major disappointment 
not exactly faithful during season three of the television series buffy the vampire slayer viewers were introduced to faith a bold slayer who loved breaking the rules and testing the limits a fan favorite she appeared on the spin off series angel on multiple occasions then came back to btvs during its final season faith was one of my favorite characters she was memorably portrayed by actress eliza dushku many fans wished she had her own spin off those who were loyal readers of the official btvs angel original books also wished for a book that focused solely on faith the book go ask malice is supposed to be faith s diary chronicling the time of her callling and found in the ruins of sunnydale after the series finale this means that from the get go the reader is supposed to believe that faith would keep a diary and carry it around through multiple moves from boston to sunnydale to los angeles then prison then out of prison then back to sunnydale i tried to suspend disbelief for the sake of the story but i couldn ti never stop reading a story once i ve started it but this was really hard to get through since it was a diary it was written in first person but it didn t sound like faith s voice to me i constantly wanted to correct it it wasn t one hundred percent wrong little tidbits were thrown at readers here and there things and people faith had said on the show in passing were made into plots and crucial characters but overall it never felt right for a better taste of faith fiction try the short story written by christopher golden and thomas e sniegoski in buffy the vampire slayer chaos bleeds prima s official strategy guide it is brief but powerful and you ll be wishing golden and sniegoski wrote a full faith novel instead 
filled with errors this has been a great reference book for years but hasn t been getting better instead getting filled with more and more errors the new fiesta harlequin and kitchen kraft dinnerwares the homer laughlin china collectors association book has more detailed and better pictures than any other book i d buy them both but use this one the least 
a sad waste of time and money i went out and bought this book after seeing the reviews posted here and on other discussion lists this is probably the worst book i have ever read on the subject anna riva has more credibility than this guy ! llewyllyn publishing house certainly does not seem to be bothered by the fact that they are marketing false information to the public who ever wrote in last and commented on the harmful effectd of combining traditions is correct hoodoo is not new age fantasy like the wiccan religion its a tried and true folk practice the author seems to believe that he can mix haitian loa with hoodoo and blend in a bit of jewish mysticism for kicks this book and the other llewyllyn mistake sticks stones roots and bones are both just plain fantasy 
poor the storyline is way over thetop the plot is very poor the red neckamericaknowsbest attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying still i ve red worse books but not many 
it s all a matter of faith it always amazes me how seemingly intelligent people can become so irrational when it comes to their religious beliefs this feeble attempt to show how new theories in science point to a god is nothing new ontological and cosmological quotproofsquot for god have been around for a long time and this book offers nothing new i have a phd in physics and have met many other scientists and have shared thoughts on this subject i must say the editors and sample scientists views are not representative of most it seems obvious the editors picked those scientists who held similar views sure they chose a few token agnostics the only way i could recommed this book is for a laugh and the simple wonder of how the comfort of religion can corrupt even a well disciplined scientific mind 
g is for gumshoe the second tape does not move backwards or forwards i am very diappointed 
the most horrible book this is the worst book that you can have at home it has a lot of negativism and not good things for school i have to do it a report but for me i wouldn t buy it i put start because i can t put

bit more than a kiss in the long ago far away i remember reading some of the anita blake series but being no fan of mysteries or detectives i let the series fall by the wayside if a writer is truly great then i can stay rivited even if the subject isn t one of my favorites i adore faeries to the point of practicing a post modern version of faerie faith with no rules and no boundaries and hence no obsessive traditionalism ms hamilton now has fairies with no rules and no boundaries none zip nada yet somehow this is the inverse of liberating oh i am not surprised i have something of a fetish for well written negative reviews and reading some of the erudite articulate attacks on ms hamilton s writing have been illuminating i am fully aware of the direction taken by anita blake and i knew to expect it with meredith gentry so essentially mixed blood fairy girl unseelie seelie brownie mortal or some approximation of that mess without the immortality gene runs away to escape torture at the hands of the queen of the unseelie court her aunt andais she becomes a private investigator in los angeles auntie sends a few of her bodyguards to retrieve the wayward princess meredith and bring her back to the court where the queen will make merry an offer she can t refuse part and parcel with this offer comes the requirement to have sex with the queen s guards until she conceives because a child will guarantee merry the throne merry s competing with her cousin cel who is under the same orders to produce a child and that s about it from some of the reviews here i expected a lot more sex there are a few near misses and a few actual sex scenes but they re nothing special the kink quotient is quite mild comparatively speaking even the scene that involves tentacles peters out to nothing it seems that if the character is unattractive or undersirable in any way meredith will be spared sex with this fiend at the last minute in the most contrived way possible merry apparently doesn t take any for the team the most diffecult thing about reading laurell hamilton is the way she writes her vocabulary seems very limited and the writing is quite repetitious whenever someone bites something stabs meredith the pain is described as sharp and immediate burning and instantaneous terrible and abrupt stinging and urgent im not even trying along with this limited vocabulary ms hamilton writes very much in passive voice is was were has had be been etc dialogue is also stilted and awkward with normal diction sometimes ignored to give a character an opportunity to say something witty characterization isn t a strong suit either meredith is a little dull but most heroines are her sex partners all have nearly identical personalities and i wish there had been some variety in the way ms hamilton chose to describe them rather than a run down of features and attributes so why did i read it if i knew all this in advance why did i even drop a dime on it i enjoy erotica and as previously mentioned i m a faerie fan i expected the writing to be terrible but bearable enough for a few moments of shallow enjoyment then i expected to come here slap down a single star and go on my merry way if at all possible i am even more offended by the fact the most of ms hamilton s ideas were good but she blew it by not following through or by failing to explore character emotion or by making the plot secondary to the sex to have ideas that are actually interesting and then to drop the ball is even worse than having no good ideas at all anne rice s beauty series coughcoughbut i can t give ms hamilton one star because the ideas were there shining just below the surface the idea of fairies as celebrities in the mortal world the concept of a fairie exodus to the united states old gods becoming fairies etc etc so the book gets two stars and it could have garnered more if ms hamilton had her priorities straight ms hamilton you are a grown woman mention the business parts of the male chracters by name please obscuring gential terms with him and himself makes you look sqeamish and unsure of yourself if you want to write something with a little heat and intensity clarify the act please thesaurus if you want all the sex make the non sexual parts longer so that they represent a plot why is everyone so rampantly heterosexual and horrified at the idea of homosexuality these are fairies not humans why would they possess our prejudices let meredith sleep with unattractive characters now and again refusing to do so makes her seem like an elitist snob enough complaining look at the reviews and see if this is a mess you want to wade into i ve started the second book but after the first sharp and immediate there i ve set it aside until my annoyance ends if you want a modern fairy tale try tithe it s considered ya but it s far more satisfying than merry gentry s world 
you re kidding i read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for mothers day it was the only btb book i ve read since woman of substance and i fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer ! the dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a victorian novel the heroine calls her brother brother mine oh brother ! i finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
a potent soporific this book s tongue incheek title led me to expect an entertaining and informative history of one of the world s great foods i discovered rather an informative but tediously boring history of the rural peasantry of ireland england and france in the th and th centuries i can only recommend the book as a potent soporific capable of curing the most pernicious case of insomnia if your sleep habits provide sufficient rest don t bother 
wonderful book very thoughtfully presented material the responsibility of carrying a firearm is stressed as well as the opportunity to serve those around us 
yow to open your own restaurant a loser of a guide this is a very skinny book written by two men who obviously have restaurant experience but who have very poor writing communications skills this book is not a guide to setting up the spreadsheets necessary to open a restaurant it is doubtful that the authors even know how to open up lotus or excel the amount of essential items left out are humongous watch yourself ! not a recommendable expenditure of any money whatsoever on this crummy attempt at producing a useful quotbookquot rating eight onions 
not easy piano my child has an excellent teacher and is doing very well in piano but when i showed this easy piano book to the teacher she said it was too hard for now maybe by the end of the summer maybe easy should be better defined as to what level you would have to be at in order to play this easy book 
did i miss something did i miss something clearly from the title alone dr sarno believes tension and tightening of muscles is the cause of most back leg pain where is the chapter that gives you steps to change this i didn t need to buy this book 
where s the action if you are looking for a book with action i wouldn t recommend this book though some people under age will like it i must admit i did not ivy and bean is about two completly different girls whom become best friends the reason i didn t like this book is because it doesn t have the action i was expecting if you ignore my comment read the book and hate it don t say no one warned you 
too theoratical i agreed with pareto there like him i bought this book because of the review but i was disappointed with the content of the book this book might be good for purely academic purposes i e regarding to brownian motion used to modelling cash flows not all of the material are practical for mba students some of the examples and numbers are not well explained and difficult to grasp what the author was trying to show for the same price with much more material and case studies applied mergers acquisitions is a better book if you want to gain more practical insights in this area 
i m done with baldacci since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs here are my blurbs really hard to get into tough to follow who s who opens strong but fizzles out early i literally feel asleep while reading this book one night youll finally give up without really wondering who did it 
errors errors this book allots much space to stuff you find everywhere what is a pivot table for example and on matters of conjecture and taste does a pie chart accurately portray the data for example this space could be put to better use the section most interesting to me is chapter pages creating interactive charts unfortunately there are errors some are only annoying for example on p telling us to enter sheet dates when the correct entry is sheetdate plural is a typo and no equals sign means no success simple errors but i didn t like trial and error to discover the correct entry other errors are tougher to fix as on p where we are told to enter noffsetdatesrowoffseta etc i haven t filled in all the line this procedure doesn t work at all and an explanation of how it is supposed to work is beyond the scope of the book in trying to fix it i found my own interactive graph that plots every n th point and automatically adjusts to fit the selected data is a thank you in order what can you do walkenbach explains p that changes to a pivot table chart that cause updating mean that all formatting is reverted to default he also explains that pivot table xy charts are not possible and that efforts to get around this basically are trouble this may be the most useful part of this book it tells you what can t be done bottom line this book is padded and contains errors that consume much time 
one star is too many i read my side of the mountain as a child it remained one of the few children s books that i reread once a decade or so then i read the second book not as good but sequels seldom are then i read this piece of excrement thankfully i borrowed it from the library and didn t pay any money for it mrs george takes her wonderful tale and turns it into this tiresome ham fisted tirade against business and government there s an awkward screed against one group or another in every chapter with only a few of the enlightened not tarred and feathered i used to be a fan now i doubt i ll give my niece and nephew any of her books for fear they might read this one 
old book old ideas i bought and examined this book thoroughly there are so many old concepts i wonder whether the author has ever re read its current second edition it is supposed to have been written for c programmers but of what generation i understand that the current nd edition was written after the release of ms visual c so the source code still assumes that c doesn t have the true and false boolean constants since the author defines them which causes an error in both visual c and later in fact the use of include ltiostreamhgt and void main indicate that the book is not ansi compliant the web site that supports the book provides source code for msvc only after i bought the book which is extremely expensive did i find out on the th page that it was released in but the current c standard is from i tried compiling them in msvc and msvc net none of the programs compiled none at all even after re creating the programs by adding files manually i received many many errors i tried to fix them and also tried compiling from the command prompt to no avail it is true that we don t have that many books on compiler development but just as these books are rare this particular one will be to no help it is very old and its programs don t work the only things you might get are the authors comments that may help you with some suggestions or guidance which will be little 
grrr mars and venus together forever is one of the most ridiculous stupid books that i have ever had the gross misfortune to read i probably should have expected what i got considering that mars and venus on a date left me cold but i read this one anyway because the original mars and venus book had some interesting insights and i m a sucker for a cheap book anyone who buys into the stereotypes promoted by john gray must be barmy he exaggerates overemphasises and blusters his way through the pages probably with the best motives in his mind but in the end the stuff he writes is uninspiring and insipid according to him men and women are still ruled by ancient traditions which dictate that women are all do gooder types who only desire to stay at home chatting with other women and looking at flowers whilst men are all aggressive cavemen grunting their way through their lives with zero finesse a beer in one hand and the tv remote in the other i don t see how anyone man or woman could read this book without being annoyed for women the book is terribly unempowering if you don t fit in with any of gray s ideas about what a woman should be then you are labelled as masculine i don t want to read a book which tells me that when i am at work i am moving towards my masculine side because being goal oriented competitive and efficient are male traits it s all phooey ! for men the book is also offensive john gray says that men shouldn t express their feelings because it will cause a woman to lose her attraction for him no i don t believe that men and women are the same in all respects there are gender differences but in mars and venus these are distorted overall this book is not worth your time underneath the waffle there may be some good points but all of these are outweighed by the stereotypes joann 
it s a tad on the euro socialist side but marcus isn t a bad artist i thought the art had a certain charm and used strictly as a picture book for children who can t yet read i think it s quite nice too bad you can t make up your own story to go with it the moment the child starts to read though better hide it quick because unfortunately the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids as others have noted or a socialist agenda primer i don t know for sure that s what marcus pfister had as an aim and i m not going to speculate on his politics he has three kids and may raise them as he likes and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat yes i suppose sharing is nice certainly sharing one s talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing but in america we get paid for that charity is voluntary not coerced furthermore stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting not necessarily better just unique and interesting or giving away all your possessions is a lousy way to make and keep friends isn t it is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self examination and intent to change not pandering is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad almost seems like it at least to me furthermore there s an overtone of only by belonging to a group can you have self worth which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i ve seen of course people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me but that won t make them right the two stars if you must know are for the art 
mom of after reading this book i can now see why washington state s ospi is in such a terrible state could someone please set washington s educational system free from its new age mentality 
did not like at all very surprised at the ratings on this book i thought it was very poorly written and really boring actually just the first pages were boring i gave up after that 
a total disappointment and very depressing i ve always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks and i couldn t wait to read dear john well there was no reason to rush it starts out okay but then just gets more and more depressing the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him instead of just pouting over her for most the book i cannot wait for another nicholas sparks book but only because i want to know that he hasn t lost his touch and that this novel was just a fluck 
boring as someone who loves graphic novels and who has traveled widely in asia i wanted to like this book unfortunately the vignettes lack feeling or meaning let alone structure to tie them together i suppose a comment on delisle s experience overall in the country and so at one point i was flipping the pages to figure out how much longer until the end i am giving him one star for the consistent tone of his stories he certainly conveys well his isolation and the surreal to him experiences of an extended stay in an industrial city in china since it s an autobiographical travelogue i won t attempt to separate the author s intentions from the character in the book so more stars would have gone to someone who tried to see the many encounters from his chinese colleagues points of view another star goes to the soft shadings of his panels there are some wonderful scenes like the candles in the gym to be honest i wish i could give him only half of star for the drawings since after a while the slanted eyes and buckteeth do become tired if not downright annoying delisle is one of those travelers who eats at the same place over and over and even orders the same dish over and over many of the stories reek of condescension fear or that amusement that comes from thinking they are so strange and different it s sad actually for example after three months in china he admits that he only begins to get to know his translator half an hour before he leaves the country in a few stories outright stereotypes fuel the images and the dialogue if it s intentional this depiction of an unhappy displaced individual with seemingly no amount of curiosity or compassion could be taken as a statement on westerners attitudes about china and its workers if you prefer the company of expats when you travel this book will resonate with you if you at least attempt to make connections with people in your host country then this book is a delightful guide that shows how not to travel 
your average topology student will be frustrated this text is very very difficult to read for people like me your average topology student a difficult subject to grasp the layout of this book simply does not help organize the material i have purchased several other books that while they don t make topology easy at least make it digestable pass on this book and go with munkres 
not what i thought as a student starting law school i thought that this book would give me an advantage in my legal research and writing class boy was wrong the book is full of useful information but none that realy pertains to law student it is however very basic in its approach and gives you a good start so it is not a total waste the subtitle says that the book is for nonlawyers as if somewhere out there is a person who is not a lawyer and finds legal research fun my recomendation is that if you want a brief explanation of legal research and how to do it so that you are not totaly lost when you start law school this is a good book but if you need it for some legal purpose and you are not a law student call a lawyer trust me it is well worth the fees among the books flaws is that it tells you where to go to get the information but neglects to tell you that the resources they list in the case of lexis nexis and west law require very expensive memberships and that most law schools restrict the use of their law library to students in their law school and do not even allow students from the affiliated university to use the law library as the law students in attendence at the law school require all of the resources of the library and legal librarian ad nauseum and outsiders are most unwelcome 
these bleachers are hard i was very disappointed in this selection maybe a male football fanatic would find something appealing but i was very bored ! take me back to court to the lawyer s office to the judge s chambers just about anywhere but these bleachers ! 
horrible i think this book was the boringest and dumbest book ever but i have to say that the movie was pretty good and funny so you have to give that credit 
just a waste hi i purchased this book and found out i had wasted my money by my own fault i will admit there is nothing in this book that is useful dissappointing 
poor excuse for a thriller rising sun was a terrible read crichton uses one device throughout the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him it s tiring and monotonous never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between american and japanese business cultures 
new to irving try another one first john irving remains one of my most favorite and respected authors in spite of not because of this book after reading garp cider house and a few others perhaps it is my own lofty expectations for consistent greatness that led to my genuine disengagement with this particular text many of the classic irving traits subplots interior dialogue overt sexuality encompassed the novel but the most important aspect was missing even at the conclusion of the story i could not make myself care for or truly understand dr daruwalla protagonist after something odd pages usually an aspect of irving s style that i appreciate and embrace i was ready for the novel to end and it did rather expectedly and unceremoniously this is not to say that the novel should not be read it was mildly enjoyable perhaps because i read the majority of it on the beach but as for john irving s potential it pales in comparison to his greats hesitantly recommended for the veteran irving reader is the best rating i can give this book 
obsolete this is a civilian reprint of the st b the issue version with it s waterproof pages is a collectors item and not worth much else both versions are now very outdated in much of their treatment and management of illness injury frankly when i first got the book in i didn t find it s sparse outline presentation of information very useful you can find more current information better presented in some of the newer books on wilderness medicin 
ugh i started loosing interst in the newer spider man books after this comic i found a disturbance with the second one that was more artist than story but volume s story is cheezy but spider man is still the man even if they try to change his persona and twist the story 
too predictable not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected i didn t really connect with the main characters i was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects the lights it seemed like a mystery love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story 
not much of a game mostly travel log i read some of the reviews about this book present on this site and was somewhat surprised to see mostly positive ones maybe it is just my perception or the expectation i had after reading these reviews but before buying the book that lead to my disappointment in the book what were my expectations i did expect galen to tell me what he thinks and feels before during and after taking those great pictures i did not expect a how to book which it is definitely not i expected a book about artistic approach to the outdoor photography what i found instead was mostly a travel log the first chapters were as close to my expectation as it ever got the author talked some about his creative approach and very little about his technical one the rest of the book doesn t even present his photographic philosophy he simply talks about his travels places he visited people he met all that would be great for an illustrated travel book but not for a book that was supposed to tell me about how he came to those pictures what in his opinion made those pictures great or standing out there is some of it but so little it almost doesn t exist the book s title has inner game words in it i wanted to know what that inner game was before during and after taking each picture or at least most of them overall disappointing and expensive for that 
not so great while there is some good information in this book i found the author s style disjointed and a little odd making much of the book difficult to wade through also there s a strong emphasis on ufo sightings so unless you ve got a keen interest in that subject you might find yourself skipping quite a bit of the book 
did the other reviewers read the same book that i did wow ! where do i start there were probably grammar errors in this very short book didn t the author have a proofreader you will be feeling like you wasted your with this even the free bonuses listed on the cover aren t accessible the link provided in the book doesn t work the author states in the introduction this information is going to blow your mind that it did for its lack of value the few simplistic secrets that he refers to as his little known system are all over the internet and are free he admits to being a promoter and it shows 
a lesser work i find the mostly star reviews of adam bede rather puzzling i am a great of lover nineteenth century english lit and have enjoyed the other three eliot books i ve read middlemarch silas marner and mill on the floss the latter being far and away my favorite however had i read adam bede first i may not have bothered to read other eliot works eliots talent is indisputable the other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose and many of those strengths are present in adam bede what disappointed me most about this work were the characters each was far less complex than i have come to expect from eliot and i found the saintliness of seth adam and dinah boring almost irritating it was hard to care about them i also found despite the explanations eliot provided that adam s love for hetty and dinah s change of heart about marriage was implausible what sealed my opinion of this book was adam s forgiveness of arthur after the devastation arthur s actions caused it would have been superhuman to forgive him let alone regard him as a friend when arthur asserted that he suffered more than adam i could hardly believe that adam did not recognize yet another expression of arthur s massive ego despite the book s strengths this flaw together with one dimensional personalities of the main characters relegates adam bede to an inferior status among eliot s works 
ridiculous book i like most of jodi picoult s books but this was the worse one i have ever read the story line was ridiculous and unbelievable the main character in the book trixie is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this they go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions the drawings in the book were distracting and annoying i would not recommend this book to anyone 
great book ghastly paper since when is beautiful art presented on crappy low grade glossy paper these artists are incredible and deserve so much better than this stock chinese manure it s like listening to beethoven on a s era cell phone and sadly the great doug chiang had departed the ranks of lucasfilm by episode iii 
customer review this review is not based on plot or writing skill of author the graphic presentation of the book was so unappealing and overstimulating that i couldn t even read it and returned it furthermore the fact that this was a page comic book should have been mentioned in amazon s or antone slisting 
oops i did it again a generation before there was a left behind there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c c carlson this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america a phemomenal best seller it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry for many christians their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future a generation later many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism well while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other prophecy pundits while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form for lahaye and jerry b jenkins it was the pulp novel back in lindsay and c c carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day the sensationalistic expose like most books of this type eg the bermuda triangle chariots of the gods the philadelphia experiment the population bomb it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts like most of these books it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams like most of these books it is laughable in retrospect if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong after all it was the s when wild conspiracy theories distrust of any traditional authority and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age a ufo invasion a famine around the corner and california falling into the pacific ocean the authors claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy however in the intervening years the revisions of this book just kept piling up make a bad prediction no problem edit the book with the old gaffes removed add a few trendier predictions and release it as a new book lindsey now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis carletons contribution is more stylistic despite his failed scenarios lindsey s original view was that the end times events would take place in the s he even wrote a book the s countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief well that didn t pan out so he then jumped on the yk bandwagon another of his books was planet earth a d will mankind survive oops wrong again first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam a more recent book is the everlasting hatred the roots of jihad when one bogeyman falls he is quick to insert a new one in its place between the failed predictions the hilarious misreadings of the original languages the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies right before our eyes it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs notably the left behind series of novels if you can find a copy of the original version from it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night however for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy it is best to pass for all its success as a cultural marker its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil for this its original purpose the late great planet earth is completely worthless 
more towards knitting i bought this book but i did not really read carefully this book has knitting and more knit than crochet and the crocheted scarve are nothing worth looking at yarn they use not as nice as the knit more to beginner crocheters they could of been bette 
a waste of money this ghetto dude glorifies a life of pimpin drugginand other illicit business s he spends about pages in the book talking about his so called new profession as a life coach and mentor i saw him on the news show fox thing in the morning in chicago and from the title of the book and his so called conversion from being a thug to being an honest businessman made me want to support the brother but after reading this book i wished i had saved my money i get the impression he is still probebly doing stuff that is illegal and his story is not one i would want my children or anyone i know imulating ! life coach pulezze ! there are alot of hardworking folks who grew up poor and made it without all of the activities he is glorifying in this book this book is a waste of money art 
just not enough very very basic i bought this book hoping it would go farther than getting into the front door of dming i kept reading telling myself no it is going to go into depth it is going to hit on some substance but it never did it spends too much of its time focusing on the dummy concept it repeats itself over and over again stating you are the dm you are the one that runs the game yes i know that now get on with the book i kept saying if you are a totally new dm then this book will be helpful if you have run a game a couple of times then you have probably already figured out all of the concepts mentioned here 
boring a serious snooze fest of course if you are a huge kim newman fan you ll be pleased literally every other story in the book is one if you must read this book check it out from the library at least that way you won t be wasting your money 
cheap imitation eng has a lot of facts about the life of jimmy buffett but that s about all those of us who have been fans of his since the very beginning already knew most of them too much rambling speculation about jimmy s possible ancestors eng does not have near the writing talent that jimmy does so he should not have done this bio his motivation seems to be celebrity and riches if you want to read a really good book about the life of jimmy buffet up to age quota pirate looks at fifty quot is the best book i have read in many years but what would else would we expect from a master storyteller 
a little bit dry i read through this book and found it fairly hard to digest it seems too academic for me an amateur like me probably won t be able to get anything meaningful out of it 
disappointed i had hoped for much more from my first cherry adair book the recommendations had been so good but the writing is simplistic the characters lack dimension the suspense is convuluted and not even remotely realistic and the sex is formulaic silly me to want a little romance in my romance novels ! it wasn t so bad that i couldn t finish it but i ll stick to susan andersen linda howard and karen robards for my romantic thrillers from now on 
essentially because she found religion if you are into religion this may be a good book for you if you are not it is not 
completely wrong on all reasons anyone who is looking for an economic analysis on why the imf and world bank something that should be done rigorously should be abolished should look elsewhere this book is not a condemnation of the imf and the world bank but a condemnation of free trade and capitalism he talks about how markets create inequality my response to that is so what people by their very nature are unequal with skills that are in various states of demand it is not surprising that an electrical engineer is more valuable thus gets paid more than and cashier and that a ceo gets paid more than an electrical engineer the more scarce and in demand ie valuable your skills are the more you will get paid another example is the following suppose john makes hr and jason makes hr then at the end of the year john gets a raise and jason get a raise the inequality between the two have increased but they are both better off because they each make more even more importantly though is that countries that evolved using markets the west have far less economic inequality than countries using so called planned economies i e markets do not increase inequality but centrally planned economies do he then talks about how businesses will deplete any and all resources in the name of the bottom line using the logging industry as an example no industry is so foolish and short sighted the logging industry knows that if it cuts down every last tree then it will no longer be in business so they take steps to avoid this they modify trees to grow faster plant a tree for every one they cut down and rotate through different patches coming back to the same patch of trees when they are matured thus they are able to produce on a finite amount of space without having to expand the faster a tree can grow the less space is needed to get the same amount of logging in fact forest coverage over the world has increased over that last years not only is this push for efficiency doing more with less true for the logging industry but is true for all industries and as technology improves so does the environment outrageously he says that the average worker in developed countries are worse off due to free trade any check on the facts shows this to be clearly false todays average citizen in any developed nation has so much wealth as to be incomprehensible to anyone who lived years ago in fact we live in a time of such abundance that even those who can afford cell phones cars microwaves refridgerators cable tv etc are considered to live in poverty another of his reasons on the fallacy of free trade is that none of the developed countries developed in the absence of government intervention while this is true what he ignores is that the developed countries developed in an economic atmosphere of substantially less government intervention than in the past in all of economic history all around the world governments have controlled and directed the economy but most technological and commercial advances took place when governments were weak as a result the idea of personal liberty was established during the enlightenment period when this took place the economies of the western world exploded giving them the capital to explore and develop this is the primary reason for the dominance of the west another idea about the evils of capitalism and free trade is downsizing companies downsize because they can do more with less the agricultural revolution means that or people can create enough food for or people this frees up the or people to do other things besides worry about where they are going to get their next meal today the manufacturing sector in america produces more than it did in with only of the people in manufacturing during the s this means that productivity per worker increased by more than a factor of when this occurs companies will naturally lay off workers instead of viewing this as an evil it should be viewed as what it actually is allowing labor to go where it is most needed due to the efficiency of agriculture people were free to work on other things creating the division of labor like manufacturing and creating newer and better services instead of toiling away on the farm i can t remember all of his reasons since i wasn t foolish enough to buy this book but all of his other reasons are just as weak in fact and logic don t buy this book all but or sentences are wrong 
old concepts repackaged and regurgitated all covey is saying in his longwinded book basically is this listen to the people you love put the family first in all your decisions blah blah blah and something about synergy the writing is horrible and the metaphors are overused i also dislike covey s plagiarizing material from the bible and not acknowledging where he gets his inspiration in one passage he equates the bible and other books of scripture with chicken soup for the soul as wisdom literature despite being a supposed devout mormon himself obviously he s afraid to mention the book of mormon in that passage perhaps he s afraid of scaring away potential pigeons i mean readers this was a book my book club decided to read otherwise i d have never even tried to get past the first few pages i wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give us the poor ignorant masses advice on our own families in one passage he even says that other people s advice may not apply to our own situations then how can he expect us to take his advice dont waste your money if you absolutely must read it get it from the library covey doesn t need your money he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool he s doing fine 
not a smooth read maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that i quit reading of the way through for whatever reason the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging i was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection to each their own but it is not something i would recommend 
another not very exciting lt bak story i keep trying but cannot get interested in the stories by this author they seem to drag out with her style of he said she said writing with nothing exciting except perhaps one part in this book the story begins as the famous lt bak is asked by his commander thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named minnakht his guide senna tells bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea the land is hostile and murder and death come as lt bak questions each man over and over the ending was not exciting or unexpected lt bak s constant referrals to the donkeys we know how he is sympathetic to animals this big strong medjay i had to make myself sit and finish it 
totally pointless the essays were moderately amusing but not a good use of my time if you want short amusing essays go for something like gig or i thought my father was god instead the advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful eg to keep warm eat right keep your body in shape have the right equipment to conduct a background investigation hire a private detective maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don t know how to tie a winsor knot or a bow tie but this isn t really the best way to find out because you ll never remember that the information is here and that s what the internet is for anyway 
econometrics analysis by william h greene i used the first edition of this book as a graduate student in my econometrics class the book is very confusing and hard to understand it s still of no help to me now that i am a professor and writing research paper whenever i need a review in econometrics i use judge et all quotthe theory and practice of econometrics quot it is a better book well written and easy to follow unfortunately it is off print we need a better book than the one by greene if it was for me this book should be put where it belongs in the garbage 
system safety is not an inexact science i must say that i do agree with the words of david nightengale saint paul mn that if you want to know about accident prevention go to the system safety society the book talks a lot on tight coupling or dependence of different parts of systems during different states depose design equipment procedures operators supplies and materials and environment but it all remains very qualitative safety and reliability engineers prefer quantitative approaches which are abundantly available in the area of systems reliability the author does have an attractive style of writing especially the presentation on dam failures the grand teton the malpasset and vaiont dam failures was interesting to read 
sophmoric nonsense this is a horrible example of sophmoric witty commentary paired with the idiocy of stat based evaluation if irrelevant asides were not enough they are mostly wrong as regards players from the team i follow closely the oakland a s take the notes on houston street never will be in the lidge rivera class zito overrated minor leaguer travis buck stupid comments on his name totally inappropriate ander ethier overmatached in the big leagues where their prognastications are reasonable a simple extrapolation from previous years anyone could do it in their head would suffice not some pseudo sophisticated computer program i hate this book 
have a hot plate this slender paperback has a lot to offer in the food category which is the main point the recipes were more gourmet and ethnic than i expected with a lot of new dishes even if you choose not to cook them in a tabletop toastr oven they re nice to have around for only servings as for the books toaster friendly side i m not so sure the authors give few special techniques or safety tips a must for an appliance notorious for being a fire hazard also most small toaster ovens are hell to clean making it questionable whether you d want to broil a lot of greasey things like hamburgers in them 
i listened but i couldn t hear an echo having read a few bosch books already the closers and lost light i realized that i should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how bosch became the bosch i was reading in the later series however i was very disappointed with this book one of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors mispellings and such i found or in the first pages before i stopped reading i thought it was ironic that connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book also i found the book to be too gritty it lacked the emotion and soul that i found in the later books it seemed that connelly was trying too hard to make bosch fit this certain mold but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that i read so it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because i just finished reading the narrows and loved it and will probably pick up some other bosch books and just read it out of order connelly s writing seems to be getting better and better which should explain why i didn t enjoy this book and couldn t finish it i gave it stars because it might have gotten better and maybe i was too impatient this is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order 
the spokesman for the church this book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine the only credit they gave dan brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding mary magdelene that s it the rest are just praises of how the church s version of the history makes better sense has more morality and is more ethically oriented they completely dismissed any gnostic ideas you don t need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things 
boring and inexact the recipies in this book are plain and uninspired they are also inexact in the recipie for tuna noolde casarole it calls for a bag of pasta what type of pasta how big a bag i put a lb bag of egg noodles in and tried to put it in the recomended size container didn t fit the sauce is also not nearly enough for the quantity if you use lb of egg noodles 
too basic and touching mostly on the surface stuff this book was not covered in details for almost very subject in import and export some examples are complete mismatched with the text it is over rated by other reviewer i learned about import export from the us custom web site and the internet more than the content of this book it is not worth the money or time to read 
the insufferable anna wulf like many other reviewers i struggled with this book for more than pages anna wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life this might be an interesting book for fiction writers who might understand the elaborate process anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art but for the average reader this is just too much and too long i am very patient with novels perhaps too patient because i should have put this one down sooner i got all the way to page before i realized i just couldn t go on and it s quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down doris lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with i should have taken her advice sooner but while some books you might not just be ready for i don t think i will ever be ready for this one its disappointing because i am a doris lessing fan the four gated city explores many of the same themes an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you anna wulf did have a fragmented mind as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks she was kept together by the routines of her life such as making breakfast for her daughter when she didn t have anything constructive to do she thought herself to death and if you read this book you ll likely be right there with her going crazy 
johansen is obsessed with showers the characters in this book are forever taking showers when they re not taking showers they are either planning to take a shower wishing they could take a shower or telling each other to take a shower why in the world does she make the main character kate a scant years old it s ridiculous not only does she have an md she has at least one phd and she has managed to reach the top of her field by but wait there s more ! she also during all this achievement managed to squeeze out a baby at the tender age of twenty and then raise it uh huh why does johansen not just make kate and be a bit more realistic on all counts there is a hint early on when kate muses that benny her ex husbands new girlfriend is only which makes her so much more attractive than elderly kate argh ! clearly johansen does not think a woman can be attractive at the advanced age of snore how ridiculous 
not good i m new to the shannon drake vampire series the first books beneath a blood red moon when darkness falls deep midnight and realm of shadows are excellent books ! they are well written and interesting expecially when the author recesses into the past explain how certain main characters became who and what they are having said that i must say that the awakening is awful ! yes i said awful ! i haven t yet finished the book at this point i am almost of the way through it and i keep skipping pages to get through it faster ! i have found the two main characters finn and megan to be redundant and just plain annoying ! i want to say get over it already i will read the next book which is the last in the series dead by dusk only because i have already purchased the book but if the series continues on this downward spiral i will not purchase any more 
good for browsing i ve had this book for several years but i found that it rarely had the formula i needed however it is fun to read so if you just want to get some inkling of typical problems and solutions in fields outside your own specialty then this is a good book to have 
one size fits all diet once again gary null phd recycles information into another gn book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements gary null is probably the only author that carries a phd and fails to reveal where he got his ba ma and phd a quick reading of quakwatch com shows that gary null has nontraditional credentials and owns a multi million dollar supplement company he also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters the confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables fruit and legumes would need supplements at all the only reason i could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive time consuming and costly give up so gn conveniently has dozens of vits supplements and food replacement products to fill in the gap i estimate the cost of following gn recommendations in full it would cost about per person a month to prove my point gn for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a gn healthy chocolate bar to his portfolio gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life interestingly this plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books 
very sorry i purchased this book it took a great deal of determination to finish but not any joy 
this book was far to outdated to be helpful i was disapointed when i saw the cover but figured the information would still be helpful i was wrong the list of toxins covers things not manufactured since the s it also has very minimal modern knowledge of pcos and other fertility complications skip this book it needs to be retired try the girlfriend s guide to pregnancy 
make sure you know what you re getting be warned this book has little to do with modern plagues and more to do with a left wing environmentalist agenda even worse mark walters has trouble deciding how to write his book switching back and forth between semi scientific writing and silly poetic descriptions in the end though he doesn t present the reader with anything new all of this information should be fairly common knowledge to anyone who reads a newspaper as often as once a week 
talk is for sissies cm will tell you why in pages having read all the pretty horses blood meridian and now the crossing i feel a little compelled to comment i got through of mccarthy s books because the writing technique is very good the imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take but in retrospect this book was awful the book should have been titled the crossings because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into mexico three times each time for a less compelling reason i almost expected he d make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey and while mccarthy s writing is good it s not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips the books i mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with mexico mccarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession for mccarthy mexico is the land where the upright brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food or test his manly mettle with their perfidy referring to mexico as a negligible republic and comments about being niggerrich make mccarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability a mccarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a ralph lauren model another tendency of mccarthy extended pseudo philosophical monologues by wizened codgers the pathetic thing is that the protagonist s response to these windy metaphysics is usually uh huh well gotta move long now if you have to read mccarthy read blood meridian and plan on skimming 
what you dont know this is basically a walkthrough but they dont tell you that i was dissapointed when i finally get it but thats just me its up tu yo 
undone i would just like to say that diane s recipies are not my personal favorites but whatever that marielle woman has to say is probably untrue that was rude 
avoid at all costs i am having to use this book for an accounting grad class and it is perhaps one of the worst txt books i have ever laid my eyes on ! wordy doesn t begin to describe how bad this book is did this go through an editor or straight to press it just goes on and on and on throwing in examples that come later in the chapter the examples are poor never follwing a simple path and the questions at the end of each section are as bad as the book this book reminds me of someone who decides to teach you something off of the top of their head they didn t bother to make any notes or set a goal for how they wanted to approach the subject avoid at all costs ! 
scattered repetitious vague i ve always admired norman cantor as a historian however this book is terrible it is scattered i could never tell what was coming next or how ideas fit together it is repetitious giving the same general fact or opinion over and over again as if the author couldn t remember what he d already said or had no idea of organization it is vague rarely does he get into the specific details we know of gaunt s life that would give us a true flavor of the times the all too brief section on gaunt s registers was one of the few interesting sections of the book a waste of my time and money 
made a mistake i can t forgive in his authentic buffalo hot sauce recipe he says to use tobasco he either has stock in tabasco sauce or honestly doesn t know what s in real buffalo wing sauce a lot of rub recipes and sauce recipes that are good but how can he make that mistake tabasco 
sigh hung in there through page then realized i m not immortal and don t have time to deal with this am willing to start a charitable foundation to provide ms pessl a lifetime supply of ritalin and a scholarship to the iowa writers workshop care to join me 
why i ve never understood dnd s reasoning in any of its incarnations for building the particular planar structure that it uses for all is worlds if the greeks and babylonian and all those old civilizations made up their own cosmos why did the creators of dnd think their world s needed to rip off those wonderful inventions instead of making up their own now i realize they have tried from time to time but no self respecting dm will use all the junk in this book the only useful part of this book is the planar characteristics they should have spent of the book on that and on examples then they would have gotten a star vote from me 
from info now on the internet the article that the author originally published appears as an appendix in this book reprinted in although the author is to be lauded for his breakthrough in the field the book itself is mostly light fluff about the history of the area with the meat of the text in the appendices with the original articles most of what is in this book can be found on the internet in about seconds with a good search engine looking for stonehenge astronomical alignments 
undesirable it s the polar opposite of good writing it s so familiar so conversational so unturgid and so padded with fluffy stuff it s unreadable even worse than i figured it would be oh well now i know after wondering all these years 
lisa from sgs i thought that the book was a fair read it wouldn t be worthwhile to me to read it again and it hasn t been added to the list of books i would recommend but to the author s credit it was well written i feel the ending left something to be desired and it could have used more of what was going on in the character s surroundings it became monotonous after awhile 
lame i was excited about this book then i read it at the bookstore trust me you don t want this it really looks like it was thrown together with no real reverence for the game the art the authors gygax etc 
biased outdated inaccurate and full of grammatical errors this book is a big disappointment buy this book and you will regret it first the writer is biased second the book is outdated third there are many things that are inaccurate short of fiction also the book is full of grammatical errors whatever privileges they enjoy they earned them through decades of suffering 
pauliana and the yellow brick road does ms davis live in the here and now i am a something male diagnosed with ms years ago ms davis seems to have missed her mark ! when she writes about finding your bliss is she kidding me bliss for most of us who suffer from ms would be to just have minutes without pain discomfort i won t start with a list ten minutes that s all just take away our pain body and mind just for this brief instance would be beyond any bliss you could imagine her biggest and most damaging issue is that not once does she address those of us who suffer from pain ! mostly pain in our bodies how to deal with it what to do who to turn to who is she kidding she must not an issue with pain only numbness this is understandable ms is different in each case actually if i had to choose i would have gone more twoards the numbness in the event i had to make such a horrible choice her ten steps to moving beyond should be retittled my walk down the yellow brick road and it like totally stressed me out in lean on me who is there to lean on don t wast your time with this book i only give it one star for the references made in the book i e web addresses orginizations etc it s the only reason i m going to keep the book it will be on my shelf in the reference section sorry ms davis but i had to tell it like i see it in thousands of people just ask montel williams about his pain issue 
not good introductory textbook material this is a required book for an introductory lighting class i m taking since we are solely relying on this book and it isn t supplemented with lecture material i find that without familiarity with lighting terminology and concepts it is very difficult to understand very cryptic with the seemingly overused language of the field while the author may be very knowledgeable i feel the book is not very well written and the target audience is perhaps not intended to be essentially the layman i don t find the organization of ideas and concepts to be clearly laid out or communicated well and as they unfold and i come to understand what the author is trying to say wonder why it was made so difficult is that all he means geesh and why didn t he tell me that earlier it would be easier to understand the general concept of things first even in plain english perhaps and then go on to a more technical description to learn the language of the field and get the details just seems to make simple things very complicated especially with the language flow of ideas and phrasing i also find a lot of the graphic figures and photo examples need some clarification or more details a picture s supposed to be worth a thousand words not be cryptic and time consuming to understand sorry i would not recommend this for students who are not primed first especially the younger ones 
slow wordy i really liked the first one and even went to my mom s house to pick up the second one this at at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page not much has happened to make me want to finish it very boring not really into roz and mitch characters i don t think they are very well developed they seem kind of blah and the story is kind of blah blah blah blah and just words for the blah blah blah going on and on 
another tim o brien sham another book that is written like hearing a narrative i would not recommend this bok for any reader 
not krentz s best i usually really enjoy jayne ann krentz and her alter ego amanda quick but i actually returned this one to the library unfinished i found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
pass on this one i was very disappointed in the overall content of the book very little insight into the game of football the author s view of race religion and politics added nothing but a few pages to the length of the book 
a poor book unfortunately this is a poor book and if you are a busy person i would recommend you find something else something that is well organised instead this book had poor organisation lots of grammatical errors and a ton of verbose blather with not much meaty info and badly failed my signal to noise ratio test it would be possible to strip two thirds of the words out by reformatting concisely as well taking out all the times the authors say as we are showing you i would certainly have appreciated it much more if they had been concise as my time is precious i purchased this book along with charles petzolds application code markup and essential wf and both are excellent books they are the standard i expect from professional programming books particularly ones with pro in the title ! they had a concise and structured presentation good editiorial proofing and grammar and gave me insight i could not easily get from msdn to the authors sorry to give your book a bad rap but it s true and you can produce better work i m sure of it also you should get a good editor who will catch grammatical errors and stop you being self indulgent and bring your focus back to what the readers want which is not to hear you say hundreds of time as we are showing you 
another waste of money and time this is another example of someone trying to make money by marketing old ideas in a time when the ethanol industry is on the verge of a major contribution to alternative fuels the trouble with this book and so many others like it is that the author has not updated the book to keep up with technological advancements in the alternative fuels field this book is totally useless in the st cenbtury unless maybe you own a edsel with a carburetor 
dreadful i believe this is the second worst book i ve ever read although having not bothered to finish it it had potential to rank higher on the list the concept the characters the plot and the writing were so far fetched that it was too difficult to suspend my disbelief long enough tolerate reading it i never give up on books i read them to the end no matter how much i dislike them leaving a book unread haunts me throwing out a book is a cardinal sin in my mind i made an exception in this case and tossed it in my garbage can and felt no guilt the writing is poor there is no eloquence no wit no attempt at a remotely believable plot the humor is not humorous it s an attempt at slapstick comedy that falls short of its goal it is too obvious too tiresome and often just plain bizarre the book was recommended by a close friend who enjoys award winning books i assumed she d be on target with this one she obviously likes hiaason s books and find them funny and involving but simply put theyre not my taste or to my liking find something else to do with your time something more satisfying and mentally stimulating than reading this book i ve never dared to try another of his books since being so annoyed by lucky you so i cannot speak for them this one might have been an anomaly in his body of work although i honestly don t know but i feel like i wasted my time with this and to be honest if i were given a choice between reading this book and snorting dirt i d choose the latter 
not what i expected the book is good if you do not know anything about thyroid disease the book was not worth the money that you pay for i 
nothing new i was hoping this book would help us all get a better nights sleep but it s the same old quotcry it out quot method we ve all heard about not our style 
avoid if you have a working brain actually i would give this book no stars but there s no tab for that lets begin with the title to chapter who needs n ggers i asterisked that so it wouldn t get edited out he of course spells it out that should pretty much wrap up the essence of this fabulistic screed of pseudoscience limp wristed white racism anti semitism and a surprising anti christianity this epistle to the mindless is at least written so that its target audience can read it it is an endless series of single paragraphs i am presuming this is so it can be read with one s finger pointing out each word and thankfully for that same audience there aren t any big words either if as a previous reviewer said this is the second greatest book ever written obviously that dick and jane reader was the only other book they ever read and slowly at that what white man s bible seems to mean not to give away anything important is that the existing bible is too polluted with jews what a briliantly racist revelation ! or is that revelation the only other major criticism is that the paper is too stiff to replace that sears catalog that s hanging in the outhouse 
useful method for controlling brainless drones oh dear this is another book like the horrible who moved my cheese that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children like the aforementioned who thinks my cheese stinks or whatever it is called i saw some people in the organisation where i work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days its all about making work fun yep work can be fun tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases of course it s just great fun to deal with children who have just had their parents killed or folks who just lost their kids because that s what work is fun or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers of course in the examples i have listed above it doesn t really work too well because this is really about getting people in perceived lower end occupations like factories or call centres to believe their mind numbing daily tasks can be funmyself i do have some fun at work but probably like many people with more than one brain cell it is based on having a laugh with my co workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us you can call this cynicism which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb fishstyle work must be fun philosophy i d call it black humour but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable as to the title of my review this method of making the workplace fun in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise first immerse people in the cult like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as funsecond let them know that they now choose their attitude if they are unhappy in any way regardless of them doing their work well or not they are letting the team down and not complying with the obligation to make work fun third while the majority of victims or workers however you choose to view your prey swallow the work is fun message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of fish you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not having fun at work and use the enron style message that they just don t get it in this way the resistant individual can be said to be incompatible with our mission and values bad for morale or just out of step in this way the funloving workers who have now taken on the costume of forced false fun can be set against them of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign this book is useful then if you wish to convince idiots that their work is fun just don t try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously they might tell you to stick your fish where the sun doesn t shine 
zoolander on the wagon interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring about half way through i had to quit it was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl will he call me did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me all i do is think about him is he thinking about me oh please please please let him say something to me i love you but i m not in love with you on and on the humor is mildly amusing but seems forced it doesn t ring quite true like the author is trying too hard an earlier negative reviewer said they didn t like the author it didn t prevent me from reading the book i like the writing of a number of unlikable people but i now understand the book is completely about this shallow person his struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting humane things about him his colleagues force him into rehab which turns his life around he returns to work a changed and invigorated man loving life but continues to mock the people who saved him it doesn t dawn on him to thank them 
it is so bad the absolute worst book eve 
not anne tyler s best i usually really like anne tyler and i do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real but not necessarily likeable but this was my least favorite book i ve read by her i could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made but she just seemed to lack depth in a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing to me the main character was difficult to identify with and i found her choices often disappointing i ve found anne tyler s other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me but i could still identify with them on some level there are many other anne tyler books that should be read before or instead of reading this one 
dissapointing ! mainly material from other books this is a great dissapointment from the respected author and the respedted publisher in the book there are sections of problems eight of them are problems from other books most of those books are themselves on theshelves collections of prbloms some of those books are really new one of them has not yet been published ! some other sections are problems from magazines there are many available books of interesing problems including this one fans of those book should be careful they may get mainly something they already have 
a fine line between being dead and being boring the author slips over this line once too often to rate the book above stars and that s in a fairly slim book just under pages the forward by backward by forward tale of this couple s ultimate day alive the details of a past that had them returning to this spot the nature of animals being their passion and study and their passion as animals being the authors study how time moves on and through all of us without paying much notice to us however the author spends a great deal of time examining their lives which really are practically unfulfilled and fairly dull lives to begin with in deep scientific detail what they had for breakfast what clothes they wore how much and how little they actually feel for one another at various moments throughout the day but no one ever really wakes up or comes to life so it comes to matter very little even to their daughter whether the couple is alive or dead

living to tell the tail by gabriel garcia marquez this is the weakest book mr marquez ever wrote a living proof that autobiographies written by the writers are sentimental drag his usual style of fantastic truth and romatic albeit very sad fantasy is nowhere to be found if you love marquez do not read this book 
weak lacking depth and dated material i ve read many books in this segment and i would strongly recommend reading hot text web writing that works or networds robert bly is a quotprint guy quot that thought it would be interesting to write a book on electronic copy i would say that the first half of the book is written by supposed experts in on line marketing the book is crowded with all sorts of references to other people s work this leads to a very choppy style of reading in my opinion the author uses case studies from work that he has already completed but rarely does the content match the electronic world for a book that is written in the data is incredibly dated the author is comfortable with using data from in a book that talks about the ever changing environment of on line marketing most of the data regarding internet statistics was incredibly dated the author talks about the principals of good copy writing but rarely goes into any depth with regards to examples of the principals i found the writing to be lazy to say the least clearly this author is capitalizing on the interest of electronic copy take out the experts that know about on line marketing you re left with an incredibly weak book although there are is a lot of expert reference rarely do the experts go into any depth with regards to their arguments or points if this book is the only book that you are exposed to within this segment you might be left thinking that you read an average book when you compare the book to other books in the same segment it simply doesn t compare not a good book 
ties that stress is it really that insightful although elkind does give some insights into the new post modern family he merely points out and reiterates the obvious elkind makes mention of the shift in familial focus from child centred to adult centred but all adults work and make schedule acommodations for their children daycares and afterschool cares are a neccessity because in order for parents to earn a livelihood to provide for their children they must be able to be in a surrounding in which they can do that this means they need to work and thus they find suitable care for their children while they are away elkind also makes mention of a vital family and how this is what people should be striving for again this seems quite obvious no parent wants to miss his her child s recital or sporting event no parent wants to have his her child growing up in an unstructured environment all of the qualities of the vital family that elkind describes is what most families are trying to achieve his insights here are not profound nor are they even innovative it is easy for an academic such as himself to stand back and critique society what is he doing to change these quotdeficienciesquot that he comments about as a sociologist elkind writes his book as if he is a historian dates and events are written in such a manner that appears to be fact while in essence he is simply making value judgements ties that stress is a book which gives a good outline on societal problems what it lacks in is an ability to instill in the reader a sense of activism after reading ties that stress i felt no sense of wanting to change the faults that elkind found instead i felt like i was being told what i was suppose to think because elkind deemed it so 
just plain dumb but that s to be expected since this is after all written for the sort of person who is somehow still behind the bush administration s foreign policy even after more than four years of it well this much can be said at least the author showed some consideration for his true audience by keeping things extremely short and simple simplistic in fact that audience is very easy to recognize theyre the ones while reading this book priced magazine article whose lips are moving 
did i miss something this book started off very good but as i read on the reading became ardious i found it hard work to finish this book i don t know why i had such a hard time enjoying the book while all the other reviewser thought it was the best thing since sliced bread but i would read another shark book such as shark trouble or close to shore rather than waste my time on this book 
this one did not work for me i think this book might be helpful for the professional interior decorator it was just not what i was looking for in a color book each section generally starts with a page or two of colors squares i e yellow or yellow orange it then describes the color a very s yellow warm and dense look at it with only the colors below and the three to the left these pages are then followed with photos of rooms using some of the colors the entire book is arranged this way the red rooms are almost completely red page and very few of the rooms were my particular taste or style some of the color palettes that were used together seemed more jarring than coordinated except when the author got to the more sedate calmer colors pg i prefer the bh g color schemes book which has a more realistic and useable color palette and presents them in beautifully decorated rooms again this one might be more useful to the professional decorator but for me it was too much text and history 
ho hum after a promising start the entire story moved along with such linear precision that it may have been written by a mathematician never did it deviate from a plotline that was anticipated after the second chapter in the genre of heist stories we ve come to expect twists and turns until the last minute here we had none i was waiting for somebody to be something other than what they appeared to be somebody to do something out of character and the thorough implausibility of the climactic confrontation on stage in front of people had me shaking my head oh and if somebody would be kind enough to post a follow up review explaining the significance of the hitch hiker i d appreciate it 
christian slop for the dumbed down i see some have given reviews that marrs researched his subject area well what he s done is give some conspiratorial reason for life as we know it he connects unrelated dots and makes so many egregious errors its not even worth mentioning because some guy makes some connections and offers cockamamie theories disguised as insight and knowledge doesn t make them true people i used to be a fundie christian but i could never quite understand how some supposed intelligent people could believe such utter toxic waste and even more so when less and less evidence produced the structure of a cult has it that you recruit the brainier types for some reason they are easier to bamboozle intellectual morons are what they re called in some circles i m not saying christians are intelligent from my experience quite the opposite but the leaders are but those who are intelligent are blind arrogant usually make massive conclusions based upon virtually nothing and fit the same pattern as the christians who destroyed ancient rome and brought on the dark ages what was rumor and innuendo usually stemming from paranoia and slop originating from the authors of books like the subject of this review ends up being cirulated and recirculated to the point that within these circles it becomes some nwo and luciferian reality scary ain t it then they cause wars to take place in far flung places like iraq so to bring about the death and chaos and so the messiah can ride down and impose his version of a dictatorship and meanwhile our good christians get to rule with a iron rod sounds like fantasy right not to these psychos because they are psychotic in their actions and the delivery system is christ insanity allow this mental toxic waste to propagate then you got another dark ages with added life destroying methods like bio warfare nuclear weapons and environmental degradation all for the arrival of the messiah anyway people this guy mr marrs repesents the same forces that destroyed european culture and achievement thus relagating her to backwater status for over years commencing with the dark ages where all knowledge and old ways were considered evil and heretical of the devil ! lucifer baal satan molech you get the drift i believe some beliefsystems are toxic waste waiting to destroy in the name of love and grace christ insanity is one such cult gone wild if it blossoms again be prepared for incessant wars to bring about the messiah and a earth destroyed for their paranoid and evil delusions they are the evil ones folks ! the greatest country as yet eventhough its tarnished now is probably the usa due to a farreaching and foresight oriented document called the constitution the men that brought it about were mostly freemasons and deists they didn t want the same petty religious squabbles that were happening in britian between various psychopathic christian factions to inundate the new america the puritans for example were persecuted by rival christian factions and when they obtained power became the persecutors i ve researched how the christians really acted in ancient rome they targetted higher ups rich wealthy senators to convert and then plotted and succeeded in controlling the roman state i e constantine they used basically the same tactics as early to modern communists scheming and doing everything possible to destroy the roman state so through a chaos scenario they can usurp it they did more than that then they destroyed all the vestiges of the old relgions banned all freedom of thought annihilated science philosophy and other disciplines europe didn t slink out of this until the renaissance meanwhile guys like marrs would say how the pope or some other religious leader was evil and of the devil and the cycle would endlessly repeat over and over and over until the madness abates with reason and open inquiry without the fear of being put in the iron maiden for heretical thoughts for example germany in the years war in the early s was turned into a wasteland of the population destroyed due to marrsesque madness folks there is a conspiracy mostly of very wealthy high level types who want to hold onto their shekels to the detriment of all basic human pettiness and greed is the most part they use democrazy and conflicting factions religious and ethnic divide and conquer to hold basic control and offer the illusion of voting bearing in mind the sleazebag politicians will do whatever gives them a new car or vacation and knowing selling out has become a virtue they these guys and politicians are criminals for the most part destroying the planet our health our very existence however because of their utter and complete corruption they will go down and no amount of bs democrazy is going to save their sorry asses when all their ill gotten wealth and property maybe even more is confiscated it is another cycle and it will happen sooner than you think so forget about numbnuts marrs and his drivel for the slow witted these a holes that i described will crash burn soon enough this is due to organic historical cycles and a shifting of wealth and power i can only hope a strong man comes about that makes them pay dearly for their arrogance and greed ruthless action is what will come my friends and when it does they won t have any place to hide 
disapointed i read the first several chapters of this book and found the author didn t have a grasp of the calvin s basic theological teachings which plainly contradicted some of bouwsma thoughts i do not question his historical expertise but i doubt very serriously that he knew john calvin in his book he called calvin a pagan and anybody who knows calvin knows he was a man of god he also took a passage from the institutes that calvin was addressing the catholic church and applied it to calvin to support his claim that calvin was anxious i tried three times to get something out of this book and failed all three times i appreciate calvin too much to keep this book in my library also i crossed referenced some of his notes he claimed he quoted calvin from and found discrepricancies if you want a secular oppion of who calvin was not based on his theological mindset then read this book otherwise disreguard it 
my first and last kinsey milhone debacle it s tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how bad it truly is but ms grafton has somehow earned a following and as i ve said before there is something for everyone out there after all some people not a majority actually voted for george w bush on purpose ! i think this level of mystery fluff is for them rather than spoil the nutty climax i have worked in hospitals for years so i ain t buying it i will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words life is one big savage joke not funny ha ha but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began i became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began where did they go to kindergarten that i almost missed the rest of the chapter 
enron cited often some good ideas on driving innovation but in hindsight some of the cited companies haven t passed muster if one tracks their long term business performance one of my favorite quotes from the book at enron failure even of the type that ends up on the front page of the wall street journal doesn t necessarily sink a career yeah right ! this kind of thinking puts one in jail 
only read half of it i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too i went to my local cofee place and got a medium regular cofee flavored cofee but in a large cup so theres room for plenty of milk which i like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large anyway i am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where i have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there so then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning and he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing anyway then he leaves and i notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as i thought previously so i m not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so i take it back to the library now here i have to point out that i had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that i returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever i go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when i turn the book in i explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the from the cofee house they made the cofee not me but you can guess how this ended up i am down another dollars and change i paid the cents in pennies i got from the place i keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since i counted them out one by one but it was worth it and i never finished the book since it was ruined but i liked the parts i read okay and if the president likes it i guess it gets four stars only i made it two stars because i only read half maybe i will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then i will come back and give this book it s missing two stars if it ends well lesson learned is life is not always fair but you keep on keepin on like they say 
if this is classic nature lit then maybe its just me i am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale and just say that i didn t enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned its boring and repetitive maybe its because i m not used to aimless albeit eloquent landscape descriptions or maybe it s the fact that nothing happens for pages but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience case in point casual readers beware 
for absolute beginners this book could easily have been called how to swap out modules in a computer monitor it is aimed at too low a level to be of any use to anyone seriously interested in troubleshooting a faulty monitor on their own whenever any serious troubleshooting is required the author simply says substitute a know working module yeah ! like we all have lots of them lying around if you ve got a faulty monitor and you dont know where to start looking for the problem you d be better off putting the cost of this book towards getting it repaired professionally just my opinion for what its worth 
great read if you ignore the last few pages on the surface john waters has it all a loving wife a beautiful child a successful business but appearances are deceiving his marriage is in trouble his business is under investigation by a federal agency and his business partner has made questionable financial decisions which jeopardize everyone s future into this mix wanders eve sumner a stunningly attractive woman who makes it abundantly obvious she s chosen waters as her next conquest however appearances are again deceiving because eve sumner claims she is actually mallory chandler waters first great love funny thing though mallory chandler died ten years previously so who is this woman and how does she know things only mallory should know in an effort to discover the truth waters finds himself involved in an affair that quickly turns dangerous as eve mallory displays the same obsessive behavior that destroyed waters love for mallory twenty years before this novel requires a major suspension of disbelief for its critical plot device transmigration of a soul once the reader accepts that however the story moves along quickly and works well within its preposterous premise waters flails and fumbles and does his best to fix the mess he s made by getting involved with eve mallory even as she seems to be setting him up for a murder charge his desperation and fear are palpable and certainly mitigate his at times wrong headed choices i truly enjoyed this story that is until i read the final pages the final plot twist which i won t reveal here is so farfetched even within the confines of a plot that stretches suspension of disbelief to its outermost limit as to spoil all the good trashiness that preceded it i read the last few pages and threw the book across the room i felt cheated i think mr iles wrote himself into a corner and couldn t think of any other way to give the reader a happy ending gah never have i been so disappointed with a novel s resolution oh and the frequent references to a novel written by a character within this novel which happens to have the same title as a novel written by iles bugged me too gahoh go ahead and read the story just rewrite the ending in your own head i did 
the literary equivalent of candy corn the success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people i was drawn to this book by it s title and central premise too bad ben sherwood can t write worth a lick im not sure which is more upsetting how poorly ben sherwood writes or how low our expectations have fallen as readers given the number of positive reviews this book has received 
wrong isbn the isbn number i ordered was the isbn i recieved is or both numbers are on the book 
totally debunked this book is in hindsight horribly wrong it is now known that there are no wmd s in iraq saddam did not pose a threat to america and the world at large it s just sad that the trumpeters of the iraqi war were playing to the wrong song it s packed with faulty and highly dubious intelligence the cia has since admitted as much but i do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a massive intelligence failure 
save your money i have not read this book either and do you know what i ve found that all the best book reviews at amazon are written by people who never read the books that they were reviewing ill tell you what can happen when someone gets a book into amazon they get all their mates to speed read their book and award it five stars and a glowing review when the poor suckers like you and me buy the book we find that it s just another re hash of the thousands of other money wasting books on investment and we ve been conned again imho these authors have no idea how to make money from investing if they did they would not be broadcasting their knowledge to the world they would either be using that information themselves or selling it to the king of saudi arabia or bill gates for millions of dollars so that he could make some serious profit from that knowledge ill tell you how to make money from investing buy a low cost index fund and hope that things go your way if you get lucky you ll make money if luck does not come your way then you won t but buying investment advice books will get you nowhere fast imho and waste the money you spend on the books if you want to learn about investing its all free on the internet so why buy books that are probably out of date when you get them anyway i reckon that writing investment books is a racket i ve got boxes full of them and i read the first few pages of most of them and never read any more wow have i wasted money on books like this no more ! joint my revolution and stop buying investment books 
some cowardly editor who said heylooks fine like it is before all the graham hancock fans out there get twerked off at me for the low star rating on this book hear me out go back and read my star fingerprints of the gods review and you will see that i consider hancock a genius of sorts the man is brilliant too brilliant but in fingerprints graham clearly latches on to einstiens theory of earth crust displacement as researched by charles hapgood but in underworld that seems blown by the wayside his work here and his conclusions seems like a book that someone who is writing a version of history that relegates fingerprints to the sidelines would write only problem is both books were written by the same man there is a really fascinating book within the pages of this mass patience warping accumulation of information hancock just over did it this time here is what i mean in fingerprints of the gods you can do a neat trick just pick up the book and open it to any section on any page and you can start reading and be totally fascinated by the subject fingerprints is that good almost every sentence is riveting underworld is at times as boring as a government information manual huge sections of information about hindu gods blah blahblahtoo much graham there are sections of underworld if you are willing to look for them that are just mind boggling in what they present and propose but you will have to approach the book as if it were a raw manuscript and you were a tireless editor perhaps hancock is a big and powerful man in publishing now and no one is willing stop and say hey graham lets just put half of this in the woodstove and heat the house for a few days ! hancock is one smart puppy no doubt and i suppose there is no crime in going through life knowing more than you need to but there is something that seems vaguely sadistic about making folks listen to everything you know or can find out about in fingerprints hancock seems at times impatient and indignant with the arrogance of the establishment and their often ludicrous assumptions and declarations yet in underworld there is a definite and distasteful undercurrent of hancock s own arrogance a side of him that is not complimentary to the theories and information he is trying to present drunks babble on in this manner a lot and intellectual drunks are the worse but if hancock was sober when he handed this megalithic manuscript in then perhaps it was some cowardly editor who in a drunken stupor said heylooks fine like it is ! 
fall fall charlotte susanna rowson s quotcharlotte temple quot is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman poor pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings quotcharlotte temple quot was written in and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now quotcharlotte temple quot has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary in the past twenty years feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati authors such as anne plumptre frances burney aphra behn sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries unfortunately rowson does not warrant such treatment rowson has a flat humorless approach to the fallen woman story unlike burney s quotevelinaquot or quotcamillaquot rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity her pedantic iron fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates in many of the fallen women stories authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man in england and america it was not considered altogether lady like to read a novel so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed rowson does not criticize men within the novel she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend s mistress he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting quotdishonorablequot against her yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her she would not have been reduced to a penniless pregnant ex mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte s downfall rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it instead rowson places the blame for charlotte s ruin on the women within the novel when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue madame du pont sets charlotte s downfall in action rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville charlotte quotelopementquot miss la rue the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville must be punished for being a promiscuous woman she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women why would modern readers want to read this i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel at pages it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace no character has any shadings there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte rowson does nothing to keep our interest unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best selling novel that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia but it does not make for engaging reading 
good fireplace book this is a great book to read by the fireplace after about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it in the fireplace ! this is the most boring disorganized pointless book i have ever read i read it because it was recommended by stephen king if you want a good book i would recommend looking elsewhere 
review of non existent product i was very disappointed to find that most of chapter genetic engineering was incomplete the chapter was cut off on page and was followed by a repetition of page chapter why we should worry had been left out and the beginning of chapter human rights page was missing as well it was very important for me to work on precisely these missing chapters at exactly this moment in time so i am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product 
wannabe mr davidar thought he was writing the great indian novel unfortunately what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort characterized by raj cliches prose that sounds like it is translated and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on india and indians which dont mesh with the main text at all i am glad i borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money though i did waste my time reading it all i can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained 
underwhelmed i too kicked myself for falling for the marketing hype that surrounds this mediocre book as others have noted the text is uneven hints a multiple authors and is based on little more than repetitions of various ideas from pop psychology and the current interest in law of attraction systems feel good platitudes abound but little else of any depth the book has unfortunately about the same level of subject depth as an average website on a related topic this book is an example of a very damaging trend in the publishing industry publishers can be wooed into printing a book entirely on the strength of the author s platform rather than any qualitative judgement of quality if you have a big enough mailing list and you can get a bunch of friends to write good amazon reviews see the early reviews of this book you can get a book published no matter how poorly written the bright side of this is that i now recognize the techniques used to activate this so called platform in the future i will not fall for it 
the cd doesn t run on a mac i wish i could review the book but i can t i have a mac and can t run the cd i have totally wasted my money almost every nursing book i ve bought in the last two years has had a cd and every one of them has worked i just went back through the description on amazon and can t find a reference to the fact that you have to be running windows so if you have a mac stay away from this book 
ppd is serious this book isn t this book is written entirely in bullet points and one page chapters consisting of more white space than text if it were subtitled positive affirmations rather than practical solutions i would not object but i would also not have been misled into buying it the author has an informative website that i would endorse and the content of the book is appropriate in that format it would make a good give away pamphlet to families in treatment as someone who truly is looking for practical solutions however i was disappointed that postpartum husband does not delve much deeper than be patient and supportive and despite the title the book gives surprisingly minimal attention to what a postpartum husband might do to take care of his own well being while patiently supporting his emotionally struggling wife and fulfilling all of his other family and work obligations the book promises more than it delivers which is unfortunate because there is a real need for advice directed to the practical minded husband 
don t waste your money the more i read of this book the more it seemed like a little mind trip of self indulgence for the author it s very difficult to take this book seriously when observing some of the comments the author makes for each book he rated there was a section called quotwhat i liked about this book quot and more than once his only comment in this section was quoteverythingquot while it s nice to see that he s truely writing about something he enjoys maybe the author should stick to something more modest such as a column in the local paper rather than such an ambitious undertaking as this while not truely awful the ambiguous format makes it painful reading 
great story but poor edition screen play heads up this is not a novel or book it is a small paperback stapled together screen play edition print is very small and difficult to read i do not recommend this edition even though it is a wonderful story and movie 
oh my god no i love music and i love making music but i don t read music or study it to me that would take all the fun out of it if you re like me you might dislike this book this book is huge excluding the appendices it s about large pages of instructions are you kidding me it says things like do this one particular thing for minutes then this for minutes etc i would never try to follow so many detailed lengthy instructions i like other oobe books i ve seen better maybe this is great for some people but i need something easier and more to the point 
this book was bad i don t know what kluver and powers were thinking but it was obvious that they have never even visited china or spent any time around real chinese people if they have been to china it only shows that they are totally ignorant of the topic at hand this book is another in a long line by small minded western biased anglo loving nerds in addition to that there were numerous typos and errors in the book too many to begin to list here but page contained one of the biggest blunders i have ever seen unless a professor forces you to buy this book stay far far away from it because you can learn more about this topic on mtv than in this book 
almost boring i just finished reading the book there is nothing in it about velocity it s boring predictable and has lots of filler text 
boring textbook i had to buy this book for a class it is an extremely boring read and i struggle to keep myself awake while reading it as does the rest of the class i am told it does tell you about dreamweaver though and i suppose that is its purpose one thing that i do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing internet explorer and other isp s his personal opinions are a real turn off and unnecessary 
i am so sorry i am so sorry i read this book under the illusion it was a mystery type of book the author has been writing on the edge of fictional biography mystery and this time she crossed the line i got bewildered when the plot never turned up the bad guys were just so unimportant that the twins linguistic skills just overrode their appearance on the scene and peabody s maternal instincts just couldn t be bothered with evil doers the book is probably fine for those who bought the author s work for reading about the sentimental family interrelations but for those who expected something more exciting it is a dissapointment i feel as if i was sold this book on false pretenses 
mel levine is an idiot i found this book to be insulting to children and to educators this man obviously has no idea what he is talking about his ideas are strictly from the deficiency model of student underachievement which has been shown to be a faulty method of explanantion any educator who reads this book and takes it seriously should be relieved of their jobs asap in addition his physical descriptions of his patients are bordering on perverted 
baking recipes are a disaster have the people who ve written such rave reviews of this book actually attempted any of the baking recipes my second attempt was as bad as the first and according to one of the online forums i found i m not the only one who s had trouble i like the ideas behind many of the book s suggestions but putting them into practice made for very flawed results the banana bread overflowed the pan and over browned on the top without ever cooking through the breakfast pastries were so wet even after adding more and more flour that rolling them was a joke then they just dissolved into very flat cookies but considering the recipe didn t call for any rising agent what else could be expected it s like whoever wrote these recipes never even tested them 
the innocents abroad live talk about a typically clueless american i threw this book away after reading about half in exasperation 
p os tipler says many times as i have proved huh what the f is he talking about there is no proof in this stinking pile of filth he s got an abundance of physics in the back of the book id like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense but i don t think it should matter i am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts and tipler just doesn t make any sense his writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time the more books you read the sooner you know when to stop reading put the book down and read a work of fiction instead which can play with such ideas without boring you to death 
horrible war books are not my favorite but even so this book sucked i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this from the moment my prof assigned it i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was ! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it 
no no no too many errors and misinformation masquerading as a text on correctly using infrared i found this book very poorly written loaded with errors and containing amatuerish photographs i felt ripped off i will look for better written books on the subject if i could have looked the book over ahead of time i never would have purchased it 
historically inaccurate garbage this book gets one star because you can t give zero i have a b a in european history and i am utterly horrified by the historical inaccuracies in this series as examples taken at random there are lots lots more of them in book one bauer describes alcibiades as betraying athens and leading an army into the city utterly incorrect she admits she moved boudicca s revolt until a later date in order to show that the roman empire was breaking down hello you can t move historic dates in order to prove a hypothesis in book two in her description of justinian s rise to emperor she basically says that he left the farm studied hard and was chosen emperor in point of fact his uncle was emperor her historical errors go on and on the author evidently didn t even bother to check her facts against something as simple as wikipedia bauer according to her cover blurb is a novelist and journalist with no apparent academic training in history and boy does that lack of academic training show she writes appealing journalistic hyperbole but doesn t bother to back her breezy simplifications with historical facts bauer also has a strong religous agenda i m a christian myself but find the presentation of bible stories as historical events offensive anyone using this book to teach history to their child is doing their child a vast disservice 
wise blood i had to force myself to finish this book after reading two thirds i felt compelled to finish it simply in hopes of finding some redeeming value to the time i d already invested upon finishing the book unlike the insightful and eloquent analysis by the reader in new england i shut the book and said quotthis is the stupidest book i have ever read quot after calming down a little i began to wonder if perhaps wise blood represented flannery s life and emotions one has to imagine being stricken with a debilitating disease that eventually robbed her of life at a young age must have tortured her to some degree she must have wondered where is god in all this without being able to deny him could hazel represent flannery a life of seeming despair allowed to waist away slowly in a drainage ditch only to be finally found yet treated with complete disregard and with utter contempt by the police sent to rescue and redeem haze flannery by thumping him her on the head with a death blow without any apparent feelings was flannery making a statement about being treated thus by god is it possible flannery used wise blood as a cathartic for her own emotions towards god for the cards she d been dealt i don t say that judgmentally in the least it just makes sense now that i am calm enough to think about it i m hardly qualified to dish out such psycho babble basically i still agree with the new england reader in terms of regretting the read perhaps this story will have more meaning should i face personal suffering and loss like flannery faith does not make one immune to the multi levels of agony this story was agonizing 
annoying the author s failed attempt to be cute and clever is very annoying i guess he wanted to follow the style of hofstadter paulos berlinski and others the problem is he s just not a good writer 
don t waste your time fontane s examination of upper class germany in the nineteenth century ultimately proves to be a scathing indictment of the quotme first quot mentality but and this is important nothing happens for about pages fontane wastes the readers time by doing what could be done in about pages he shows how messed up the whole aristocratic scene was yeah so they commit adultery an lie to each others face you don t have to drag it out for so damn long all in all it makes me feel good to not be a rich upper class waster and once the hammer drops about pages before the book ends it still doesn t matter that fontane has built these characters up they are all the same exact characters in different bodies i didn t feel anything for effi or instetten or anyone else except roswitha and her only because her dad chased her aroudn with a red hot poker when she was a young girl 
fictional thoughts of a lunatic the book is poorly written full of fictional rantings and generally liberal recapping of other historial history books the author rants like a lunatic and how this book was ever published is a mystery to me 
dull and plotless while comedian al franken is normally quite humorous this novel was a bit dull there s very little plot and after awhile every page seems like the one before it sure there s the occasional funny part but overall this book is not worth reading quite frankly it s just stupid if it didn t have al s name on the cover it is very doubtful anyone would pick this up if you re looking for something humorous read the idiot girl s guide to action and adventure or the bear went over the mountain 
betty s not what she used to be time was when the words betty crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks although the books recipes for better or for worse were always a product of their times the very first betty crocker picture cook book was published in still available revolutionized how cookbooks were produced and was an enormous best seller the recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company s kitchens and in homes across america this was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages this gradually changed as betty and her books became more and more of a shill for general mills products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company s bottom line but to the detriment of good cooking the two all purpose cookbooks that came out in and were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips helps although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience especially in the edition but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes if you have one of these books treasure and keep it you ll never see their likes again the current th edition looks good but like the past several editions the number of recipes has been drastically reduced gone are the many variations which are especially missed in baked goods it was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from now way too many recipes are of the dump and stir method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results also gone is the very friendly assuring conversationial voice of yesteryear yes there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles but they are mostly stripped down versions its obvious that the folks at betty crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can t be bothered with proper preparation of dishes which begs the question of why general mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore the better homes and gardens new cookbook is a better bet for those looking for an all purpose everyday guide it has a better layout the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality and there are more recipes and variations than betty crocker s had in some time even better if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family i highly recommend the cookbooks of cooks illustrated americas test kitchen their comparable general purpose cookbook is called the america s test kitchen family cookbook the recipes are tested and reworked dozens of times if necessary to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them it s a shame that betty crocker has abdicated her throne and good name but there s even better stuff out there now go for it ! 
can we give stars after seeing ted nearly amputate his own leg on tv while cutting down a sapling that a boy scout could ve cut down with a gerber camp axe i have decided to dismiss teddie as a bombastic nutjob who will in the end be a caustic detriment to the true culture of sportsmen in america oh god no ! i m starting to sound like him now ! the near amputation actually was the beginning of the slide for me reading his article in american hunter of dec and then re reading this book actually sealed the deal ted is not the epitome of true sportsmen ! it was bad enough watching kerry drag around geese that had been dead for a week during election time to try to gain the duck s unlimited vote but watching ted do anything in the name of modern sportsmen is just as bad how can ted s actions help our image there s an old saying in the south an empty can rattles the most holds true for ted 
pretentious text weird typography if you want to read a presuppositionalist defense of militantly unregenerate calvinism i d suggest every thought captive by richard pratt instead it s much clearer it s written in far better english it s unpretentious and it will take up a lot less of your time the text of this book looks as though it was photographed from a cut andpaste of miscellaneous typescripts of different text sizes the typographical variations appear to have no function just another irritation in a pretentious and windy book 
waste of time the heart is a lonely hunter is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together if you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life you might enjoy this book the charcters are indeed animated however if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot this book is not for you by the time i was half way through the book i was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop one never materialized this book does not adhere to the standard beginning middleend protagonist antagonistplotresolution formula by which most novels abide as i was reading this book as a book club assignment i trudged through to its completion now all i wish is that i could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages 
i don t get it it s tm for golfers with a scotish accent can t believe this book has a following 
beware of this substandard effort if you re a ludlum fan like i am you will be acutely disappointed in this bomb after the likes of the sigma protocol and the janson directive this one is about as interesting as watching the tide come in it starts with a hackneyed premise of terrorist weapon materials being transported to china then comes to a grinding halt as the story stagnates for hundreds of pages going on and on with no advancement of the plot whatsoever like a car stuck in the mud 
buyer beware this is the only book i have ever given a bad rating this book not only has useless information on the occult but has a negative and unappealing tone throughout the reading although i can agree to disagree with some of the thing he states about the charasmatic movement this book is poorly organized and is a hard real buyer beware 
not much help don t waste your money on this one it was recommended by rich dad advisors but doesn t tell you how to get going and unless you live in or want to travel to one of the lien states there s nothing in for you the other states are not mentioned 
not what i expected i ordered this for a friend thinking it was the same bruce fisher book i bought when i divorced it is only the workbook and really needs a workshop or maybe just a book to go with it it was a total waste of money and not what i expected when i ordered make sure you are ordering the book not the workbook when you order 
man what tough going what a slog it is trying to get through this book i m nearly there ive read or other books since starting this the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends and the mostly rave reviews it s got here ignatius reilly the main character is interesting enough thats why i gave it instead of star but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring i find myself flicking on the pages to see how far i have to go before the story gets back to ignatius again i keep thinking ok the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the pulitzer prize i m at a loss to explain its popularity 
o k interesting to see about the actual people who were involved in the harlem renaissance but the author uses so many names that it gets confusing 
lemony turns sour i don t know about anyone else but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series this is the most boring one of them all in my opinion and well how many times can the same story be told bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children children figure it out but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything even when it s pointed out to them times 
historically significant but that s about it i gave this book stars because it is historically significant to understand the thinking of the gender feminists of the s i also found the discussion of the equality feminists from the s to be interesting the right to vote for women was of course important as were several other causes that the equality feminists fought for i rated this book low because the author attempts to explain the housewife phenomenon but ends up overgeneralizing and trying to speak for all women the author is very snobby and self rightous thinking she is able to determine which women are really fulfilled and living their life to it s fullest potential the ideas in this book are what caused people like my mother to talk negatively about dumb housewives and to eat their words when their own children such as myself grew up and became housewives or what we now call stay at home moms which i might add was mostly fueled by watching my workaholic mother who i do love very much who didn t seem to enjoy anything in life except work fortunately we can teach our biased and prejudiced mothers that some women really do get fulfillment from raising their own children homesi am only going to touch on some of the ridiculous arguments in this book because there are too many to list ms friedan gives evidence that children in other s care actually turn out better than those raised by their mothers great so she was teaching a generation of women that they are better off working than caring for their own children that other people can do a better job than they can what a vote of confidence the author goes on and on about how mothers were smothering their children and this is why many turned to a life of the feminine mystique sorry but a s mom with children and a lack of modern conveniences did not have time to smother her children basic care for as many children as women had in the s would consume most of a mother s time if you want to see parents who overwhelm their children with attention and material goods and live vicariously thru them look around in according to the research and i use this term lightly because someone as depressed as ms friedan must have had trouble seeing the happiness in others in this book you are either working mother mentally stable able to do household tasks in lightning speed and raise completely competent children educated housewife most likely on drugs and or are alcoholic are so depressed you contemplate suicide have dysfunctional children and a husband who is trying to get away from your sexual advances uneducated housewife content with life because you are a complete idiot ms friedan completely ignores that there were and there still are a significant percentage of women who want to be at home caring for their families and homes i m sure there were millions of women who were benefitted by being emancipated from their homes that is good that they were happier with more choices however ms friedan should have encouraged them to do this without dragging millions of other women thru the mud with her chapter on the sexual sell i m glad that she figured out people make money thru advertising by manipulating people advertisers manipulate everyone not just women and i am sure the thingbuying housewife of the s was nothing like the guilt ridden working or stay at home mom today who s child has so many toys he she doesn t know what to do except claim im bored due to being so overwhelmed p ms friedan quotes someone who says to make one half the human race consume its energies in the functions of housekeeper wife and mother is a monstrous waste of the most precious material god ever made the fact that ms friedan would even give credit to this comment by citing it in her book speaks volumes about her mentality when i thought the ideas in this book couldn t get any more rediculous ms friedan started talking about homosexuality the feminine mystique is driving men to be gay ! men are so repulsed by their over controlling wives and mothers that they are turning against women and turning homosexual ! also ms friedan thinks housewives are sex crazed zombies in search of any man and finally this comment i am convinced there is something about the housewife state itself that is dangerous in a sense that is not as far fetched as it sounds the women who adjust as housewives who grow up wanting to be just a housewife are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camp is this woman serious this stuff is so warped i can hardly put it into words ! it is my opinion that this author was extremely depressed and or had psychological problems was insanely jealous of happy wives mothers 
i thought it was a dream i kept waiting for stephanie to wake up and realize that it was all a dream but she didn t what shocked me even more was when i went on to read the th book and some of the story from visions fo sugarplums carried over i was already getting a little tired of the far fetched sp stories but this one went too far if i could give it stars i would 
the power of your subconscious mind abridged cd the book is amazing ! the cd is horrible ! stick to reading the book yourself i have over audio books and this was like listen to a bad commercial i had to turn it off there is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading they don t even state who the narrator is i recommend the book to anyone the content is life changing 
the witch s tongue the charlie moon series is getting more amusing and more spiritual for lack of a better word as it evolves certainly moon has become a more interesting character he was always more interesting than the earlier protaganist in the series scott parris i enjoy the series but it is not my favorite reading i find hiding of clues and information from the reader irritating 
underwater close encounter of the boring kind this thriller focuses on norman johnson a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes as the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the us navy johnson learns that the crash site is located feet under the south pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft he was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration an assignment that johnson would just as soon forget once the team is taken to the navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances that the navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology labels and directions are even written in english leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is the suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile this novel is quite predictable just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby that the undersea environment will become threatening there will be many deaths there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on while there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment crichton is capable of so much more if you are a fan read it but be forewarned if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this 
bummer subject to be writing about no one alive today cares that ny had fires in unlike the chicago fire of why did author lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident is she trying to create trouble be a traitor to her own race book is well researched i guessbut the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up ! totally unnecessary ! 
whinniest author ever oh my god if you ve ever wanted to read a book written by someone who is ungrateful and whines and thinks they are better than everyone else this is your book this book is so long and drawn out and has no point the author had absolutely no reason to write this book other than to vent their ungratefulness on the rest of us it breaks down like this polish family flees to canada to escape the nazis they start out rough but end up doing quite well where s the story the author goes on and on and on about how boring things are and describes her self superiority over everyone else with paragraph after paragraph of just boring descriptions it s no fun to read she had it very well growing up in canada her family was safe and ended up making a good living there what s the problem the author has an attitude problem rather than try to make do in her new envrironment she just whines and whines about it constantly at least her little sister tries to blend in this one just cries about it and seems to think she can see more or understand more than everyone else around her news flash ya can t you are just like everyone else honey you should be grateful for all your parents did for you instead of fighting it every step of the way dont read this book it s boring 
how bad can you get with good ideas of the first three anita blake s novels this is surely the worst this hit me as totally unexpected and i am very disappointed the problem lies in the plot misconstructed discontinuous a heap of unrelated events thrown together with little sense not to mention a mass of inconsistencies spread throughout the pages inconsistencies in characters descriptions and details are to be found in all the first four books but here we have mistakes such as anita driving her car which was wrecked the night before and is again the day after hard to swallow in such a context that some ideas are really good and some characters very interesting matters very little 
not even close to others in series for those of you reading the entire series of in death books this is a real disappointment i m wondering if someone else wrote it there is no candy bar thief peabody mcnab development insights into eve s past just nothing ! yes mavis having the baby is progress but that could have been done in pages please nora spend a little more time with the characters in the next book or if you are tired of them wrap it up this one is a real stinker 
low fat low sodium low sugar this book still have the magic and mysticism of a distant planet but is rather insipid and simplistic very low reading 
whoppers more or less unsubstantiated in gold warriors by sterling and peggy seagrave claim that materials seized by the japanese military from across asia between and have been used to finance a range of ethically and morally questionable political activities with the united states government acting as the leader of this cabal these valuables range from cultural items through intellectual property industrial materials and equipment and precious and semi precious gemstones to massive quantities of gold and other metals the seagraves claim that much of the materials seized between and were secreted at sites in the philippines this country being used as the transit station the authors go on to state that much of this treasure trove has been recovered by a loosely linked collection of groups including the us japanese and phillipino governments various crime cartels and treasure hunters in the case of the us governemnt this wealth was used to finance anti communist and or right wing agenda groups when i considered how to rate this book i was conflicted as fiction it is clearly worth a five star rating as non fiction that is to say the truth i have to give it two stars and that s generous the problem is lack of documentation for many of the claims now before the seagraves or you say check the cds the authors tell you repeatedly of the wealth of information that is on three cds you can get from them sort of like the hunt for the gold and other valuables in this story the wealth is there surely you must beleive me i have to say i purchased this book on the assumption the story would be told with backing documentation attached documentation is few and far between this work some other critques have cited mis spellings of place names and technical inaccuracies related to volumes of gold in the world to them i want to add battery crockett on corregidor cited as a location where looted gold was hidden in the remains of a power room hit by a japanese shell was neither a mortar battery nor was it damaged by a major explosion caused by the japanese bombardment the explosion happened at battery geary in addition the site of post theater where a small quantity of gold was hidden in a bomb crater that a treasure hunter was able to locate because he was able to find two aerial photos of the site that were taken minutes apart with one showing the crater and the second showing the crater having been filled is also mis identified as to location on corregidor for those who care the post theater was on middleside close to the major set of enlisted barracks not on topside near macarthur s so called headquarters and the milelong barracks in fact while the post headquarters was at topside macarthur s hq was in manila until he evacuated the city then it was in malinta tunnel well below the surface of the island in fact it was his using the tunnel that resulted the troops calling him dugout doug all this simply builds the case for not just shoddy research but a questionable truth about what is being said as a whole as i have not seen the cds btw i don t intend to pursue getting them i don t know if they contain information that may provide proof for many of the statements contained in this book you see if they don t we are compelled to believe second and third hand accounts of what deceased and or unidentified individuals have claimed or at least it is a statement that the authors claim was made my concern is that validity is not automatically granted by placing a statement in quotations an activity that occurs frequently in this book it is in that aspect that this book falls into what i call heresay history a circumatnce where the opinions of an author or authors are presented as documented evidence in fact as i think about this story which i m sure contains any number of truths like japanese looting and hiidng of valuables and killing of pows my overall impression is gold warriors great similarity with other questionably documented stories such as roswell the philadelphia experiment the montauk project or project phoenix the kennedy assasination conspiracies etc etc etc but it is a heck of an entertaining read on a long airplave flight 
overdone this book is unfortunately as tedious as the last book in this series the plot and cast of characters are a bit more real than last go round the only reason for the two stars in my opinion there are way too many tedious details repeated and gone over way too many times did i mention that it was tedious again the final moments are quickly rushed through and please we would like to know what happens when the last bad vampire is gone ! we spend way too much time with our hero and heroine and then the scene just peters out and makes us wonder what happened next although quite frankly i really don t care that much about them i just invested my time and would like some closure i keep hoping that ms drake will improve but i m not holding my breath waiting until the next release 
good fireplace book this is a great book to read by the fireplace after about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it in the fireplace ! this is the most boring disorganized pointless book i have ever read i read it because it was recommended by stephen king if you want a good book i would recommend looking elsewhere 
she made it even harder to get by ehrenreich is the kind of journalist i despise one who thinks her insights are so important that it doesn t matter how much she inconveniences others to make her point she constantly drones about how difficult it is to find housing on the wages blue color workers earn the market is to tight that oftentimes one has to use a huge percentage of one s pay to stay in hotels while looking for apartments does that stop ehrenreich from competing for those coveted apartments of course not she has to do her research and she is the only reliable subject she can find to satisfy her curiousity if jobs and apartments are so hard to come by then leave those jobs and digs for the people who so desparately need them there is nothing one learns from ehrenreich s experiences that one couldn t have learned from professional interviews of blue color workers but that would have taken away ehrenreich s righteous indignation dont encourage this kind of writing see it for what it is gratuitous research that could have been easily conducted without firsthand experience and that while doing it some very needy people were out of work and living in substandard housing conditions 
no longer standard ! do not use this dreadful anthology was once the standard english edition of plato i had to assign it when i taught courses on plato because there was nothing else many of the translations are bad even the decent ones often are quite old and their flowery victorian diction is off putting the collection isn t complete as it leaves out a number of important dialogues from the platonic corpus and the introductions are uniformly ghastly the editors have little understnding of philosophy and keep saying horrible things like quottheres a lot of boring logic chopping in this dialogue but at least the personality of socrates is engaging quot there is no longer any need to be subject to the tyranny of hamilton amp cairns ! there is now a far better edition with excellent introductions excellent translations and including all the dialogues it s the complete works from hackett pub edited by john cooper it will be the standard edition from now on go get that one ! don t get this one 
read it in one night this book is really for those who are in the beginning stages of thinking about getting into mystery shopping and covers the barest of basics it does include the information for many companies so that one can immediately start filling out applications but all this information can be found on the mspa and when i purchased this book i bought it in the hopes that it would be more of an actual manual i was looking for guidance about the verbiage that companies want used in their reports if that is also what you are looking for pass on this book as it does not really address this much needed information it also appears by the number of pages that the book is loaded with information but the font is so big that the number of pages is very deceiving roughly pages of this book would equal page in a regular book not to slam the book it is a good read for someone thinking about getting into mystery shopping but not for anyone that s done any mystery shopping already 
not well written i have read hundreds of paranormal romances and this one just does not have it at all besides the numerous spelling errors the story line is trite the character development weak and the conversation inane and unbelieveable the idea isn t bad but the story development is amaturish and the contact between the two is like child and mentor rather than lover none of the love scenes were believeable in even a remote manner they seem to have been taken from other stories so therefore lacked power it cost way too much for the lack of worthy story if you want to give offen a try borrow the book from someone or the library don t waste your money i purchased this and the second in the series which i am not going to read i ll give it to the half price book store and let someone else suffer through the stories 
how to coach tee ball with out going insane this book is a good book for older kids playing tee ball i am coaching a ymca league comprised of and year olds if you are coaching little guys gals i would recommend videos more than books 
poorly written i am very disappointed in this book after reading only the first couple of chapters the poor editing and grade school sentence structure becomes exceptionally annoying by the time the author has described the branches or denominations of heathenry they sound so unpleasant as to actually turn one off to the faith altogether this coupled with the rambling tone lead me to feel that this book has no direction and is mostly opinion disguised as authority if the author actually lives up to their assertion that they are in fact clergy one would assume they could at least write a decent sentence if you are new to the subject go google the topic you ll learn more and the writing is better 
the grunting pig having read much of ann coulter s book godless i was impressed with her energy but dismayed by her hyperbole her basic themes about the godlessness of american liberals are right on target but she unfortunately goes way over the top in some of her examples and analogies therefore i thought it would be interesting to check out one or more of the response books engendered by her bombshell being in a bookstore i picked up brainless to see if the liberals had any good response to coulter s assertions sadly the author of this book named it after himself as he is clueless about how to go about writing an effective rebuttal the entire book is one long series of ranting ad hominem attacks that resemble the gruntings of a pig maguire starts out by indicating that if you are part of less that of the american population who is white male conservative and therefore bigoted you probably wont want to read his book it goes downhill from there maguires unwitting accomplishment is that he has proved coulter right in his case liberals are completely clueless 
jaquita price ms scott th the book teacup full of roses had a few topics that teens today could relate to nevertheless this was not a very enjoyable book to me i didn t like it because of how short it was i think it should have been longer to give more details in my opinion the prolouge didn t fit well with the ending of the book overall i give the book a on a scale of to i would not reccomend this book to anyone because it was lacking a few things which made it confusing 
paint shop pro power not this book really needs a glossary the author assumes too much including that the reader has psp s manual one does not if the program is bought online and downloaded one cannot start a project in this book if you do not know where to begin i have been using psp for two years and recently got psp and this book has given me very little help look for something that at least has a solid overview or foundation it does not have to be intro to 
a testament to the author s ego and pettiness as michael rubin said losing iraq illustrates what went wrong with planning for post liberation iraq although not for the reasons its author a council on foreign relations staffer intends in the run up to the iraq war the state department hired phillips to moderate seminar discussions among iraqis he uses this limited experience to conclude that the cause for difficulty in post liberation iraq was not lack of planning but rather a failure to listen how could such noble intentions iraqs freedom go so wrong he asks the white house and pentagon political appointees thought they could liberate a county without talking to those they were liberating he replies phillips appears unaware that every iraqi who met with him also visited the pentagon national security council and central intelligence agency u s officials would meet almost daily at the national security council chaired by officials such as zalmay khalilzad then the president s special assistant for iraq and stephen hadley then deputy national security advisor rather than researching and analyzing prewar planning losing iraq becomes a testament to the author s ego and pettiness features that caused iraqis and u s officials alike to push phillips aside he describes kanan makiya with whom he clashed on issues including de baathification as poisoned by neoconservatives who transformed him from an academic to a polemicist most iraqis and americans differed and questioned whether phillips s hostility was due to jealousy of makiya s prominence in fields in which phillips sought to compete phillips also writes that he initiated ideas like a kirkuk commission to adjudicate competing property claims but was ignored actually such a commission was up and running weeks before his epiphany phillips revises events liberally saying for example that he and ryan crocker deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs opposed the establishment of the coalition provisional authority because it did not empower iraqis actually crocker opposed the transfer of sovereignty the irony of phillips s argument is hubris he chides bush administration officials for not listening to iraqis but he himself did not bother to travel to baghdad in the wake of iraq s liberation rather as revealed in a wall street journal review by rob pollock he lifted descriptions from newspapers his experience in iraq was limited to a few brief trips to iraqi kurdistan before the war the sheltered guest of a kurdish politician losing iraq may try to castigate the white house but instead becomes an example of the arrogance about which so many iraqis complain phillips treats iraq as a template upon which to lay down his theories the iraqi voice is subsumed to his own if the white house really lost iraq the success of the iraqi elections suggests otherwise it was because it subordinated the voice of iraqis to outside advisors like phillips more interested in pumping up their own importance than in the welfare of iraq may 
prosy or clunky and not as faithful as it might be first it ought to said that as poetry in english this translation of rimbaud fails utterly mason indicates in the introduction that he attempts to walk the line between literal and poetic translation if by this he means that he neither resorts to the kind of inanity with which paul schmidt destroyed rimbaud for late th century americans nor to the faithful but poetically unsatisfying fowlie edition then he s telling at least a version of the truth but who could not with fluent french and enough time translate french works faithfully into prose and yet because he is comparatively a novice writer in english of the analogous sort of poetry to that which rimbaud wrote in french the concessions and compromises he must make are just terrible as regards both the literal and technical aspects of the poems concerning the early verse poems it becomes quickly clear that the translator has no skill as a versifier translating requires a resourcefulness bred of technical experience i don t know if mason writes original poems but if so they must be of a very modern sort which is to say contemporary as opposed to modernist free verse of course few people now have good ears for versification but to those who do to those who wish a translation to convey something of the greatness at least of the original the technical performance sounds woefully like that of a beginner his rhymes are forced his syntax is wrenched for rhymes that aren t particularly good in the first place and his meter is extremely slack if it exists at all this is particularly a problem as the greatness of rimbaud s someodd early poems derives in large part from his technical genius to take at random only one of many examples in his translation of les corbeaux mason translates what in english means roughly strange army with your harsh cries cold winds are ravaging your nests as strange armies with cries that crack cold nests that winds attack this contains the sort of forcing of rhymes that an adept poet would know to avoid mason has added highly unnatural demonstrative pronouns to these two very short phrases in order to get a rhyme whose first element crack is way off the result is an ugly fragment of course crows cries might be described as cracking but not in this poem the same translation ends with alas which is no where in the original and is again inserted for rhyme s sake falling as it does at the end of the last line it makes the poem sound glib and world weary in french the poem is certainly not glib and not exactly world weary in the way that alas as the poem s final word makes it sound i could go on for a page with problems i find in just this one poem the text is filled filledwith such clunkiness and it makes for bad poetry and bad translation of meaning if mason were a good resourceful poetic translator he would not be quite so baffled by the formal constraints perhaps he should have rendered a prose translation surely he should have worked harder at it but i guess few are the people who know how to translate poems and even fewer are those who can spy a bad translation 
sloppy by and large some chapters the basic spring are ok even good many advanced topics are covered in a sloppy manner further the editing is generally bad i must say that i have read a finely edited book by manning namely hibernate in action 
overview but too many small errors i looked for an introduction to the basics of office automation and bought this book every example code i tried was incorrect and the examples are just all trivial samples from the msdn was just as good as this book if you only need a rough overview what technologies are out there this book is ok but for any real programming it is not very useful 
terrible book oh my all the terrible reviews for this book are true ms steel is excessively repetitive i mean excessive ms steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over you get the picture i too found myself saying okay we get it already i also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had i don t know the men ms steel knows and hangs out with but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them oh please no man on earth talks that way especially to other men this book is completely aweful the plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention i have read many of ms steel s books and i believe this one is her worst i have now started reading sandra brown and she is sooo much better i recommend the alibi so far that has been my favorite by her she has mystery suspense romance her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than ms steels to sum it up i was completely disappointed with the book toxic bachelors i highly recommend sandra brown she is a much better author

ok if you can t be bothered to search although much of the information contained in this book is available through other sources wwwoneweddingcouk for example it is likely to be useful for someone in the beginning stages of planning their wedding and reception 
slow this book for the lack of a better word was cheesy i read my first danielle steel book a few weeks ago malice and was really impressed i decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well this book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever on top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that i couldn t stand even reading about him this book was bad and extremely predictable big dissapointment 
haven t read the book just the reviews one year it s eat every hours the next year it s eat every to hours i will try taking antioxidants before i go walking in the morning frankly i get so sick of all this diet stuff everyone wants to get rich on their brilliant ideas the elephant in the room is eat less exercise more period if that doesn t work eat even less exercise even more sorry i m not going to waste any more money on diet books 
a disappointment well below expectations perhaps my expectations were too high martha produces a beautiful magazine and her new best of weddings book is superb so i thought that this book although older would be a nice addition i was disappointed although the book was published in it seemed even more outdated than that the flowers used seemed repeated over and over again and the book was centered completely around the varieties in martha s garden for a more thorough view i d like to recommend books in place of this one jane packer s fast flower arranging is fantastic and shows beautiful arrangements that can be made quickly even by a novice for actual technical quothow to quot steps and design theory i d recommend judith blacklock s quotflower arranging quot might be called teach yourself flower arranging in some indexes once you know proper floral design techniques you can use any kind of flowers not just those from martha s garden to create beautiful arrangements 
not krentz s best i usually really enjoy jayne ann krentz and her alter ego amanda quick but i actually returned this one to the library unfinished i found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
completely pointless as a long time and avid knitter i m thrilled with the upswing in the popularity of the craft with that comes both the brilliant and the boring this book falls under the latter category it s a basic history of knitting with pop culture references thrown in if you have access to the internet then you have most of the pop culture portion at your fingertips if you are looking for a history of knitting i would stick with no idle hands by anne macdonald if you want wit and humor save your for one of stephanie pearl mcphees books 
this is hard to write but not as hard to read as this book i ordered this and the favorite game taking advantage of amazons buy two and get a deal policy i didn t like this book at all it doesn t feel as natural as favorite game it doesn t flow like fg and doesn t delieve like fg i don t know what mister cohen was trying to accomplish james joyce or henry miller lost generation of montreal the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one is solely on my adoration of the author 
disappointing most of the recipes not at all simple as claimed in the subtitle i know hors d oeuvres are frequently finiky and labor intensive but i wanted to believe the claim of simplicity made on the cover it ain t so just made the recipe for quotanchoiade dip with crudites quot which winds up the consistency of a vinaigrette i suppose you could use it as a dip if you want it dripped all over the carpet it s a good dressing but to present it as a dip is silly also this particular recipe is careless it calls for quot ounces tins anchovy fillets quot the tins of anchovies i buy are ounces net doubling or not an ingredient in a small recipe is not trivial especially if it s anchovies the recipe for quotcuminspiced carrots quot was a disappointment too the flavors involved didn t seem to amount to much my reaction is this is another pot boiler compendium of other peoples recipes untested by the editor 
completely outdated i purchased this book in october and even though i was a total beginner i quickly realized that it is completely out of date do not buy this book today this book was published in october and web programming and publishing programs have evolved so much since that there is barely anything relevant in this book anymore after some further research i decided that the best way for me to build my website was to learn one of the html visual editor programs and i purchased a recent book on dreamweavermx which has all i need 
a mediocre look at french style i bought this book expecting it to be as wonderful as french chic by fashion writer suzanne somer unfortunately out of print or a year of style by frederic fekkai unfortunately this book is filled with dated clothing and very little substance to explain the french fashion mystique however there are two other great books that are keepers the first is frederic fekkai a year of style the famous french stylist does an excellent job of showing you how to be beautiful with easy and simple ideas to use throughout the year the second book is a guide to elegance for every woman who wants to be well and properly dressed on all occasions by geneviere antonine dariaux madame genevieve antoine dariaux former directrice for nina ricci shares her extensive expertise on creating the classic french look 
disappointing i do usability inspections as part of my job i bought this book based on nielsen s reputation and the description of this book here on amazon com i was very disappointed to find that this book was scholarly not practical after scanning the book i returned it for refund 
horrible mistake in regards to persian golf what the hell is going on i wonder wich rich royal family in the mid east has funded this unbeleivable mistake for your info the persian golf has existed for thousands of years up until your edition what happened are you taking advantage of the last moments in mullah history before they are overthrown to clinch a deal with the arabs i am really disapointed and did not think that a non for profit organisation like yours would do such a mistake recalll all copies or face legal actions samvancouver canad 
do not waste your time lousy this is one of the worst written books i have ever read i wish i had saved my money and my time the book is full of superlatives everything is the best ever experienced again and again the characters never become embraceable one male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk the female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware but is really just stupid her friend is promiscuous which is all we ever really get to know of her the writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader but the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader very inappropriate not sure who would really like this book maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot story development characterization or any other facets of literature find yourself something with a little more substance and i think you ll be much happier 
decent class of cover thats it approximately pages of hybridised vacuity build from snippets of information coralled together i can best describe this work as almost entirely cliche ridden it is further evidence that human computer interaction studies are largely solutions in search of problems the chapter on megacreativity is replete with casual opinion and banal anecdotes likewise chapters on the new education and new medicine are pitched several degrees below what the average time or news week reader would expect in content overall this is a poor piece of work in terms of content and i regret having wasted money on it at some point in time i hope that a shokal equivalent emerges to debunk the self aggrandising twaddle that typifies most hci work 
everything is a conspiracy these days i bristle at the suggestion that perhaps roosevelt knew of the attack but did nothing to stop it as if a repulsed sneak attack would not have convinced america to go to war the conspiracy theory holds that roosevelt had the carriers shipped out of pearl leaving the obsolete battleships to be destroyed in the attack the one glaring problem with this theory actually there are several problems but i consider this the most compelling can be summarized in a single word oil a huge amount of oil was stored at pearl such a huge amount in fact that the carriers and subs would have been out of action probably for an entire year if the oil had been destroyed the value of that oil was tremendous and roosevelt would have been absolutely demented to risk it it was pure luck that the japanese did not target it they actually planned to hit it on the aborted third run additionally roosevelt was a former navy secretary who referred to the army as quotthemquot and the navy as quotusquot it is way beyond belief that he would have sacrificed the battleships and their crews much less the oil it s always sooooo simple to monday morning quarterback a lesson to keep in mind today regarding iraqi wmd 
disappointed both of the recipes i tried were total flops i made the savory scraps on p it is supposed to produce squares from an x pan but the result was a crumbly non cuttable mixture that i had to stir into the dog food the other recipe mutther s day puppy seed bread on p turned out burned on the edges raw in the center and unedible for my dog i pride myself in being a good cook who can follow a recipe i think they failed to verify their ingredient lists for these recipes i hesitate to try any more of the recipes perhaps they didn t verify the ingredient list my dog likes the food and the notations in the cookbook are very cute but i think the customer should expect the recipes to turn out 
might be good if written by a high school student i would really like to know the average age of the reviewers who rated this book favorably i read pages and finally had to quit i just couldn t keep reading the writing is very unimaginative the authors have a very limited use of vocabulary the sentences are short and stilted and they often use the same adjectctive or other words repeatedly to describe a scene or other point of the book once you pick up on this you can t help but notice it over and over throughout the book the resemblance to lord of the rings is almost laughable at one point the kender character which would be the hobbit says something like i used to own a magic ring once have i told you about it duh another thing that is really annoying is the authors constant use of exclamation points instead of using clever and sophisticated writing to make a point the use short sentences punctuated throughout with exclamation points again once you notice it there is no ignoring it and it becomes more and more irritating where were the editors young adults may find this book interesting which is scary as for me this shows what poor writing it takes to get someone to claim a book is one of the best they ve read it will be a long time before i give another weis hickman book a chance my time is too valuable to waste it on such poor writing 
wish i could get my money back as a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler this book was a big disappointment i bought this book after reading the reviews and wish i hadn t paid more than for it while the title the unprocessed child accurately describes laurie s upbringing this book shouldn t be grouped with other unschooling literature the author while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter reminds me of the mother in love you forever who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son s room at night to spend time with him sweet but a bit creepy the fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with laurie pretty much says it all the mother clearly has her own issues that i hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she s not spending with her only child we have been unschooling each of our four children since birth challenging temperments and all and i feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them if you want to read a good book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter i would recommend homeschooling our children unschooling ourselves those authors offer more balance and eloquence than ms fitzenreiter 
dont waste your time or money terrible and pretentious writing i tried to read this book without much luck if you have trouble sleeping this is the perfect sleeping pill 
what a silly immature book what a silly immature book the publisher should have packaged up some rabid froth to go with it 
more money talk to the polish and south koreans and ask them why they do more with less 
too slanted this book is so slanted to the left that i could not finish it because i ended up on the right the endless accusations of fascism and nazism to the people on the conservative side are tiresome gerry has a great novel called half moon and empty stars and that is a book 
go to church you ll learn more i bought this book hoping for a christian perspective on the christian themed the davinci code by dan brown what i paid for is unabashed preaching on how the gospel can be spread through never re interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the bible these two theological scholars don t add any additional light to brown s story nor do they actually show proof that the davinci code couldn t have been true which in fact i agree that most of brown s work is fictional interpretation it seems like another opportunity for christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the mass media and the general population pure back patting fluff 
lack of detail what can i say this book lacked all the details i wanted to read and was pretty darn predictable to boot i could tell that it was written by a foreigner because it never contained any advanced vocabulary always just kept mentioning the same food and the same feelings and the same blah blah blah enough i m done with this thing 
discard it this is one of the worst books i have ever read its title deceives us we expect to see things like kittens are cuddly or mothers love us instead we read snow is white and rain is wet we are led to believe there is something important in whiteness and wetness but these are merely descriptions of the world about us in giving such bland descriptions the author attempts to derive values from facts in effect deadening our senses to what should be depicted for children as a wonderful world the fact of the matter is there s nothing important about this book at all discard it ! 
same sh different day clearly this book was written to shock and disgust the reader it largely succeeeds the overriding weakness of the book is that all the characters basically act sound and view life in the same way after reading a couple dozen pages i noiticed that you could simply insert the name of one male charater into the place of another and not really notice any difference all the men are ignorant physically abusive and shiftless drunks of somewhat varying degrees i wonder if this work would have been more interesting if selby took one of the stories in leb saystrike and provided more depth about the character s history and motivations this work suffesrs from the same fatal flaw as richard wright s native son although a much different work the main character s is are simply unlikeable and repellant the reader has no reason to care what happens to them 
pornography ! and i normally love sabrina jeffries i won t go into the plot synopsis here since it s been pretty well outlined by the other reviews but all i have to say is that this book is fueled by nothing but lust i want love in the books i read romance in my romance novel not porn i ve enjoyed books by sabrina jeffries in the past the forbidden lord after the abduction but never seduce a scoundrel was disgusting when the characters are giving each other orgasms through petting at page something s wrong i mean these two people didn t even know each other each distrusts the other for good reasons and yet they have their hands in each other s clothes and are playing sex games the pirate and the captive on the second day that they know each other how sick is this im not a prude but this was just too much how many people in modern times behave like this let alone english girls in i hardly think a virgin on the marriage mart would have jumped the bones of a man she barely knew like this not realistic and even if it were i don t want to read about it ! physical attraction should be an added bonus to growing feelings of love and affection not the sole reason a couple is together i want to read about people falling in love with a person not just that person s body as if sex alone is enough to sustain a meaningful relationship this is the second time i haven t finished a novel by sabrina jeffries because it was so overloaded with sex and devoid of romance the first time was with one night with a prince now never seduce a scoundrel had let me down i ll give her one more try to redeem herself but i m about ready to give up on sabrina jeffries work 
couldn t finish this one it s rare that i don t finish a book i realized after getting of the way through it that i just couldn t get interested in the characters took it back to the library a friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience harris other books were much better 
the highest bottom drunk ever if you are at the top of your profession totally successful financially secure surrounded by hot babes driving a porsche and you have a desire to stop drinking this is your book wait on second thought that is the whole book you can read this review or blow and read the longer version your choice 
presumptuous the first page of this book reinforced my belief that no one should attempt to reproduce jane austen s writing style the cumbersome results always sound as if they were written by mr collins presumption an entertainment is no exception hopefully someone someday will have the good sense to keep the wonderful characters that jane austen created get out of their way and allow them to tell the story it would be that simple if the right person chose to do it 
the plot itself could make a movie on lifetime or oxygen do yourself a favor don t waste your time with this book 
not what i expected after purchasing this book i found that most of the tvp products needed to be purchased from an online store rather than making it yourself unless you want to keep running to your local health food store or buying online i would look elsewhere for tvp meat substitute cooking ideas personally i would rather make my own chiken thats how they spell it strips nuggets etc or beef substitutes as a right of passage rather than buying them that s what i thought i was getting when i bought this book but no 
fun read lots of hyperbole quite biased selectively documented trying to make an exciting context the author exaggerates and connects dots that are not ther 
love for a lifetime building a marriage that will go the distance i found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written but also insidiously demeaning to women rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships the author focused on the weakness and instability of women in addition his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage i found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes my fiancee and i have read chapman s five love languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
well written but low on content i found this book very entertaining and interesting to read watts surely excels at presenting his work to as to make it appealing to large non technical audiences however i happen to have a technical background and while i cannot comment on the sociological value of the results of this new science of networks it seems fairly clear that there are no hard results of any significance in this work watts claims to be a mathematician but all he seems to have done is to construct some simple mathematical models and run computer simulations on these what s wrong with that you ask well that is just how should i put it delicately trivial work no mathematics department would let him get away with a phd for this which doesn t really mean anything in and of itself but this was all the book written by a self proclaimed mathematician has in terms of hard facts or rigorous results there s a lot of discussion and speculation and interpretation which is all very interesting but very little scientifically rigorous original work of any value i noticed some other reviewers saying that this is not an easy read but is worth the effort i m not being the least bit snobbish or arrogant about this but i found the book fairly easy to read as would anyone with some knowledge of mathematics and wouldn t advise any laypeople to waste their time don t bother following watts intellectual travels as a researcher it may not be easy to read but there s not much there anyway i haven t said much about the actual content about the book so here goes watts identifies the small world phenomenon aka i can reach the president of the us through at most six steps as occurring surprising frequently in the world around us he sets out to understand the why and how of such a phenomenon now this is a rather hard problem to answer in a mathematical framework because such real world networks are very difficult to model watts and his phd advisor evidently realized this but went ahead and constructed some very simple models of such networks and tried to analyze these models so far so good but even these simple models proved too hard to analyze mathematically so they had to resort to running computer simulations and explain the results in qualitative rather than quantitative terms they made some interesting observations but frankly this ain t no work of genius or anything close running simulations when one can t analyze a mathematical model is something all too many graduate students in various engineering disciplines do on a regular basis but most of them don t have the gift of writing and finding the right audience that watts does in my opinion these toy models and simulations have nothing deep to say about anything in the real world further in my opinion this so called new science of networks which seems to be attracting a fair bit of attention will have absolutely nothing useful to contribute to any real world problems in the words of dennis miller that s just my opinion and of course i could be wrong but stay tuned and we ll see 
the book travels well worn trails i ve read o conner stone and sinclair s biographies of london plus big swaths of others including his daughter joan additionally i ve read many articles seeing a video interview of his youngest daughter becky was also interesting and now i ve read kershaw s biography it covers really no new ground though it does expand a bit on the voyage of the quotsnarkquot yet if one wants to get into that voyage specifically there are johnson charmain london and jack himself to fall back on re journals and articles of that voyage i m afraid i agree with the quotkirkus review quot writer concerning kershaw s biography included on this site there was just too much rehash crib note stuff of his stories and books kershaw wasted time he got into works of fiction at length that are bad amongst london s most agonizingly blatant hack work quotburning daylight quot and more than anything he did not try and plumb the depths of his wildly contradictory acts and words not the least of which was london s addled racism lastly he did not thrust london and his fame into proper context he began to do it then backed off a reader gets too little social context and with london thats really necessary still i found the book worth reading and if this work was the reader s first biographical exposure to london i can see where it would work far better 
ti must have cut mr hornsby a big check i m taking a precalc class that uses this text as a refresher before beginning an undergraduate degree in physics in the early i d taken algebra statistics precalc and even a few calculus classes over math classes in all out of all the math texts i ve used this is by far the worst the examples are so poorly explained i always end up having to refer to one of my old texts the book was written to be used with ti calculators only problem is no key stokes on how to perform a particular operation are included normally this should be the realm of your trusty owners manual but if a math text is geared for a particular brand of calculator and the faculty at your college are forcing that brand of calculator down the students throats then the book should offer some instruction on the calculator i m actually thinking about finishing my math at another college that does not use this text if you re just looking for a reference book for precalc look elsewhere 
good ideas but beware this book has great ideas for cupcake flavors and frosting fillings but the cakes themselves are lackluster in attempts i have yet to make anything better from scratch than i could make with a betty crocker mix which is a lot of work for semi satisfying results 
ramblings of a dirty old man heinlein is a great author when he sits back and tells a story he s one of the best glory road and citizen of the galaxy are wonderful and the moon is a harsh mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan this however is an awful book it s not merely one of heinlein s worst it s one of the worst books i ve ever had the misfortune to read the problem isn t that there s no action although there isn t the problem is that there isn t anything of substance to replace it there s lots of sex but not in enough detail to be titilating there isn t a love story either you can t have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason the book just rambles aimlessly until it ends maybe heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity but if so he failed miserably the characters in this book aren t just from a different culture they aren t people at all they re too flat if you want to think about such things ponder them on your own or read a different book i suggest left hand of darkness by ursula le guin i will fear no evil reads like an old man s rambling personal fantasies someone must like it but i can t recommend it even to the most devoted heinlein fans if you re tempted do yourself a favor and re read stranger in a strange land instead 
silas marner review if you do not have to read this book don t it is very difficult to understand and catch on to especially because of the slow plot build up and the overall slowness of the book it has a nice meaning to it but hard to understand because of the way the author words things 
am i missing something here excuse me but i see no literacy historic wonder here what i read of this piece of trash is this is a piece of obscene garbage men with objects shoved up their butts men forced and enjoying to perform explict graphic sex with other men extreme cruelty women having graphic sex with each other women having their butts spanked and blistered what plot what i don t understand is how these series of books ever passed a censor and why they don t have some kind of warning on the covers dont be fooled into thinking this is a profound work of art it is an excuse of writing it should be rated xxx and kept out of the hands of anyone under if booze is illegal before that age then this vulgar sex book should be also i don t care if this is ms rice fantasy she should keep to vampires and leave her imagination on this field alone i can just see some weirdo sex offender feeding on this stuff for his performace on the next victom it can give any one ideas on how to hurt people in the real world there are enough bad things being done to others without fresh new ideas to apply to the world of cruelty 
the book sucks but there may be hope to rehash about other reviews this book is tripe worthless offensive to anyone who felt any connection to this series world and characters i think i may have a pretty good idea of what happened though and i hope it gives some hope for the future it s the michael crichton syndrome remember long ago when michael crichton wrote extremely entertaining novels based wholly on his strengths he is obviously very bright and has a real talent for turning ideas about hard science into fun dramas like the andromeda strain then he became so popular and so lauded that he started to believe his own hype he read so many reviews of his own books citing him as the greatest writer ever and as the man whose every word was golden that he started to believe it and so he started to write books filled with what he thought was subtle intrigue pithy character interaction and literary depth unfortunately he wasn t that kind of writer he wasn t delillo or dickens or wolfe and he shouldn t have tried to be so those books ended up being further towards the crappy end of the spectrum then something happened i don t know if his editors pulled in the reigns or if his family sat him down to have a talk or maybe he started to pay attention to the fans that he was disappointing i hope whatever it was it got him to accept a bit of humility and to go back to his strengths the results being timeline and then prey fun books about hard science extrapolated into entertaining dramas so therein lies my hope for robert jordan his strengths are in describing an interesting world in creating things that are mysterious and engaging and in writing very cool action sequences recently he seems to think he s the next f scott fitzgerald and failing spectacularly he obviously for example thinks that he has something deeply important to say about the sexes and about the clash of cultures and maybe he does but he sucks at saying it more importantly it s not why we read the wheel of time if we want to read about the subtleties of culture and its affect on the interactions we have there s plenty of dostoevsky available mr jordan obviously possesses a stubbornness akin to that he ascribed to the people of the home village of his protagonists whoever they are anymore i just hope that eventually someone will smack him hard enough to wake him up and we ll find ourselves with another eye of the world or the great hunt 
the book is a joke and a rip off the book is very poor the technical part is useless the author is either totaly confused or he s doing this on purpose trying to bluff people and get their money i really do not understand how mcgraw hill has accepted to publish such a ridiculous book i beleive they should hire stronger technical advisers in the future 
one of the most cliched lackey books up until i moved on to other authors i had read pretty much everything mercedes lackey had written my opinion is perhaps a bit biased now since i m no longer interested in her writing and cringe somewhat when i read it however even back when i really loved what she wrote this book never worked for me ill try to avoid repeating what others have said so except for the first point this will just focus in on some of what stood out to me first of all this one has been mentioned but i wanted to underline it i m not sure how accurate it was as far as native american beliefs and practices if someone who is a native american from the specific people group the main character hailed from would like to comment on this i would be most interested lets not get any more education of little tree type books out there shall we next one of the things that annoyed me was the treatment of sex now this is certainly at least partly based on my feelings towards sex in general as being something meant for marriage only however i got annoyed with the way that jennifer s grandfather felt that sex would solve all of her personal problems okay maybe not all of them but still from my real life observation if someone is stressed and dealing with all sorts of personal issues sex isn t going to be anything more than to paraphrase someone close to me a bandaid covering up the splinter so you don t have to actually take the splinter out ie a solution that lets you avoid the real problem you might feel better for a little while but it s not going to fix things and considering the way things were between her and her former lover i wasn t convinced that sex would help rather i thought it would confuse things they had reasons for breaking up reasons that i didn t feel were fully dealt with jumping back into bed with each other wouldn t solve her problems it would make them that much more painful a few months years or however long it took down the road when they had to break up again because they hadn t fully figured out whether they should be together or not this is one of my main issues with lackey s books she uses sex far too lightly without generally looking at some of the consequences that come in real life finally here s my biggest issue with this book which also ultimately became one of my issues with lackey s writing in general in this book she seemingly bends over backwards to be openminded and fair towards people of all races genders religions etc she in fact states this several times in case the reader didn t get the point everyone should be accepted have equal rights etc so if this is her belief why is it that every single wasp white anglo saxon protestant male is an abusive heavyhanded racist sexist etc jerk and i m not sure on this but i seem to remember that every wasp female was abused timid and frightened although generally wanting to be good i know that wasp males have caused a lot of damage in the world however they aren t the only ones and there are plenty of them that are great guys and honestly at this point in time pretty much the only people groups out there at least in any large numbers are those who at one point in time in history conquered and frequently did horrific things to other people groups wasps just happened to be the most recent and most successful worldwide at doing this this annoyed me so much that i couldn t appreciate much of the rest of the book so there you have it some aspects of the book were alright but unfortunately they couldn t outweigh these negative issues for me 
the book says all spirituality is imagined the book states that all spirtuality is imagined and anyone who believes otherwise is a fool this is very atheist and offensive i may have been better off buying another book 
one of the worst books i ve ever read good grief ! the book is basically a crash course on new age thinking disguised as fiction unfortunately the insights are bad philosophy full of circular reasoning and self contradictions the details that are not relevant to the message are inaccurate for instance the point that looks out over machu picchu is not accessible by jeep martin luther never called for an end to the papacy and only two very small portions of the old testament were written in aramaic it s bad logic fruitless philosophy bland dialogue and just generally awful fiction the only thing i got from this book was a better understanding of why the new age movement will never get anywhere when your whole world view is a circle all you see in front of you is the back of your own head how could you ever find enlightenment like that 
hello my name is bertie wooster i mean jason bourne i mean this poor unfortunate book has a tragic case of identity crisis it is wodehouse dressed up as mi and the whole getup just looks absurd hugh laurie is actually a pretty good writer especially for someone whose day job is acting but this particular fairy tale was unsuccessful the protag is amusing and the narrative is pithy however the plot is one which requires the reader to sympathize with the characters basically i didn t laurie spent so much energy trying to make his protagonist funny and forgot to make him interesting or loveable i m a little bitter about that because i m pretty sure dr house is capable of better work come on give us better ! chop chop ! 
this book is not worth the paper it s printed on this book should get stars speaking as an artist myself the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics etc to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse admittedly i could not even finish this book after reading for the nth time a line of shaky circumstantial evidence like all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw but there are no correction marks therefore optics must have been used i could not even stand to keep reading ! on the contrary all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction that is just one example the book is filled with flaky examples such as those hockney claiming this is too good to have been done without optics or this was too difficult to have been done without optics and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art if that is indeed what he thinks and modern artists must remember this nowadays the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists for many reasons superior art education is very hard to find and there are many distractions in the modern world tv computers having to hold a day job lack of patrons etc and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did therefore most will never attain the skill of the old masters but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology some of the other examples used as evidence refer to odd proportion perspective etc in otherwise masterful work i am surprised that this author and those readers who are artists apparently does not realize that throughout history great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism even nowadays photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists because after all we are artists not cameras ! the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality not to copy it ! therefore many inconsistencies in proportion perspective etc evident in old masters work are not oddities or mistakes but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition all that being said i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of trickery or technology of some sort instead an art student should be encouraged to build skill discipline and self reliance because that is the true secret of the great masters 
unfinished seemed like a good start however pages were missing and i had to return it am waiting for you to send it to me and i will be happy to review it the 
utopic islamic insurrection is not imploding the author develops an original argument that the islamic insurrection is imploding on its own in other words osama bin laden s jihad is viewed as intolerable terror against innocent civilians by a majority of muslims over time the muslim peace lovers will progressively dwarf the ranks of the jihadists in the author s mind this is especially true if the u s gets out of the way and stop waging an ill fated war on terror that keeps throwing oil on the fire of the jihad movement he makes a case that the u s ongoing backing of israel and its invasion of iraq have strongly boosted al qaeda s ranks the author belongs to the camp that believe that the islamic insurrection is almost solely a counter reaction to u s foreign policy it certainly is a factor but how can it be the main driver was totally unsolicited also prior act of terrorism were more often than not caused by the u s government becoming friendlier towards various middle eastern ones rather than the opposite thus whether the u s supports or attacks a middle eastern state it appears as justification for act of islamic terrorism what kind of rational is that the pew global attitudes surveys and current events don t support any of the author s original arguments osama bin laden s aura is ever increasing islam is becoming increasingly fundamentalist and violent throughout the middle east and africa wherever it overlaps with christian population bloodshed results more often than not executed by the muslims and suffered by the christians such as in somalia rwanda and sudan so the main thesis of letting islam extremism implode on its own just does not hold well to any reality check right now it is picking up steam big time instead i recommend a far more prescient book on the subject samuel huntington s the clash of civilizations he has a far better understanding of islam s extremism from a geopolitical and demographic standpoints 
a complete waste did anyone bother to check any of the recipes in this book i think not not only are some of the ingredients difficult to get a hold of the end product is a disaster how difficult is it to compile recipes that have actually been made not very but apparently it s much easier to just make them up like many have posted here it is not the occasional recipe but a substantial proportion of them i think martha owes us all a hefty refund if not for the time money and effort wasted as least for the book ! for now this one goes in the fire kindling pile 
i d return it if i wanted to waste more time because of it a page book of which the last pages are appendices a glossary and an index pages of the appendices are nothing but a listing of nasdaq stocks symbols and sectors buy ibd instead for including the first pages you will find much info but very very little substance and discussion it s but a compendium of data don t buy this book if you are seeking knowledge about how to trade 
do you real science read some cavalli sforza this is pseudo science on its worst with fake manipulated results from a scientist that has no commitment with coherent data analysing in order to attest its discoveries when nature and science magazines publish cover stories on the fallacy of human biological races you just cant keep on thinking about if the results of this uber nationalist biased researcher are really as true as he affirms sad 
being greek while this book is a relatively interesting read as a greek woman i find it extremely insulting this book takes every stereotype out there and looks for evidence that it is true robbins goes looking to find the information she needs to prove that greek life is sordid and scandalous this book also over generalizes implying that all sororities are like this one not caring that this is the account of a very small selection of sororities and greek women as a member at a smaller school i can honestly say that most of the stuff that goes on in this book i have never even come close to seeing happen robbins goes into researching this with a very biased opinion and it shows throughout the novel while some parts are true they are not true to the extreme robbins makes them there is also very little focus on the good done by a sorority philanthropy is a huge part of who we are some schools may not take it as seriously as others but there are many sororities who focus on doing good the sisterhood also isn t shown in the best light in this book i have met so many girls that i am so close to now this book doesn t show the closeness between sisters a sorority can bring this book starts off with a very offensive tone by the way robbins describes the girls at the greek boutique we were our letters with pride we want others to know how proud we are of who we are and olive green and green are two extremely different colors thus why the distinction is needed to get a truly accurate account of a sorority life it would take more than the word of four girls at one or two schools interview hundreds of girls from all over the country at all sizes of schools and all sizes of chapters for an accurate account this book is just another stereotype that we will have to fight 
somewhat disappointing i don t want this to be misconstrued as a knock on the author because i think he s a great author and a great writer i m simply critiquing this particular book on what it s done for me and that s not very much this book works if you ve never written anything in your life and know absolutely nothing about writing otherwise it s a bit of a waste of time it didn t offer me anything that i could learn from that i couldn t get from something else if i have to read another book that goes on and on about how the first thing about writing is you have to write you have to write a lot and you also have to read a lot forgive me but i think most educated or even semi intelligent people know that whatever your passion is whatever you want to do in life you have to do it most don t need to be told you re already doing it because you love it hence why you want to do it forever we don t need to be talked down to like an idiot and that s the problem with some of these thespian overly educated writers is that their snobs and they write in a way that is condescending they are basically saying it s this way or forget it your wasting your time they didn t invent writing writing has been around for centuries this book strongly emphasizes how important it is to outline and that you ll be doing it for the rest of your life but it doesn t give you clear and excellent examples of something so critical instead it gives you sample charts of time travel from his science fiction books if i had to hear one more comparison about what this author did with his science fiction books i was going to throw the book out the window i was really hoping for more actual writing tips on grammar and sentence structure but no such luck i do have a couple fantastic writing books that i loved and i found to be absolutely beneficial and they are bird by bird by annie lamott and on writing by stephen king both of those books were funny and witty entertaining and packed with very informative and helpful tips for the writer in you they are much more evolved writing books to check out and help you get better at doing what you love most 
zoolander on the wagon interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring about half way through i had to quit it was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl will he call me did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me all i do is think about him is he thinking about me oh please please please let him say something to me i love you but i m not in love with you on and on the humor is mildly amusing but seems forced it doesn t ring quite true like the author is trying too hard an earlier negative reviewer said they didn t like the author it didn t prevent me from reading the book i like the writing of a number of unlikable people but i now understand the book is completely about this shallow person his struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting humane things about him his colleagues force him into rehab which turns his life around he returns to work a changed and invigorated man loving life but continues to mock the people who saved him it doesn t dawn on him to thank them 
dont buy my goodness this book droned on and on about belonging and longing without any real wisdom coming through i will never buy a book again because someone else said it was good i lost money on this one 
sort of cheating this book is exactly the same as handbook of technical writing by same authors the only difference is in the cover picture and colors i think it is not a cool thing to sell the same book with two names without mentioning it so if you have that one do not buy this one they are exactly the same 
eat great lose weight miniature edition i was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature some of the pages were blank having not even been printed i figure the book was a total loss of money spent 
revisionist history at its worst this is a work that pretends at objectivity but is written with a clear agenda in mind pappe totally identifies with the palestian arab cause and places the major onus for the conflict on the jews of israel thus he slants the major historical and political realities in which the jews have five times agreed to a peace plan based on partition while the arabs have insistently refused to accept the jews right to a state of their own pappe underplays the persistent and systematic arab violence and terror which have been at the heart of the conflict from its beginning he mistells the story of the war minimizing the arab agression the calls of the leaders of arab states for palestinians to temporarily abandon their homes so that invading arab armies would be able to kill jews more freely he underplays the countless initiatives made by israelis from all walks of life to live in peaceful relations with the arabs and does not really put the conflict into the context of the pan arabic islamic fundamentalist and arab nationalist processes which perpetuate the conflict even today this is revisionist history at its worst a distorting and ignoring of the factual and objective reality in order to promote a cause that cause is disguised and misrepresented in the work for pappe as anyone who reads carefully will see is calling for a jewish state which ceases to be jewish in any meaningful way and eventually becomes an arab dominated one in which its arab minority will eventually become its majority pappe s analysis is one which aims to help bring about the destruction of israel is it surprising then that most israelis consider him to be both a hypocrite and a traitor 
what to expect way off the mark i read this book after reading what to expect when you re expecting and was very disappointed i liked expecting most likely because while pregnancies differ the biology is pretty much the same for everyone so it s hard to miswrite pregnancy however after reading first year i have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child s behavior or abilities i know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different but i m not talking about when kids will walk or talk i m talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that i want my son to help clean up if i hand him a paper towel additionally the book does not always offer a good answer to a question the answer usually comes in the form of some babies will some babies won t how is that helpful after noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false i finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy in long i do not recommend this book to anyone particularly a first time mother 
not for the vegan baker first this looks to be an excellent book if you eat eggs and dairy if you follow a plant based diet this is not the book for you there are handful count maybe recipes that don t have eggs and dairy it is possible to substitute earth balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs if you want to bother for some reason i thought that because it has buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant based baking 
glad to be done with it predator is the worst book i have read in months i read a lot of books it is too dis jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events the characters are poorly drawn i hardly recognized the scarpetta and marino of earlier books the transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak leaving me feeling huh this the fourth and it will be the last book by cornwell that i have read it was totally disappointing and i spent extra time on it just so i could complete it and forget about it 
boring book i read a lot of books and have been doing a number of reviews and this is one of the only books that i couldn t finish after beginning to read this book i found that it just bounced all over the place the book was not focused on anything or anyone in particular especially andrew jackson if the book did focus on one thing in particular then it was details of the types of personalities some of the men around jackson had which i am not sure how one could be so familar with that not knowing any of the people personally sure you can learn something about personalities from letters but the detail about personality types was too much spending too much time on small detail does not make for great reading nor does it help one to see the big picture behind the story so if what you like in a book is learning about personality types you will love this book the book also seemed to be written by a some what biased point of view by the author the title should have been something like politics in the early s this book will not keep your attention from one page to another if you want to know more about andrew jackson spend your money on something else ! 
overly heady writing style i found very little useful information in this book not because it isn t there but because the writing style is too out there i m sorry i bought it 
pages of total immersion italian the is by far the weakest grisham novel i ve ever read the first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist joel backman more about him later wanders italy for nearly pages learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with italian carictatures that would make chico marx cringe when grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense it s all for naught as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending as for joel backman i can t think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory a disgraced lawyer lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power all the while causing numerous deaths and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion you read the book and decide 
large book with complex and boring language i am studying for an m s in software construction in denmark and this textbook was assigned to a course covering software engineering this last semester the semester at the same time was focusing on teaching the theory of compilers and computation complexity being from denmark english is not my native language and i must say that the verbose language used in this book sometimes had me pulling my hair it seems i am not alone when i say that most of the reviews here tell about problems with the overcomplex language used i am not sure why the outher finds this necessary there is also much use of references to other somewhat outdated books about the subject i am not sure how many several authors i have read when i finish this one it must be several the left margin is used for key points little advices web references which is a great idea but they do take away the focus of the main text i cannot say whether or not it presents the material correctly or if something is missing or the information is outdated or whatnot i just do not like this book it seems it was written for software engineers already in the field it is the practitioner s approach and the only thing they really need is a grown up presentation of the methods used in modern software engineering and this book does contain that indeed atleast it seems like it this book is not for students which at the same studies technical courses like compilers and complexity theory the intended reader for this book was perhaps never meant to produce source code but instead do the management of these chaotic projects though this i am not sure of since i an not a practitioner but a hardworking student seeing myself reading this while coping with the immense culture shock it is for me to realize that i do not know anything about developing software the book does manage to give away information if read carefully and from one perspective it is not just a waste of money one usefull feature are the examples of dialogs between members working on a fictive software project they are very informative but to use it like is has been done in my situation is just a clear misconception of the reality which lies in the study of the conceptually hard areas of this kind of education bottomlines you like programming mathematics theoretical studies and understand that careful planning and execution of software projects is a requirement get another book on software engineering perhaps the one by sommerville or mcconnels s rapid development are good bets you have been working in the field of software engineering for several years but haven t really gotten the touch of programming or have had ups and downs managing software projects buy this book indeed you ll cope with it just fine 
totalitarianism with a smiling face and radio show the second that you hear someone denounce someone else s politics or beliefs as an illness you can be sure you re in the presence of a totalitarian thinker michael weiner s nee savage diagnosis of liberal politics read democrats as an illness summons up previous political movements that traded in such diagnoses and those movements cures for their sick countrymen nazi concentration camps soviet psychiatric prisons and maoist re education camps where millions of decent citizens were treated for their political illnesses with most patients never to be seen again like his nazi soviet and chinese mentors weiner is a provincial and intolerant political reductionist xenophopic and fearful of change yearning for a return to a mythical better time and relying on the rhetoric of stultifying simplicity those who agree with him are well all others are sick hell hath no fury like a goosestepping jew god help us if some crafty politician ever rises to the presidency by standing on a stack of books such as this 
mostly sloppy and uniformed with a few good bits ambrose writes in a mostly accessible style which is not a bad thing but this book is a mish mash of different magazine pieces that have virtually nothing in common and are quite uneven in quality further some of his work is just pure opinion based on almost no real scholarship his arguments about the bombing of japan or the cold war come to mind for armchair historians who think they know alot about history ambrose is the man unfortunately his unfaultering us boosterism which results in obvious moth worn and erroneous conclusions will not really appeal to anyone else 
plot what plot characters don t me laugh i am a big fan of dick s his short stories are his strength his imagination is superb but this novel is peculiar to say the very least i am well aware that a major criticism of his body of work is the uneven writing sometimes he soars but at other times it feels as though he wrote a book in a week and stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it off to the publisher without giving it another thought this is just such a book how it won the john w campbell memorial award for the best novel of is beyond me it would never get published today the beginning is classic dick a famous man wakes up in a flophouse after a murder attempt on his life and finds that he doesn t exist no records no biography fame all gone a pocket full of money that s it but from that point on the story lumbers from one encounter with a ditzy woman to another it s all rambling filler that has nothing to do with the story the policeman in the title doesn t show up until halfway through granted the story picks up a bit at that point but then it loses its focus again and the ending is a rush job if ever there was one the whole thing turns out to be a drug induced figment of his imagination how disappointing is that that s as bad as those star trek time travel episodes where everyone goes through absolute hell they should all be traumatized for life and suffer from terminal ptsd but then the loop is completed and it s as though none of it ever happened arghhh if you think dick was one of the great sci fi masters of all time read this book but keep it in context with his corpus of work ie somewhere in the bottom half if you are just starting to read dick skip this one for a while but by all means read his short stories some of them are keepers for all time 
well the writing is very good but the true and simple test of a novel is to ask oneself these questions do i care about the characters can i stop reading this book right now and never wonder about how it ends if you answer no to the first question and yes to the second it is not a good work of literature the line of beauty is unfortunately one of these novels tedious overly mannered and stifling 
uninteresting while the concept was certainly revolutionary at the time this book was written i found the story itself uninteresting and sexist i would not recommend this book 
pagan yes wiccan no wiccans find another book there are soooo many great books about wicca out there i certainly wouldn t waste my money again on this book and i suggest others don t either it is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of the movies it is full of false information made just to look cute so it will sell sell sell this book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning wicca or witchcraft in general this supposedly advanced book doesnt go into details on how to make your spells better how to connect with nature how to beome stornger it doesnt encourage deep thinking and lots of factual information it does however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of blue smoke this book is not about a different of opinions or different practices it is about portraying a real serious religion as a fun and games do whatever you want choice as she mixes in things in tradtional witchcraft that has been shown to have the oppsite and or nagative effects as well as doing spells which do not follow the wiccan rede even though i am not in a coven i understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed it is not do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan yes some things in religion are personal choices but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost on her freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways unfortunatly that is exactly what ravenwolf does she doesn t differentiate between the wiccan and paganism in fact she barely cover the topics at all giving vague rehashed information from her other books this book seems a nice commercial cutesy items to make everything pretty and oh so shiny this book is teaching hype not truths this book is demeaning and disrespectful to anyone into witchcraft and wicca alike there are many good books which put things in simple pleasant terms without all the false goofy information spread thoughout this book go pick up another book on whatever your interst wicca witchcraft or paganism and you will undoubtably end up more informed this book will just leave you feeling broke 
ps heck why shd i be sorry for you dan you re sitting on a gold mine 
misleading i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about years however this book is misleading and dangerous almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust mr crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references to support this premise tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust i hope that someday mr crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people s thoughts and actions through his books there is a quote with great power comes great responsibility but in this case it would seem with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet 
stuffy predictable and annoying i borrowed this book a while ago hoping for an enjoyable light read unfortunately not the main character of this series amelia peabody is supposedly interesting unfortunately not obsessed that men are the evil of every age her rants occupy almost every page her supposed insights and commentary were so long that i found myself speed reading through the pages scanning as many as pages every few minutes the sidekick is just as annoying while she isn t complaining about the weather she is busy fainting anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the mummy was what little intrigue there was was ruined by the predictability although the writing was quite enjoyable it was ruined by many of the characters i d take one of the case studies of sherlock holmes over this any day or any book by pd james or jd robb 
just an over rated mediocre mystery at best dan brown s da vinci code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones the characterization seems like it came straight out of a s made for tv movies if you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin the first time the true villain makes an appearance it is basically a well isn t that contrite moment but it is a fast easy reading novel this book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti catholic i think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book althogh there are some kooks that think this book is about reality instead of fiction a much more interesting book in a similar venue modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones is foucault s pendulum by umberto eco be forewarned eco s novel is a much more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel it is analogous to comparing cotton candy da vinci code to a course gourmet dinner foucaults pendulum both will satisfy hunger both are a type of food but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling 
how much help did mr buffone really get mr buffone criticizes parents who financially help their children but i wonder did mr buffone s parents pay for his high priced college degree did they lend him money for his down payment on his first home purchase always look deeper than what you see on the surface 
painful there is nothing practical about this book it is a looooong purely theoretical torture with only a few examples that don t work too well in the real world i had to buy it for one of my graduate classes and here i am three months later even more clueless than i was when i started this book is very boring painful to read it doesn t help that the author is clearly biased in favor of traditional hrm and refuses to give much room to more modern thinking the exercise book is a nightmare the exercises are either impossibly difficult and time consuming because the textbook does not offer valuable guidance for any practical problems or they are an absolute waste of time students basically have to copy a chapter i could go on like this forever in a nutshell buy this book if you have to but sell it as soon as you can 
i didn t like it this book goes into the hearts and minds of the ancient greeks led by odysseus and achilles who are guided by their gods the trojan war is brewing for the greeks and thoughts of slaughtering their enemy the trojans are very strong can the trojans survive will they all live to tell the tale of the trojan war or will they all be killed on both sides it s life or death on their minds have you ever heard of the trojan horse and the victory for odysseus this book includes the story of odysseus and why his son set out to find his father the journey of the ancient greeks to the trojan homeland is included will they return or will they lie in the blood stained desert of the trojan homeland the book also includes odysseusis treacherous journey home past a six headed serpent and right across an evil king s door step will he survive personally i didn t like the book at all the way it was written it didn t really pull the reader in very well and the battle sequences are o k but not the best personally i don t really enjoy some types of myths and legends i think if you are just about to branch out and read greek myths you shouldn t read this book first because it really turns you off to greek myths in general so don t think all greek myth s are like this 
i guess it s the thought that counts catherine crier and indeed every defense attorney and state district attorney in the country had no doubts that peterson did it given both the evidence and his odd behavoir trying to flee the country and being caught in the process but this book is little more then a retold story of something that was already fully documented by those who took the case to court and won thanks but no thanks ms crier 
could have been better i think well the fact that i m writing a review about this book while it s sitting open on my desk next to my computer open and not being read might be some evidence of how i m enjoying this book this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn t be so difficult this book is not clear or easy to understand at all every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page making this work look like a research project for a phd publication i have the casebook in this series and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity and it turns to be true ! this book might be good if you re advanted contracts and want to know every little detail or as an advanced reference later on to look something up like in an encyclopedia some concepts which should be pretty clear just get too in depth coverage in this book it s too complex for a first year student sometimes it starts describing the different views out there and then there s a jumble in your head as to what the law really is i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors 
long and drawn out this seemed too long and too drawn out 
don t buy this book this book is a hastily cobbled together piece of worthless junk written in quotbulletsquot so disorganized as to render the content meaningless it includes such helpful tips as quothire a personal trainer or u s marine corps sergeant to get you going quot believe me your best time management move is to not waste any time looking at this book 
unreadable i was given this book for my birthday and i tried to read it i had such a hard time reading the book which seemed to drag on and on eco seems to go into tangeants and details such mundane scenes that i didn t get past page i am an avid reader and have read everything from fiction to non fiction to classics i just couldn t get into the book and found it difficult to read 
that s it i m done with her i used to love iris johansen s books esp her eve duncan books the last few though have been terrible on the run was the final straw she s lost me as a reader i read about pgs and gave up the plot was so dumb i can t believe she got someone to publish it 
stunk although it had some good parts hence the stars it was very bad overall most of the book was garbage that consisted of applying theories of finance and psychology to why he lost money on worldcom and to use those theories to justify his losses almost saying it wasn t my fault look at rule thats why i lost money if you want to learn about the stockmarket i wouldn t reccommend you do it from someone who bought worldcom and wcom options outright all the way down only a few years ago ! 
save your money remember those fluffy life books the ones written on only half a page with some dippy quote on the other page fisher s books use extra wide margins and line spacing save your money for books with substance like peter lynch s quotlearn to earn quot ben stein s quotbunkhouse logic quot or napoleon hill s quotthink and grow rich quot 
why is the cost so reasonable essentially you get what you pay for this book is certanly not representative of what i have come to expect from national geographic i had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish in the past i ve found photographs by professionals like steve mccurry portraitsvisually arresting not so here at least it only cost me oredering from amazon if i had been able to preview it beforehand i would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
disappointed but what else can you expect i m really disappointed in this book because the author seems to imply that you can have anything you want but that is just not the case it s a deceptive title i can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you you re better off practising feng shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book and i m not knocking feng shui i practise it myself people like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense in the end you ll just feel worse off looking for the next big thing to promise you some more snake oil another fact i d like to point out is that this author sells this book in cd format for around i got a flyer in the mail if he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so called secrets doesn t that go against his own moral values one of the gimmicks of the cds is that you can learn the secret sound of creation as if chanting ahhhh is going to make everything alright thanks to dyer and others like him i am completely against any sort of positive thinking guru they are only after your money while you keep wishing you had more btw you might be interested to know that after reading this book you re only going to find out that the big catch is that manifesting your destiny according to the author only applies to spiritual matters huh yes the entire book promises you can have anything you want but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity the author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with gods plan you don t have a chance either thought i d mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated ! 
wombat waste of money brains and time don t bother complete and utter rubbish too bad this cannot rate zero stars it s not even worth that 
round holes and square pegs i enjoyed re reading the fables by hc anderson again but by trying to link it to the business world it seemed like the author is trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole so to enjoy the book read the fable read the wisdom for the workplace portion as a stand alone some of the ideas suggested by the author are gems although no new ground was broken 
skip the book just watch the movie need i say more than the above title suggests okay so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience there are some touching moments in this book but even then there is still something the author is lacking i saw the movie when it was in theatres and i have just finished reading the book i liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book the movie was funny entertaining touching personal and sad at times the book did not captivate me at all i had trouble staying focused considering beverly donofrio s credentials a bachelor s degree in english from wesleyan university and a master of fine arts in creative writing her quality of writing is very poor her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education if even that and not to go off topic but since donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like columbia u then why doesn t she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life i mean after all the mfa is in creative writing meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time she has only wrote books riding in cars with boys and looking for mary both about her getting pregnant at a young age if you liked the movie just leave it at that don t bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed and if you re interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy then go to the local library don t get this one there s other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one 
wow what a bad book i was very disappointed with this book i was hoping for a clear and concise overview of world history in order to gain a general understanding of major world events and trends the author had only pages to cover the entire span of world history so why does he waste space rambling about vague sociological trends or how one country might possibly have affected another the writing itself is incredibly clunky and unclear and the organization is somewhat confusing i only ever had a vague grasp of the details of a specific civilization before the author jumped to another geographic area and back or thousand years i couldn t even finish the book i d rather spend my time doing something anything else than spend it muddling through this mess 
sisler one of the two most overrated players ever i hope huhn did not spend much time on this project george sisler had a career batting average and that sounds impressive to the few baseball fans who still think batting average is a major statistic but for the rest of us sisler is either as the preeminent living baseball historian bill james calls him the most overrated player in baseball history or as i call him the second most overrated player in baseball history behind roberto clemente the two men had the same problem they racked up very high batting averages for their eras and thus superficially appeared to be great hitters but they almost never walked thus their career on base percentages of which batting average is but a portion were mediocre and neither one of them hit home runs though sisler was especially egregious in this respect he played in one of baseball s greatest launching pads ever sportsman s park where it was down the right field line to straightaway right and to deepest right center and he played there with the super live ball of the s before they put the screen up in that part of the park he also got to play as a visitor in cleveland s league park and ny s yankee stadium when they were generous to left handed hitters as well as nearly three full seasons as a visitor in the outrageous baker bowl in philly the century s greatest launching pad do you know how many hr s the guy hit in his career try so this guy is not baseballs forgotten great this guy is deservedly forgotten because sophisticated baseball fans have come to realize he wasn t great all those years in sportsman s park and he never once hit hr s all those gaudy batting averages and his career on base percentage was lower than those of fred mcgriff alvin davis gene tenace elmer valo jack clark and many scores of other guys who hit nowhere near let alone finally i m aware of sisler s mid career injury and the huge decline in his stats which flowed from it he was a vastly better player before that than afterward and without it he may have been truly great but so what anyone remember don mattingly i remember thinking he was going to replace lou gehrig as the greatest b of all time and i wasn t alone his back injury ruined him and if he still makes the hall it will be only because he was a yankee these things happen and they don t make sisler something he was not and sisler was just as terrible about taking walks before the injury as after next time mr huhn write about a forgotten great who truly was great this book was a waste of your time and is a waste of any reader s time jim f 
state of analytic philosophy of mind at the end of century i sympathize with many of searle s views about the inelliminability of the intentional character of consciousness and the general misguidedness of philosophy of mind but i would ask is this a big discovery why read searle rather than husserl in the first place is his naturalism of any philosophical depth or interest i would say no i believe reading this book is a waste of time as it was for me 
blaming the victims andrew mango is a well known denier of the armenian genocide and this book is unfortunately predictable both in the facts it highlights or suppresses and in its conclusions he glorifies the ottoman past of the country and at best denies without any evidence documented instances of suppression of non turkish ethnicities the most disturbing feature of the author s approach is the indifference to human suffering he exhibits throughout the book for example deniers of the armenian genocide typically make sure to stress what a terrible tragedy the death of so many thousands of people was even though they deny the characterization genocide not a mango he barely mentions the events of but he spends pages and pages condemning armenian terrorists armenian conspiracies etc any qualities of the book are unfortunately dwarfed by such exhibits of callousness and blaming of the victims 
self indulgent piece of crap i m all in favor of silly irreverant books but this book is just so pointless the author doesn t show any skill as a writer it could basically have been anyone off the street making claims like i hate tv animals but i love salem the cat from sabrina the teenage witch this book reads like a stream of concious exercise done by a ninth grader who cares he doesn t say anything really interesting or eye opening about why he does or doesn t like anything for his analysis of full house which he loved all he did was sum up the show then claim it wasn t self important and as some others have written some of the items seem to contradict each other he loves the loamy schlock of full house but hates the corny artificial ness of the brady bunch once again who cares 
designer this is a very nice coffee table book and for a beginning art novice there are some secrets but for artist with general high school level education this is little more than a nice picture book there is no discounting yves lanthier s skill or excellent creative ability but the few tips he gives are not for creating the trompe l oeil ceilings he exhibits in the book rather he shows simple stone marble technique a basic wall effect and basic light shading in the last fifteen pages of the book this is not a book the speaks to basic line and eye illusion of ceiling depth which i was looking for 
abc clio steals from their authors abc clio steals from their authors pays them nothing and robs them blind do not purchase books from them or from their subsidiaries boycott these thieves ! 
there are better books deepak is looking at god through india glasses tinted differently than rose colored perhaps but definitely different than the god i know and love there are better books on the market which explore and take god quotout of the box quot such as tiffany snow s quotpsychic gifts in the christian life tools to connect quot through tiffany s glasses and i know we all wear some version of them i saw many more facets rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of god than i did through chopra whether you are a christian or not i did like chopra s quot laws quot though and some of his other works 
could have done a better job at the beginning of the book too confusing my first philippa gregory book was the queen s fool which i throughly enjoyed i could not waited to have time to sit and read ! so as i was towards the end of the queen s fool i began to see what other books were available by this author i bought the virgin s lover since to seemed to follow the queen s fool within the first pages i was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel too much bouncing about with the time frame and the time frames within the book do not match those in the queen s fool for instance in the queen s fool queen mary dies in winter but in the virgin s lover the queen dies in autumn another example is lord robert in the queen s fool lord robert lives at st james palace autumn and presses queen mary to name an heir winter however in the virgin s lover lord robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife s stepmother si think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use seasons winter is this november december or january february because further in the book the use of winter is used the back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book i spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
the complete greek cookbook boring recipes but the history of cooking in greece makes the book a worthwhile purchase 
very amatuer what a waste of time it was reading this book if you are not very familiar with fw ips or vpn then this may be helpful but if you have been working with this technology and cisco s products that address these technologies asa pix ips vpnk then please don t refer to this joke go online to cisco com and do the research sometimes it felt as if whitepapers were copied and pasted very dissapointed 
this is not her best i have read everybook karen kingsbury has written and i have to say that i struggled to finish this one most of her books are written with many plot lines this book sad to say was very slow and boring she attempted to make so much out of one thought and it did not work well i hope that she returns to her previous style of writing i would not recommend this book to anyone if that had not read her before i am positive that they would be left deflated 
this book is very misleading quota medieval feast quot is a children s book on a feast held during the middle ages since i was looking for a book on medieval cookery and this title came up i purchased it i shouldn t have it s a picture book for young children and it has nothing whatsoever to do with medieval recipes or cookery if it wouldn t cost me the price of the book in shipping i d send it back however for children who would like a story with a medieval flare this book is perfect for them with lovely illustrations by aliki 
not my first choice i m sorry to say mr beitler appears to be a really nice guy but the book is often basic broad and opinions are not always well fundamented it is a great source for a lot of researches others did on oc related subjects however this book is for a large part no more than a summary of research findings of these others this book since it provides a lot of findings can be helpful for writing a masters thesis for people who never read about oc before buying this book can at least give you some helpful insights and a lot of advises for concrete action for others maybe kotter or burke can be more useful to gain insight in and knowledge of the subject of oc 
snotty and obnoxious bryson is certainly witty but any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author s snotty and obnoxious tone i can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self image what a whining immature mean jerk and by the way there s a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book 
the legend of bagger vance i am disgusted that you would even think to ask me what my thoughts are i emailed you with a complaint that the copy i bought was listed as new i complained that the page edges gave the appearance they had been torn using a ruler rather than guillatined i was very disapointed with the book and even moreso that you failed to reply to my email i have bought a few books fom you and intended to buy more but your professionalism is so lacking that i think from now on i ll shop elsewhere lindsay elliott afsmpo box kedronqueensland australia ph you have my email address ! 
almost one too many the third book of the bourne trilogy just does not stand up to the bourne identity he lost his character ! he never comes close to bringing jason to life and making him real and yet larger than life like he was in the bourne identity this book calls to my mind the question of who really wrote it i get the same feeling from tom clancy s later works they do not ring of the author s metal there are so many mistakes in this work and it is so cluttered up with half explanations and under developed situations and characters that it would hardly rate a c in any college creative writing class i was very hard pressed to complete the read very sorry to say it is about twice the length it should be given all the flaws requiring the reader to really work hard to finish 
zzzzzzzzzzzz i hate to say this about a classic but i found this book incredibly boring 
un informative the book is not good it claims to be about the quotdirectors vision quot but each exposition is mostly made up the authors personal feelings about one film of each director hardly any information is given about the directors themselves aside from one or two brief sentances at the very end of the paragraph the movie stills which are of extremely poor quality take up half the page in addition no index had been made the directors are listed alphabetically but if you want to find a certain movie or genre you have to skim each page individualy the book is a failure and currently in my bathroom 
waste of money waste of time wow i bought the book thinking it would be a helpful how toguide it was more like a bad novel of someone who had spent too much time in the deep under belly of new york don t waste your money or time on this one it s not one bit helpful amazon com sells better books for a successful restaurant i know i found one and this one was not it 
guess i m just jaded maybe i ve read too many of these serial killer fiction novels but i have noticed that they re always disappointing he heard a doggie barking and wanted to ring its neck he saw the old lady coming and wanted to bludgeon her in the face with a rock hee hee ho ho ha ha i have you tied up now you year old kimmie gibbler ho and i ll talk stupid to you because the author makes me until you actually die because it s better than my dialogue im sick of every other current mystery i read being about serial killers though it doesn t always imply the fact and i hated the heroes particularly stupid sunglass wearing delilah i hated the cop and his horny brat and i hated the girl the pervert killed too what was her name janey kemp like ohmigawd he s such a babe and i am totally going home with him cuz i don t know his name i m like ohmigawd a rich wild retard judge s daughter and am totally going to have an affair with the looozah and get in trouble with bondage and dirty pictures i am so totally hot hey loser hey loser you possessive kinky freak like ohmigawd don t go leaving me here when i m so totally hot what s really sick is when he has the snotty little brat tied up with the radio on after six weeks of knowing him and she says his name is valentino um yeah i hated the girl and didn t feel sorry for her when he killed her in fact the other characters only seemed to agree that she was a hot bee otch along with other characters that made me want to puke this was a bad reproduction of the similar yet far more superior ashes to ashes by tami hoag don t waste your time unless you also enjoy reruns of cop rock if this book were mine i d have burnt it along with mein kompf 
a character driven novel where the characters don t deliver i picked this up because it s considered a classic and i knew it had been made into a movie i tend to think that if a book is made into a movie then the book must be pretty good not so with howard s end the plot in howard s end doesn t progress much outside of an early death and later marraige you have to have some interest in the characters but they just weren t very believeable none of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world i kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance the story is clearly dated and doesn t hold up well so many years later living in today s world it s hard to understand what attracted margaret to henry there definately is an audience for this book i m just not a part of it 
a sloppy critique one of zizek s worst zizek s failed encounter with deleuze will prove to haunt him since deleuze and guattari provded a framework to get outside of lacan which zizek still remains embedded in completely i should say from the start zizek is absolutely brilliant but his slip ups are all too numerous and his hasty publication of books have created an unendurable repetition of content there are content problems with the book and style problems as many of the previous reviewers have truthfully attested to but even the or so pages on deleuze are wrought with references to movies and books and sometimes the occasional refreshing joke but all in all the book probably amounts to real pages of thorough critique the problem is that zizek prepares books by writing books and in reading the most recent big work the parallax gap which zizek calls his most important work one sees that the books of the previous years were a type of movement towards this first i how those interested in zizek might go about critiquing deleuze which is coupled with recommendations for zizek s other works after that i will recommend an alternative route to people interested in a crtique of deleuze outside of those made in other reviews such as deleuze a critical reader if you want to get an idea of how to critique deleuze through zizek i recommend reading lacan very closely and critiquing deleuze through lacan but if lacan is intractable for you zizek is a helpful guide to realize lacan s contributions i would even hasten to add that if one is unfamiliar with lacan one cannot account for the weaknesses and strengths of a text like anti oedipus which has the capacity to perform the same reduction on lacan if one were to buy a book on zizek i think the least scatterbrained and most theoretical hegelian is for they know not what they do but be sure to get the second edition with the very long preface pgs which reconfigures his position now with regard to his previous work organs without bodies is important to see how zizek directly comprehends deleuze s work and at times he reposes problems in interesting directions but it will probably piss alot of deleuzians off and not because his critiques are right on but because he has hardly payed attention to the unique elements of deleuze s philosophy which is to say he critiques deleuze as if he would critique any positive thinker without exploring in depth the complexity of his system zizek is most interesting for his lacanian reading of hegel which is quite good and very interesting his main hegelian idea is that the ontological or the transcendental is created from the failure to fully represent the real in deleuzian terms zizek would say that the virtual is created from the inconsistency of the actual which we then generalize into the virtual therefore deleuze s claims to think without an image are undoubtedly a way to make the reader forget deleuze s own positioning which is mainly from nietzsche and yes for those of you who bash hegel without ever having even read him deleuze is extremely close to hegel in many ways and if you don t understand how they are alike and different you don t really understand the problems either of them face but zizek treats this proximity as if it was an attack which merely just calls into question deleuze s own aversion to hegel which does betray a proximity this is immature but perhaps is only as immature as deleuze s aversion to hegel but deleuze never wrote a critique of hegel in this fashion ! as zizek ahs done with deleuze but zizek did make me pay attention to key passages that i did not before which accent the transcendental nature of deleuze s empiricism zizek s own failure to critique deleuze made me question my own as other readers have deification of deleuze i began to ask why does deleuze call his system transcendental empiricism if he destroys transcendence at every turn in favor of immanence the answer is that deleuze is situated in the transcendental turn in philosophy which reconcieves as the transcendental not the noumenal thing in itself as in kant but rather the situation in which the noumenal and the phenomenal are limits as in heiddeger husserl lacan and merleu pontyrecall the passage in a thousand plateaus that the body without organs is a limit what this means is that deleuze s concept of difference cannot be concieved as something apart from the situation of the human being which does not have access to all of reality recall deleuze s claim that difference is not diversity diversity is given difference is by which the given is given this by which as difference and derrida s differance makes deleuze s immanence very problematic since this middle area is still human the real problem is whether the structure of consciousness expressionism can be extended to the world everything is consciousness because it possesses a double difference and repetition this question is always the question they come back to and it is the shakiest component of deleuze s system it is also the component that needs to be confronted via lacan which unfortunately zizek fails to do in a systematic way plus he writes the book after deleuze dies when zizek had active engagement with his ideas very early on if anything it is good to convince oneself that one is questioning one s own idols if you want a breath of fresh air in philosophy i recommend the books contingency hegemony universality which contains a dialog between ernesto laclau judith butler and slavoj zizek he doesn t make stupid references every seconds in this book i also recommend any book by renaud barbaras desire and distance might be an extremely interesting counterpoint to deleuze another book naturalizing phenomenology is an essential book that deals with what zizek does badly how consciousness studies and cognitive studies contribute to these contemporary thinkers whatever you decide it is true that zizek s critique is essential to understand in order to truly understand deleuze s strengths and weaknesses whether you get it from this book or others if you can remain deleuzian and take lacanians seriously you can only then call yourself deleuzian

so many pages for so little to read i am a strong admirer of alan dershowitz i especially enjoyed his books the genesis of justice and reasonable doubts oj simpson case unlike those books america on trial tries to do way too much it is more like his contrary to popular opinion book where he presents many of his earlier published commentaries on the law unfortunately i found the writings in the current book to lack the cohesiveness and well considered analysis found in the earlier book granted this is not true for every case that he presents however he includes far to many cases for which he simply wants to inject a personal opinion in so doing he misses opportunities for more developed theories of particular cases frankly many of his comments on some of these cases could have been presented in a paragraph i understand that he is trying to explain various aspects of american law by using an assortment of cases but his points become obscure and sometimes repetitive by having too many cases in a format that reminds me of reader s digest or u sa today in sum there is not enough in this book to be useful for serious students of law or history and too many cases for the casual reader i hope that this is not a sign of the dummying down of dershowtiz 
keep jason at crystal lake okay in the movies when jason took manhattan it was easily the worst in the series here jason is taken to costa rica simply appalling this book couldn t decide what story it wanted to tell we start off with the most dangerous game style of hunting humans using death row convicts and a survivor type reality game show we move into outbreak with a genetic manipulation that leads to rapid spreading disease and then get slopped into night of the living dead where anyone killed by jason becomes a infectious maniac zombie this story is simply disastrous i ve been pretty lenient in accepting the new black flame novels on friday the th but not the jason x series i ve enjoyed the others enough this one completely blows though the story could have easily been done without using jason for any part of it and it would have been better the jason f franchise is only used here to try and sell the book the author has no concept of what the whole jason f is for and this is just so ridiculously weak that i warn others to stay away from it 
over rated i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent he had a crappy upbringing that does not make for a good book 
beverly hills sleeper definetly not one of stu s best i think he needs to stick to the stone barrington character or make rick barron s adventures a little more interesting maybe stu needs to read a couple james patterson novels 
a disappointment to say the least as i sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating and i now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled drawing people a technical guide for beginners and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure then if i had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery instead of a full out disappointment not that i blame the author solely most of the blame lies at my door i was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure brune hogath s book aside another devastating disappointment and that it was written by a professor from the academy of art a school that i am still deciding on attending that instead of going my normal route ordering the book through the store checking it out in person and then ordering it online so i could get a fatty discount i impulsively bought the book only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews which all looked favorable now i realise my folly and am yet determining whether i ll pay for it ie keep the book i guess what all of my harping boils down to is the lack of content instead of the quality for i can easily discern bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered from experience and i d say that experience shows equally in all areas not just clothing but in setting up a composition and following through the problem is at least in my opinion that this book is supposed to specifically address clothing and it doesn t for the most part roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing the other three fourths talk about how to properly hold your drawing implement how to properly position yourself if you are drawing from a live modle maintaing a daily sketchbook researching your subject matter the relationships between the head neck and shoulders drawing hands drawing feet drawing eyes and a whole slew of other i wouldn t say irrelavent because they are relavent but not neccessarily the most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure a refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials and bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing it should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips again something bradley discusses on one single page the differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing she didn t bother mentioning that how pants typically bunch up while you re walking seen from the head on profile three quaters and back view another topic she failed to mention some examples of evening formal attire vs day clothes how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up the effect of wearing multiple layers at once achieving that perfect windswept look and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide maybe i m being too harsh on bradley after all she does mention in her preface that there aren t a whole lot of books pertain to drawing the clothed figure and compared to the standard how to books she s leaps and bounds ahead of the rest oh yeah that s another thing she doesn t outline any steps on how to achieve a realistic rendering like first start out with a cone pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom base the sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere note the ripples or some junk like that back to me not being to harsh on bradley i guess in reading she is was a professor in the arts i thought she would have some understanding of the common impediments modern day artist face when depicting clothing for all who have read this drawn out rant two maybe three people and think i m all talk trust me if i had the skills i d come up with my own series of how to draw books and address all of my issues as is i m pretty good at drawing dynamic figures but the second i add clothing they become flat lifeless caricatures and i don t see this book as alleviating my shortcomings much as is my own artistic habits drawing from magazines online pics and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion are a match for the few helpful hints in this book you re better off doing what you ve always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book if you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics if you could write a review mentioning them somehow recommend them to me or whatever i d be eternally in your debt 
same ol same ol i am not excited about this purchase because it is just another hints book like all the other authors i wish someone could come up with a better book pertaining to this subject ! 
simplistic i read this book two years ago hoping that it will give me an insight and an interesting frame of reference for my thesis i was disappointed the only aspect i found useful was the information on the different policies of assimilation of the turkish minority during communism 
series crashes with third book be warned after reading the trilogy i was left wondering what the hell happened i have just read all of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book and is utterly demolished in this clunker pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story one of the most creative stories i ve come across in years of reading fantasy there isn t even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess if you look up anticlimax in the dictionary you ll see a picture of this book from first page to last time is wasted on boring characters while all the good ones are either killed off or just mia for the entire book spoilers ahead what about lyra and her parents somehow she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops over a cup of tea naturally and that s it for him in addition to all that this book doesn t even seem to be connected to the first two none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of or all in the last pages what happened to the story for cripes sake and what happened to the temptation was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it the whole premise is just so lame to start out with as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn t endanger the universe why not leave one open for or years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another supposedly they had more than gonads going for them they survived death together pullman didn t feel like thinking it through he just wanted a gut wrenching ending in addition to that he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the reality of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning all of will and lyra s efforts are futile kind of like guess what religion for the rest of us morons after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa elephant aliens or whatever ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper iorek byrnison lee scoresby instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter this is not children s literature it s a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess it s totally dishonest to sell this as a children s book or even as a competent work of fiction all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one we never get closure on lyra s parents we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from we never see will reunited with his mother we get a lame battle where god dies and no one even knows why or how lyra and will fall in love but have to sacrifice it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever with only flimsy reasoning behind it the mulefa and mary malone s work together amounts to nothing everyone just goes home presumably will goes home although we never see it all that yearning after his mother and so forth nothingthe major enemies are killed off too easily and what about armageddon what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and you get the idea it all just sort of disovles mary forgot to be the serpent or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa another reader pointed out phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series instead the story falls flat under the weight of the author s own agendas and mockeries what a waste of time i can t believe this book actually won awards it stopped being thought provoking and started being inane and silly it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream instead relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime absurd this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life 
the writing never really comes together this is a collection of short stories revolving around the new founder of her own detective agency the book spends a fair amount of time on local color the mysteries if you can call them that are light weight there s nothing wrong with any of that often i want a light read but there were two big factors that i could not get around that make me give a one star rating first the people in botswana are presented very negatively and the men are even worse than the women maybe most botswanans truly are self centered bastards but i found that too hard to believe even so i could accept that depiction in a hard boiled detective book but this is more of a sunny sideup book second the author keeps presenting contradictory pictures of the characters particularly the main character in one story she is shown as exceptionally honest while most other stories show her freely lying in one story she says she would never commit a crime and in another story she steals a car in one story she is attracted to a man who beats and rapes her in some stories she has no interest in any man and in one story she is attracted to an apparently nice man i kept asking myself if the author was trying to make some point by these contradictions but i couldn t discern any theme and came to believe it was simply poor writing 
not a good idea i ve read all of slaughter s books since her first blindsighted and each one only became better than the last i raced through faithless which is great by the way to begin triptych and am totally disappointed in this book it simply isn t worth the read karin slaughter has followed patricia cornwell in departing from her tried and true main character and format to do a stand alone book a horse of a very different color there isn t even a trace of her feminine flair for forensics hows that for alliteration anywhere just a lot of severed tongues and gorey murder scenes and a cast of ugly and unlikeable cretins who made me want to toss the book without finishing it i did finish it but i hated it i understand slaughter is at work on another such book and my only comment regarding a successful writing genre is if it isn t broken don t fix it 
read the tunnel vision review i couldn t have said it better i was looking for an unbiased factual account of the crusades and i definitely did not find it in this book at first i found myself thinking that the anti western bias must be my imagination due to my western heritage however the anti western slant became so blatent that i found it impossible to continue reading this book due to the author s wreckless disregard for simply stating fact without bias i too give it one star for it s only saving grace the extensive list of references 
maybe later snapped this up from bargain books after reading all the good reviews i found it boring and trite from the start and then it got worse after pages i gave up on it maybe later 
communist fish rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales he is shamed into giving them to everyone sounds like a communist primer 
medical genetics this book is extremely limited in discussing how these genetic disorders manifest themselves clinically i would not recommend this book for students who plan to apply their knowledge in the clinical setting explanations of certain genetic terms are not always clearly defined nor are certain biologic processes such as meiosis overall a poorly written book for anyone but a graduate student of genetics 
interesting tests not insightful results this book has some interesting tests to take how romantic are you how much do you know about sex how aggressive are you i was hoping to learn more about myself by taking these tests the results on some tests are difficult to calculate but once you muddle through and find your score you are not really given a good explanation of what your results mean it tells me very little about myself that i scored with the top percent of those taking the test i was hoping for explanations of what my answers say about me this book lacks any deep thought provoking explanations about your answers i was hoping for it to say something about my personality i was looking for more explanation into who i am based on the results of the tests this book lacks the thats interesting factor from your test results i was a bit disappointed by that i took the tests and it seemed to reveal very little about the real me 
stars for this one probably the most over hyped book i ve ever read no spoilerswhere to start this could easily turn into a long review but i don t want it to be so i ll try to keep it short also i ll stay away from the religious views regarding this book and focus on the writing because religion is subjective and everyone can and should think whatever they want about their religion having said that the one recurring thought i had about this book while reading it and while thinking about it after completing it for this review was that it is without a doubt the most esoteric and pedantic book i have ever read now i m not stupid and i can appreciate the beauty of words and the importance of diction but so much of this book was rushdie writing in such a way to make sure that you had no idea what the hell he was talking about there are times when you can be extremely metaphorical and lofty and times when you should just be blunt but for rushdie there is no bluntness and everything must be doused in the most stringy and free formed words he can think of why in some cases it adds to the story in this it doesn t while there are some very good parts in this book they are all surrounded by a lot of words that don t really say anything bottom line you can skip this book however those interested in religion and questioning said relgion will probably read it anyway i would suggest you get a durable copy because you will want to throw it against the wall a few times ps the best part of the whole book for me was towards the end in the scenes between saladin and his father if the whole book had been written like that it would ve been a pleasure 
a bit disappointed i have read several of nicholas sparks books but this one was different for me it was a very very slow start i was more than pages into it before i got interested in the plot i had even considered quitting reading it at times it ended up being an okay story but nothing that i couldn t have lived without reading what i did enjoy is the way mr sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were i would suggest another read from mr sparks like the notebook or the wedding if you want a good romantic read 
facts dulled by unimaginative presentation this may be a five star concept but the execution leaves much to be desired particularly in the illustrations the best that can be said is that the pictures are deeply colored and might make a good stained glass project however the almost uniformly bird seye view of this global village fails to show much difference between the haves and have nots or really to illustrate the facts of any given page we simply see a colorful village from the air over and over the very imagery that might make these facts come alive in a child s imagination is missing some sense of interaction this is a village after all ! would help instead of faces we are given a fly over thus the facts remain mere lists and not emotionally compelling 
preaching to the choir i was very excited to read this supposed classic of sci fi but was left very disappointed how does one take the midieval idea of the devil seriously in the face of a more varied and marvelous universe than anything concieved of in our distant past we must be less anthropomorphic in our ideas about the universe the father s reaction to a perfect but godless alien species is to fear it was set up to fool humans into thinking they don t need god to be moral however that s just it we don t need god to be moral ! even plato asked more than years ago if the good is good because of itself or merely because the gods say it is if morality is only good because god says so then murder and rape can be good if god just changes his mind please in reality the father s attitude is outdated and in fact as frightening as kierkegaard s psuedo religious justifications of terrorism if you re looking for a real examination of religious questions coming into conflict with cosmic issues read something else this is stacked in religion s favor moreover it s written in a very confusing and tedious style do we really need a scientific explanation of why a man s eyes get tired from reading too long just so the theme can be so ridiculous ! 
anti western new age nonsense zukav has a decidedly anti western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking this is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics rather than writing a laconic outline of physics zukav spends the majority of his time praising eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective the reader is referred to any college physics textbook or isaac asimov s history of physics or a good set of encylopedias 
one more in a series of books what is with these british anthologizers how perverse a talent it is to find short comedic stories which are not funny sweet merciful heavens this guy found a john cleese story that was tedious imagine how hard you must work to find a tedious john cleese anything at least in this volume you can tell that most of the authors were trying to be at least a little funny 
this is not leather bound great book but amazon have made a serious mistake in the description they say it is leather bound it is most definitely not leather bound it is leatherette which is not leather leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic don t be fooled it is not leather bound i bought one and was very disappointed i told amazon but they didn t want to know and i see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not 
absolutely worthless i have had this book for many years and never actually found any useful information not one time granted there is a lot of material in there but there isn t enough space to properly cover any individual topic it doesn t even have enough tables or quick reference data so the user would do well to look for the info elsewhere in a proper book as a general rule i now stay away from all of mr whitaker s books he seems to have better editorial skills than technical ones and he always manages to get a lot of garbage published with catchy titles speaking of garbage a couple of weeks ago i took this heavy book to its final resting place the dumpster i did not even want to sell it i don t mean to be vicious i have seen the good reviews but i don t think they are warranted 
pamuk s first novel is a disappointment like many others in my book group i had been looking forward to finally reading something by pamuk and like most of my book group i was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him originally published in turkey in the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one faruk darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive he then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated but much of it can t this should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes even more so if the reader knows that darvinoglu is the protagonist of pamuk s earlier book the house of silence such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of calvino borges and their ilk the basic plot is very straightforward in the mid th century a young venetian gentleman is captured by turkish raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring turkish scholar who happens to look just like him the two men then spend the next few decades cloistered together engaged in various psuedo intellectual investigations of astronomy biology engineering and so on these bring them to the attention of the sultan based on mehmet iv whose patronage waxes and wanes culminating in a lengthy attempt to construct a powerful war machine along the way their claustrophobic relationship swings back and forth and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague whose outcome they are tasked with predicting the book concludes with a brief section which will challenge the reader s assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it namely are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a single person this all unfolds at a glacial pace and the two characters are mere ciphers their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it and this makes for disengaging reading pamuk seems much less interested in storytelling or characters than in grand themes such as the nature of identity the collision of cultures and the very nature of reality but none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly fresh or interesting the tension between east and west is handled in a fairly superficial manner as the turkish master is obsessed with western advances in science and technology while the sultan has a credulous appetite for tall tales and soothsayers this all comes across as a rather ambivalent satire of the fluidity of turkish national character in the end this is not a particularly good introduction to major modern writer whom many have compared to eco calvino borges kafka and kundera however readers who enjoy highly ambiguous works about self identity with unreliable narrators may find this a satisfying read 
one of galbraith s shorter and more polemical works canadian born john kenneth galbraith is probably one of the most influential economists in the west over the last years as a flag bearer of progressive politics and liberals he has a steady history of writing economics treatise that argue his beliefs his latest offering is a short polemic against corporate bureaucracy titled the economics of innocent fraud this book shows how the modern capitalistic economy found in the us is really an economy driven by a small class of corporate managers they not consumers and not share holders are in the driver s seat they determine what gets made who gets paid and what people can buy in the marketplace of goods services and most importantly ideas as such this class is beholden to noone but themselves the books ideas are not new though for such a major economic figure to take it up and argue it with such obvious partisanship is quite new the problem with this book is its writing style it seems to follow a stream ofconsciousness style which makes it difficult to understand what the author is trying to say the book contains many sentences that are not grammatically correct in any sense of the word overall the book s editors needed to have done a better job 
don t waste your money the paintings in this book were of very poor quality some were even smeared couldn t wait to send this back 
still looking for the funny parts this book is devoid of humor or insight save your money and apply it towards adventure capitalist by jim rogers i wish i had 
don t waste your money a very poor effort from the point of view of a child there are many errors in the book that will be caught by a four yearold examples mesosaurus a non dinosaur marine reptile and eryops an amphibian are classed as dinosaurs and my four yearold found these and about others immediately this book does have a saving grace though you can use it to introduce the child to critical thinking skills 
more from mem fox i m a fan of mem fox i use her books in my class this one hunwick s egg is a little disappointing the main character finds an egg and we all expect it to hatch but it doesn t and i missed the point of the book if you like mem fox s books then give it a try 
snack on this well i m not sure what the tastes of previous reviewers are but they certainly are not aligned with mine thank goodness i checked this out from the library instead of immediately ordering it i was appalled to discover how absolutely disgusting many of the recipes sound to give you an idea anchovy balls cooked tongue canapes and mayonaise popovers the poor brits would be dying a thousand deaths over what has happened to their beloved yorkshire puddings in this recipe fancy a recipe for chicken skin because it s in here many recipes favor s recipe stars like white bread read wonder bread american processed cheese cream cheese balls and the equivalent of vienna sausages my stomach trembles and then there are the duh obvious snacks like toast or my personal favorite a recipe for a hot dog and a piece of wonder bread wrapped around it there clearly must have been a struggle to reach the total i also had a good laugh about how often the word oriental is used in a recipe s title dude please escape and enter our new century 
i just wasted my money this book is not for those who want to either learn mathematica graphics or extend their knowledge as in my case it is not clear who the audience is for this book the book starts with graphics primatives points lines polygons etc by page your building d plots of rotated cantor sets that have little to do with the topic at hand by page examples of inverted farey fractions illustrate something having to do with graphics but what it is has already been lost it only gets worse roughly each page has a dense set of mathematica code for generating esoteric graphics and their is about one to two sentences to describe this code you are left on your own to unravel it as and intermediate user of mathematica and one whose been using it since version i find the coding hard to understand remember there is no explation thus this book is not for beginners and folks like me its target is for those who work at wolfram research such as the author and play with mathemeatica all day in this case they already understand the material this book is a disaster 
review of the passing of the great race the passing of the great race was one of the racialist books written between and that would strongly influence the the national socialist party the first was gobineau s the inequality of the human races the second was houston stewart chamberlain s the foundations of the nineteenth century the third was this one and the fourth was lothrop stoddard s the rising tide of color against white world supremacy grant was a lawyer and conservationist who was a firm beleiver in the old order free of bolshevism and socialism and centered around an anglo saxon culture grant always tried to portray himself as more scientific than romantic racial theorists such as chamberlain but his theories actually have little scientific basis for example his division of whites into nordic alpine and mediterranean races is anchored only on the basis of nordic scnadinavians having blonde hair alpine slavs having brown hair and mediterranean italians having black hair even worse is grant s lack of historical basis he considers the french southern germans and poles to be a mix of teutonic or celtic nordic peoples and dark haired alpine peoples who invaded europe from asia but there was never any record of asiatic peoples reaching france or germany at least not after the celtic period his classifications of alpine are also very flimsy he considers southern germans to be of alpine stock completely ignoring the fact that southern germans speak a teutonic language and often have teutonic features such as blonde hair and blue eyes he also considers the walloons of belgium to be alpine ignoring the fact that they are descendants of the celtic belgae who the romans clearly described as being tall with blonde and red hair sounds nordic to me he also claims that the irish and welsh have substantial amounts of mediterranean blood ignoring the fact that both those peoples are celtic and often have blonde or red hair the most puzziling part of this whole thing is how this book became so popular when practicaly everyone is labled as inferior grant considers the only pure nordics to be people with blonde hair and blue eyes so why did people like teddy roosevelt brunett endorse it grant s book just lacks any spirit i ve read chamberlain s foundations of the nineteenth century and anyone who is of celtic teutonic or slavic stock and is anti semitic will be riled up with the romaticism of the germanic race being in constant battle with the jews for survival anyone who has celtic scandinavian german anglo saxon polish or baltic ancestry is included in this germanic race while grant tends to alienate anyone who isn t a blonde blue eyed anglo saxon or swede even putting the germans down as inferior this book should also be compared to stoddard s the rising tide of color which was written four years later stoddard also went by the nordic alpinemediterranean model but focused less on this than on the white race as a whole stoddard was a visionary looking to white issue in the future while grant clamored about keeping non nordic russians and italians out of the country stoddard warned that the real dangers are non white asians and negroes grant s book has little relevance to today s issues as practically every white american is a german irishpolishitalian mix stoddard however saw that all whites had to band together against the rising tide of color 
an interesting something someone should really recommend a dictionary in addition to this book words like dearth didactically enantiomorph cancan croon corporeal koan cachet and largess just to name a few are completely unnecessary rewrite this book in english and i may just take another look at it from the small bit i was able to understand through this screen of nonsense there is only a minimal amount of real content to be gained takarazuka is a fascinating aspect of japanese culture and i was greatly disappointed by this book the author s first mistake seems to have been to take on too big of a task the chapters do not connect with each other and there is a general failure to trace various aspects of the theatre either from or two underlying japanese cultural ideas a simple way to start such an investigation would be to write about which roles the female audience identifies with is it the otokoyaku men played by women who caresses the happy blonde haired female or do they imagine themselves as the women who are seduced on stage by the otokoyaku does it matter which they identify with answers to questions even as simple as this one are never addressed in the text the whole time i read this book i felt as though the author was just trying to disguise the fact that she really doesn t have anything at all important to say even after a decade of research if you re linguistically inclined you may want to give it a try but it doesn t seem likely that there s much of importance here 
this book listed for is not hardcover as noted it is listed incorrectly as a hardcover when it s not the book itself is wonderful 
worthless for word if you just want to switch from vb to c and are looking for a good how to reference this is not the book for you especially as it pertains to microsoft word there is a solid description and how to for the range object but that s about it word s bulleted numbered list object arguably the most convoluted of them all doesn t even get mentioned and tables are glossed over in barely pages 
not at all colorful or fun to read for parents or students we have this book in fact we have had it for six years and have never used it i have tried but it is too boring to use poetry should be colorful and beautiful not page after page of poetic text to read i suggest getting some classic poetry books full of color and pictures and reading the beautiful words to your children this book is one to skip

how to start and manage a coin operated laundries business this poorly bound poorly written book is practically stealing from people who buy it it is a pre fab mess there is very little information that pertains to the business avoid it 
the most boring book i read in a really interesting class getting married in korea was one of the books my cultural antro professor mandated us to read the book is excruciatingly boring unlike his other reading assignments i couldnt see myself pass the first chapter or even the first page fortunately i finished the book in a month woohooo the content was in detail and the book with only few graphics i thought it could have been better if the author stuck more pictures in their to at least entertain the reader while reading 
horrible book the only great thing about this book is its small size and thats about it the text doesn t do a very good job of explaining the ideas and concepts say you are given certain parts of an equation it doesn t really show you how to use to components to solve for the right number instead it gives you a wonderful general overview of an idea that is minimal in explanation i m almost at the point of flipping out because the lack of explanations and i m only on chapter 
convoluted but almost generic clive cussler made his reputation writing books with plots that are barely believable using characters that are totally unbelievable saving the world over and over again from his perch in an unknown but extremely powerful u s government agency after many successful books clive perfected the formula and is now sharing it with paul kemprecos who co writes an analogous series which uses the same agency plots and characters oh this series does change some things the main character is kurt not dirk and his sidekick is mexican and not italian also there is a second pack of characters paul and gamay trout who allow the plot to develop through a second set of eyes none of which takes away from the formulaic tone of this series and this book in particular in typical fashion the first chapter is a historical look that sets the stage in this case it is an aerial combat over the alps in between an industrialist and six combat pilots needless to say the industrialist holds his own and manages to down four of his foes before he himself is shot down and killed the next chapter comes to the present time and takes off a second thread this time it is a survivortype of reality show which is interrupted by an attack of some mutated beings the third chapter starts pulling all these disparate threads together and off we go unfortunately this book is too formulaic it does not take the reader long to realize who the threat is nor does it take us long to see the connections between the various threads the only real complication is a completely preposterous connection between the bad guy s attempt to take over the world and an infestation of some new kind of sea weed that tries to take over the oceans as is usual in these novels there are high speed car chases underwater action aerial acrobatics in world war vintage planes no less ! underwater escapades and explosion galore throughout them all the hero gets a bit bruised but the thugs all manage to get killed even though they are supposedly highly trained special forces types and the world is rescued by the effort of one man kurt austin there is a love interest why a different one in each book doesn t he ever get to enjoy some time with his rescued conquest who is french and side visits to scotland and massachusetts the only unique thing about this book was that it was the first time that i was exposed to the premium format which is a slightly longer taller book with more space between the lines the book cover states that this format is specially designed for comfortable reading but i cannot say that it improved things for me that much to summarize as a clive cussler fan i had to read this book to make sure i keep up with the adventures but this one is not in the top two thirds of his efforts i am sure that kurt austin will reappear soon and hope that the next one will be more interesting and fun to read 
too much ego for someone who has spent so much time ostensibly obliterating his ego pinchbeck uses the words i me and mine with surprising frequency breaking open the head was a brave and well told story and pinchbeck does have great skill at telling the tales of his own adventures down the rabbit hole he is at his best a journalist with a skill for wrapping his own experience into fascinating questions but is a disorganized rambling repeat of many of the delightful breaking open tales with some vague and poor attempts at analyzing and synthesizing scholarly information about the upcoming apocalypse mysticism crop circles and psychedelics left me with the nagging slightly sticky feeling that pinchbeck was not a wide eyed explorer of consciousness but rather a rich manhattan art world brat his description of walking around berlin in the rain is particularly indicative who left his wife and daughter in pursuit of the end of the world party complete with as much free sex and intoxication as he could afford rock star or mystic free thinker or man trapped by his own pursuit of what is cool after bushwacking through the crop circle revelations and the mysteries of the modern calendar settles upon and rediscovers or discovers as pinchbeck seems to believe the complex world of non monogamy he declares that the polyamorists among us are more emotionally evolved and free and uses this thin tired excuse to treat women with great disrespect one wonders if the feminine principle pinchbeck claims to value includes women over mothers and women who choose celibacy as a spiritual pursuit pinchbeck pays a great deal of lip service to the necessity of compassion and community but all his stories are about skipping from country to country enjoying himself at burning man exploring the jungles of priestesses and princesses all quite selfish pursuits if his compassion is so great why doesn t he write about his volunteer work with the poor the hungry the disabled the unhip unwashed masses i finished the book realizing that it doesn t make as good or salable a story to spend your time with those members of your community that pinchbeck s fans would much rather read about the heartfelt wacky hijinks of the man who would be terrence mckenna leave yourself entertained and intruigued by breaking open the head and forget the ego of 
aes sedai are sooo boring the first chapter was awesome lan gearing up for a battle there s suspense there s a promise of action i was excited to read more i m halfway through the book now and it s been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters what is robert jordan s problem why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females i don t understand why i still read this author 
not impressive i have to strongly disagree with the editorial and reader reviews on this essay even though it was a national bestseller the book is touted as possibly the most rational description of a descent into morbid clinical depression and suicidal despair i didn t find it so styron was descriptive but rather than probing and baring the depths of his mind and emotions during his depression i felt he only hinted at the tip of the iceberg i didn t find any riveting palpable tracing of his depression it was rather moribund for a subject with such potential there is a detachment throughout that many attribute to styron s calculating dismantling of his own emotions to throw light into the abyss i found the detachment sort of hovering over the pond unwilling to dive in which robs the reader candor yes in some aspects precision somewhat missing he quotes dante in the middle of the journey of our life i found myself in a dark wood for i had lost the right path styron was in the melancholia described by dante but he never succeeds at identifying why or even how he managed to eventually recover from what most reviewers have said this book should have been the definitive treatise on deep depression written by a survivor it is not that impressive at all 
several important points but de soto oversells and is mind numbingly repetitive de soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights it s incredibly difficult for poor people specifically recent urban migrants to get legal title to their land as a result the poor make extralegal arrangements squatting on and using land that neighbors but not the government recognize as theirs but because they don t own the land they can t get a mortgage on their house to start a business electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services the government has difficulty taxing them because they don t have a legal address and so on and so on its a very important point but de soto oversells arguing with exaggerated and oft repeated ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor he occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work for example he has helped businesses in peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes a useful bit of empirical information but those gems appear all too occasionally before reading this entire book i recommend going to the website of de soto s foundation the institute for liberty and democracy at www ildorgpe and reading the main point there in one tenth the words 
sappho would ve leapt after reading this that s what this book should have been titled erica jong is indeed an incredible writer but not here not even close her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer i seriously doubt that sappho wherever she may now be finds it entertaining or edifying to know that erica jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan if sex and the city were still spewing out new episodes perhaps ms jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring sappho as a dildo salesperson and carrie bradshaw as her devoted dildo loving customer feminism is not about having to use scary words like dildo and to prove how much of a woman you are it s about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone ever 
ideological claptrap as a professional art historian who teaches twentieth century art at public university i find this book to be virtually worthless not only do the authors leave out artists from their book because they don t adhere to their own rigid ideological orthodoxies but the book is very badly written they undermine their own arguments by constantly lapsing into semi meaningless jargon a good postmodernist marxist perspective in a general introduction to twentieth century would be useful but these authors are too inept and arrogant to bring it off 
the low gi diet cookbook simple i did not like most of the recepies that were in the book they were too exotic for me a couple of the desert recepies were ok and i did like the color pages that showed the food 
you might want to choose a different anthology this anthology will serve those who don t care about the information that footnotes would provide and those who already have that information in thier heads for students who want to give swift a serious and informed reading this edition is not ideal footnotes are few and there s little editorial help in navigating the complex historical political and religious issues relevant to the text without an understanding of those issues the many of the works included are largely unintelligable and therefore a lot less interesting for the price of a norton one expects a bit more padding to come with the text 
something to read on the can otherwise skip it i have several dozen books on various aspects of success and failure and this book is the most mediocre of them all each page has about words at best and there is no detail to any of the stories of the effort and perseverance required to actually succeed so some slightly famous someone you have heard about had a bad day once big deal there is no lesson to that the real lesson is in reading about the depth and breadth it really takes to succeed real commitment not just a simple piece of good or bad luck if you have a friend who just doesn t like to read at all this would be a suitable gift i m not saying that to be a book snob we have all been in their houses where the heck are the books if you have a friend or relative who is trying to achieve something great in his or her life but they are just not the type to read then this book would be an acceptable choice my younger brother whom i admire a great deal is trying to succeed at a very difficult career path and i will be getting this book for him for his christmas present however if you want anything more than the most superficial read choose a different book 
nudge nudge wink wink david laskin among the intellos david laskin s journalistic and scatter shot approach to this group of significant american intellectuals is disappointing the emphasis is on anecdotes rather than motives psychology ideas or works created the book is lightly documented and if you already know anything about the individual writers or the movements they were part of you ll look in vain for new insights it s certainly readable but because it treats the subjects with so little context the reader wonders after a bit why one should care about these folk who sound more like a bunch of dysfunctional celebrities of the nineties than the defining minds of a complex and fascinating historical era 
disappointing general common sense advice on confidence and self improvement but nothing very specific or useful there are other books much more helpful if one wants to learn how to approach and attract women 
disappointing i can t believe this book was written by the same author as like water for chocolate that book was brilliant this one starts off promising but soon falls flat on its face 
delayed and disappointed the product arrived after the estimated arrival date it took over weeks for my book to arrive the book itself was also not in as good of a condition as mentioned in the description 
go to bayecom and scroll to the training article on power factor training yes you can use more weight in positions of leverage advantage not because you re working more muscle but because of your limbs positioning relative to gravity when you finish a set of full range leg presses for example you almost surely have strength left to do much more work in your somewhat straight legged position does this mean that you should not work the weaker bend legged position at all as this book claims no first of all working the weak range to exhaustion is as effective as working the strong range its how hard you work that matters in either case second with the huge majority of people the range you work is the only range that shows improvement i know the author disagrees he lies third this almost isometric style effects the central nervous system more than tissue if you only need strength in this one range and don t want to change your appearance much fine but there s a problem even with that strength built without building tissue needs more maintenance than strength built along with muscle and is so specific to the mode of development as to be virtually useless in any other activity except the exercise that developed it ! if you want to make proper use of this principle try this first work full range reps until failure then and only then have the bar or machine arm assisted into strong range and do a second set this method requires much recuperation and should only be done with one exercise in a session actually it s rarely needed at all but certainly more valid than power factor the funny thing about power factor claims is that if they want to mislead people with exercise principles they haven t even chosen the most severe principle you can lower more weight than you can hold the best single way to develop strength is to have a weight so heavy that you can t even hold it up ! assisted into the finished position and attempt to slow it s fall as much as possible sure it s crazy dangerous and unnecessary but it works and it s full range 
witty but devoid of content in the midst of life i felt the need to look for a little guidance in the gentlemanly this book delivered very very little truly helpful information i imagine i could have produced a book like this back in the day with plenty of alcohol on board and witty friends around the keyboard it s cleverly written and modestly entertaining but really not at all what i was looking for if however you do need to know the gentlemans take on smoking pot threesomes and carrying a flask this may be your book 
so bad it should never have been published i m really very surprised that anyone liked this book at all how could anyone who likes salinger s writing stand reading alexander s terrible prose it is really painful and that s just the starting point as others on this page have mentioned the author has little or no understanding of salinger s work the example of his misunderstanding the story quotteddyquot is a particularly good example but the book is strewn with them worse the author isn t just ignorant but actually hostile to salinger it s hard to understand why someone would take the time to write a book about someone he clearly dislikes if you must read this book out of curiousity get it at the library i felt really ripped off after buying this book and wished i had not given a nickle to this creepy author and if you are not familiar with salinger by all means do not read this book read salinger your own speculation about the guy based on his fiction will make more sense that this so called biography 
horrible if you must read this book get it at the library don t waste your hard earned cash on this boring to be continued rag i cared absolutely nothing about the characters the attacks on the usa while interesting and plausible were never resolved when the ending mercifully came you could not imagine the look on my face absolutely dumbfounded that weber would end it that way at least now i know never to take a flyer on him again 
needs a more clear diet section this was not worth buying i have read on hypothyroid and this is not the book i was looking for as to help me to speed up my metabolism i would like to find a book that just is plain and gives examples of diets and foods to eat disappointed 
a big let down i was very disappointed by this novel roth is a talented writer and i had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea however the novel just didn t work for me the characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior the plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable read something else by roth i think you ll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this 
hatred begets hatred i e reap what you sow phyllis chesler shares what she perceives as an alarming new trend among leftwing groups however the groups that merit alarm for becoming newly or in reality more visibly anti semitic have always relied on antagonism and violence for motivation workers should hate their bosses women should hate men blacks should hate whites etc we re not talking about hatred in the abstract but deep bred hatred that calls for action strife and turmoil someone please correct me but it sounds as though the author was all for the movement as long as the hatreds were directed the way she prefers now that the beast has unleashed a little fury towards her group she doesn t appear to have second thoughts about the worthiness of her causes but rather she sounds as though she wishes that she could direct the hate back to where she would prefer it to go also i found the writing extremely flawed in many places and there don t appear to be references to back up all the allegations of terrorism i e many acts appear to be random criminal violence that just happened to involve jews my sympathies to those people but all of us are faced with such incidents 
not well researched and partisan this may be the worst book i ve ever finished i was expecting a book that would offer small tidbits of funny information some shots and some glorious facts about the great men who have led our country over the various centuries instead we are treated to a salacious compendium of president s peeing on secret service men and other president s blaming secret service men for farting if you are looking for the man show version of the presidents then by all means fork over your hard earned dollars we are informed that every republican from ike to bush were bumbling idiots and every democrat from fdr to clinton were mere victims of circumstance if you are looking for a michael moore or al franken version of the historical lives of some of the greatest men who ever lived then by all means add to cart thanks to this author s portrayal of u s presidents i will forever read an author s portrayal of the two most divisive presidents of our time nixon and clinton before i make such a purchase again nixon and clinton were both failures in their own right nixon and clinton were both men blessed with an overwhelming amount of potential but they both flushed it away with their individual incidents o brien ends each portrayal with an accurate summary of the unfortunate end of each of the individual tenure but it is within the body of these portrayals that o brien lends his creative writing skills to the eventual manipulation of the reader examples to the point newt gingrich is snide and rapacious and kenneth starr is a ruthless republican bloodhound do we really need these adjectives we read no such adjectives to describe the behaivor of the democrats in power during nixon s term we see no adjectives or adverbs to describe the activities of a woodward and bernstein i would consider it silly for a compendium of this sort to glorify the presidency of nixon for his tenure was not one to emulate nixon and clinton had their otherwise promising presidencies brought down by silly incidents that would ve been seen as such were it not for the cover ups that followed o brien goes onto to proclaim bob jones university as preposterously conservative he declares the great society as a legislative success it maybe true that the great society was a success in accumulating enough votes for passage but can the great society be considered a success in an historical perspective he portrays the anti american carter as the greatest living former president in recent memory he mentions carter s farcical nobel peace prize as testament to this fact what is this everyone knows that that prize was a joke provided by the nobel people looking to make an anti american statement it should be noted that the great peace activist yasser arafat also won this award o brien fails to mention the johnson administration s propaganda involving the gulf of tonkin incident that johnson used to convince american s that america s role needed to be escalated in vietnam it was an incident historians are now claiming never happened but this isn t used to define johnson s administration he maintains that every republican since ford gained office with shenanigans and slick marketing he ends the book with the moore franken style rants against the george w bush election which many nonpartisan publications including the democrat miami herald and the usa today are saying they could ve recounted until the end of time and bush would ve won he comments on bush s slick maneuvering to enter into the war with iraq i will grant you that this book was written before news of the the oil for food un scandals broke these scandals involved france germany and russia and this scandal may have affected the manner in which pre war activities were conducted all in all shouldn t a book of this variety be written to open debate rather than close it with propaganda material i found some of the portrayals of presidents one rarely hears mentioned such as zachary taylor and franklin pierce but i found myself reevaluating all of these portrayals after reading about those with which i am much more familiar i am currently an unsuccessful author but i have written enough and studied the craft enough to know a writer s manipulation when i see it it s a shame too for this could ve been such an interesting idea as i have mentioned cormac o brien has taught me a valuable lesson when buying historical perspectives try and learn the author s agenda before buying his book i have read a couple of books of this sort that will lambaste and glorify an lbj or a clinton as often as they lambaste and glorify a nixon or a reagan while i will agree that it is difficult for an individual to separate himself from his perspective it should always be the responsibility of said author to keep this to a matter of degrees it is my hope that the anxious readers who share my love for information regardless of their individual biases will search elsewhere 
disappointed the original works of james strong are excellent however in the case of some of these newer books where dr strong s work has been corrected are not so good corrected means shot full of errors for example i understand that many believe in the rapture however the word rapture does not exist in the bible it is a work of man i was so disappointed to see references to rapture in a bible dictionary because belief in the rapture alters the entire understanding of the new testament if i were given the option i would have given it a 
a disappointment i have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time i couldn t force myself to get to the end continually i turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn t the way she moves the point of view from katharine back to the story is not enjoyable i would hate not to enjoy philippa gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
very disappointing we were recommended this book by our pastor as a part of our reading for premarital counseling while it does contain good information on the basics of male female anatomy the helpful part stops there the lahayes perpetuate all sorts of gender stereotypes one sided arguments and just plain odd understandings of scripture my husband and i were both offended by the way that this book characterizes women as delicate creatures who need to know nothing about sex save for the needs of their husbands we were angered by the lahayes argument supposedly based on scripture that all couples should want and attempt to have children while children are indeed a blessing to many couples it seems simplistic and unrealistic to assume that all couples should have upwards of five children while we ve both slogged through this book in hopes of learning as much as we can it s been a disappointing process while this book may be an interesting look at the conservative church s views on sex as of i certainly wouldn t recommend it to anyone looking for a helpful encouraging introduction to married sex 
the writing almost ruined the story i d suggest that ralph helfer hire a professional writer to get him through the next account of his interaction with exotic animals although i m an avid animal lover enjoyed the unique perspective and experience related in mr helfer s story i d be hard pressed to say that it wasn t difficult to wade through the sometimes smarmy liberace style of writing that detracted from the essence of his message had zamba been a literary critic he d have turned on helfer before he was a year old 
in hindsight nearing completion of my first semester of law school i can say that the gross majority of advice in this book was totally incorrect it was actually detrimental to me to read this book 
poorly written and boring the most boring business book i have read after pages i have yet to gain any nuggets and am disappointed with the poor standard of writing not only does mr cooper fail to provide actual step by step examples where his process has been followed successfully quoted statistics are unhelpful and are clearly provided solely to support his case one extract from the book page tells all we find the average success rate of developed products to be about but averages often fail to tell the whole story this success rate varies from a low of to a high of depending on the company ! i don t think one has to read a book to know that statistic much of what cooper writes is common sense and i believe of little value to a dynamic organisation wishing to promote the internal development of breakthrough products and their succesful launch thereafter i cannot believe that there are not better books available on this subject 
misleading generalized and distorted these authors take the reader through a journey in time as well as history to set a foundation for the use of permanent magnets included are case studies testimonials wild assumptions and generalities this reader felt like he was being conned by a very poor salesman some of the information may have been correct in it s original context however the authors chose to present only part of the information in a general format and discount other research which may have contrary information this is a scary book it has been a major seller and propaganda machine for companies and individuals to promote sales of magnetic products at the risk of the individual this book has provided two sets of information for this reader first is that medical degrees and bibliographical citations do not always make a credible book second is this book provides a list of possible references with actual research information i do not feel that all of the information contained in this book is wrong just misleading incomplete and distorted a more complete analysis with both indications and contraindications for use can be found in quotmagnetism and its effects on the living system quot by davis and rawls 
too skimpy to be useful this is effectively a foldout brochure laminated with only a few animals birds and very little information you can get almost as much information from your general guide book for costa rica i could only recommend this as something to give children to look at to keep them busy during the trip 
just ok i gave this stars b c i liked the author but the story itself did not appeal to me i found i couldn t identify with ali at all i thought her decisions and her actions were horrible this is just my opinion obviously and again i liked the writing style of carol matthews but i was glad to be done with the story when i got to the last page 
too many typos i m surprised that the previous review did not comment on the number of typographical errors as far as i can see there is only one edition the typos range from the merely distracting to places where sentences become gibberish based on content i d give this at least stars but i found it too difficult to read it s a nice complement to goedels proof by nagel and newman n n give a much clearer exposition of goedel s work but hintikka brings up a number of points i have not seen elsewhere warning many of the points raised can t be fully understood without referring to other works that treat them in more depth unless you already have a strong background in mathematical foundations and logic 
movie is better i swear that this book i awfull i wasn t much of a fan for the first book but this was horribale and more confusing i think thomas harris could ve done better if you liked this book check out the movie soundtrack the silince of the lambs red dragon also by thomas harris 
one side of the story this book was published by brookings as part of a pair the other being unseen wealthlev s book comprised his view whereas unseen wealth included about views including lev slev is primarily concerned with helping the accounting industry fill its black hole intangibles being the difference between market value and the tangibles that the years rules of tangible accounting prescribe for formerly this blackhole was also known as goodwill the trouble is as the service and globally locally networked economies compounded over the last quarter century goodwill or transparent trustflows of an organisation mapped in flows of productivities and demands and across to partnering organisations became the larger dynamic explaining how most value compounds both finacially and in human terms like learning community social progress that take more than days to invest in and may have diverse views of development i dont find in lev s book any answers to such issues as how to resolve the wicked assumptions that all tangible accounting revolve round these include people are costs only machines are investmentsseparate units separate day periods rather than want to map how they interact and compound in non lonear wayswhat is really needed for tracking strategizing transparently governing leading developing intangibles and human relationships is an opposite type of maths that value multiplies instead of separating out bottom lines as if everything in teh world adds up perfectly in days periods whilst unseen wealth is clear about the magnitude of the intangibles crisis lev is not so clear however his work is the middleground and epicentre if you are looking at intangibles only from the perspective of what to do if you are intent on perpetuating the traditional accounting profession as nearly as possible as is 
missed the point sorry guys but this is a very poorly written book it has a tendency to bounce all over the place and leaves the reader wondering what point are they trying to make it also discusses neanderthal technology haven t these guys heard of the quotthree step method quot or quotcontrol point theory quot i think if i were wanting information about how to quotmanufacture at warp speed quot i would think they should at least know how to get to warp speed this books doesn t have the answers it missed the point 
padded padded padded dr gullo has quite a few good ideas here my problem is most of them are already in thin tastes better and the book is blatantly padded which drives me nuts the useful material could be condensed down to about pages so to make the book long enough he repeats every idea about times he mentions the gg bran crispbread on literally every page which brings me to annoyance as other reviewers have suggested most of his recommended foods are nearly impossible to find absolutely no one in my area carries the bran crispbread i finally mail ordered some only to discover that it s barely edible it tastes like thin sheets of wood it s bearable if topped with something but really awful eaten plain take my advice and forget about it just get yourself some ry krisp finn crisp or even reduced fat triscuits my staple i finally found fage yogurt and it s very expensive for an individual oz cup and it s only available in either fat free which i don t like or very high fat calories per oz i did find walden farms salad dressings but when i saw that they re labeled calorie free i decided they would probably be vile tasting and put them back on the shelf i also found vitamuffins but if you read the ingredient lists they are not particularly healthy the top three ingredients in their cranbran muffins are water sugar and white flour ! bran is way down the list and the fiber content is not high so i didn t buy those either i was glad to know that alba shakes are still being made although again you have to mail order them dr g does have good behavior modification suggestions i think he s absolutely on the money about trigger foods and always carrying a snack pack with you but again i believe all of that is in thin tastes better 
don t be misled the title of this book is c all inone desk reference for dummies however after reading this book it is quite obviously aimed at users of microsoft products on microsft systems c is a multi system language and any book calling itself a c all inone desk reference should be demonstrating the language in a pure form such as the excellent c all inone desk reference for dummies book by dan gookin this book either needs to be rewritten to accurately reflect the title or the title needs to be changed to accurately reflect the content maybe c on microsoft all inone desk reference for dummies if you need to learn c in a pure form then find another title 
it was so so i found the book had some ideas that helped but it was unrealistic in many ways i am spiritual but i didn t appreciate the religious opinion it gave

no solos if you are trying to learn the solos of the first four iron maiden albums st killers number of the beast and piece of mind this is not the book for you this book only has the rhythm guitar 
so what i barely got through this book and i love this genre two things kept annoying me in this book it was poorly edited and poorly written for a reader a little humility from the author goes a long way we are naturally rooting for the author and will forgive and overlook many things until it is just too annoying we are seeking reasons to cheer on our protagonist and like her muleady mecham did provide some reasons but too frequently i got turned off in the next paragraph when she bragged about how good she or her team was over and over it was about what a star she was and how great she was on one page she started consecutive sentences with i i did this i did that i did this i did that very timesome reading i found only of her stories to be interesting the rest were boring stories that read like a journal she wrote as a christmas present for her parents they were so unexciting that only her family and friends could have enjoyed them for example one story was about how she worked excessive hours another story was about being involved in a fire she only saw it and called it in arresting someone driving someone to jail and getting shot at all in one night none of the incidents was terribly exciting but since it all happened one night she was very impressed with herself for me like many of her stories i thought so what 
can we say gay uh no this book had litle to be desired and its just not cool with all them big words i mean come on whats a sherry and what is an amontdillo i dont even know loserbook go central high footbal 
the three pigs i would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children in this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig when the pigs ask for the materials to build their houses they do not offer to pay trade or work for the straw sticks or bricks they are given the materials what kind of message does that give our youth 
truly awful book for discussing so many nobodies the part about the plain soldiers of the revolutionary war being dealt with so much in detail is boring and tedious better to have written about the founding fathers of the us army who were at least colonels in the army s birth 
shallow content overpriced book this book has a very shallow content and is only a glorified feature listing of web analytics product features with no in depth details at all what makes it worse is it is highly overpriced for what shallow content it offers this information can be obtained from the vendors website datasheets also avoid this book 
stay back reading this book was exhausting confusing and extremely unsatisfying sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information some major elements that are introduced are left hanging never brought up again others are revisited ad nauseum barr s quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading although i did stay with it until the contrived end this is the first book i ever attacked with a red pen and edited a i went along i estimate it could have been pages shorter and have carried far more impact without the extraneous language i am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books i d stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic p d james or a pure and simple sue grafton 
what happened what happened magic tree house series books were great with educational tales filled with historical relevance that used just enough magic to make the story work buy the complete set of however the christmas book and apparently all the following books are pure magic fantasy drivel with no redeeming qualities did mary pope osborne hope to capitalize on the harry potter craze im basing this on heresay since i haven t read harry potter i slogged thru this book cringed and gagged thru and made my wife read the next ones to my year old i m going to tell him there aren t anymore because they are too awful to buy and read i very very disappointed in what happened to this series please please mary pope get back to writing good stories and not this nonsense 
a narcissist s view of in the years since september th many authors have tried their hands at the novel with all of its delicate subject matter and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success jonathan safran foer julia glass wendy wasserstein and others have centered novels on the pre and post era and now claire messud takes her turn with the emperor s children a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day the titular emperor is murray thwaite a prestigious journalist living the quintessential manhattan lifestyle fame money parties and the adoration of literati and socialites alike he has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person his children are the people immediately surrounding him captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness at the novel s onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life s direction first and foremost is marina murray s daughter who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father s reputation the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her it is easy to forget that marina is years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite then there is murray s nephew frederick bootie tubb who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor bootie an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man quickly becomes disillusioned with murray for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be complicating things further is ludovic seeley a smarmy australian businessman who has come to manhattan to start his own magazine and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon lastly there are marina s best friends julius a gay hanger on from chilly michigan eager to make an impression on the new york social scene and danielle who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on but suffers from such ludicrous ally mcbeal esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages the characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying but messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because as shallow as they are they are all multi layered complex believable people the many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies even if you wouldn t necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them but that willingness to stick with their stories is at least for me predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel s end they aren t and while the narrative is expertly crafted messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes increasingly irritating as she uses them to stretch out her sentences and to add separate thoughts or descriptive elements and even occasionally dialogue so that they feel like run ons like this one right here this example i ve devised for you but are for the most part technically grammatically sound even though you may have to re read the most trying sentences a second time just to figure out what she is saying without letting all of her distractions get in the way messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and september th draws near there is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found some directly indicating that september will be a month of great change what with ludovic s magazine set to launch on the th and a wedding to take place but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be the sense of impending disaster looms large in the emperor s children and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes indeed is almost anticlimactic when it occurs serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone s story lines it was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed in the late afternoon of that day after the towers had fallen and manhattan s skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn t a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters all they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars i felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine s launch had to be cancelled i live in the tri state area about an hour and a half away from ground zero and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life and what messud has critically failed to capture is the way that actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand i remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other the phone calls i made to and received from people i hadn t even spoken to in months or even years just to make sure that they were all right i remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out whether the need was great or small this incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world but it is conspicuously absent from messud s telling one character uses the tragedy for personal gain career wise one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity not for anything to do with mind you but for strictly personal reasons i don t want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate i had hoped that tragedy would change the emperor and his children for the better but i was wrong and it s a shame messud is definitely a capable promising writer but this isn t her finest hour 
prescient but dated although i can certainly understand the appeal of this groudbreaking precambrian cyberpunk novel the story and language are hopelessly dated to a modern reader in a way the book reminded me of an ayn rand novel good ideas stuck between pages upon pages of confusing and ridiculous dialog spewed by one dimensional characters 
barron s is bull the book is pretty much useless the one thing that will come in handy is its dictionary the questions are badly written and confusing and the answers don t actually vary very much the reasons given for the answers tend to be little more than saying the author implies repeats multiple choice answer 
this book is very disappointing i was so excited to get this book ! i thought at last new adventures with my favorite characters ! what a disappointment not only is the premise ridiculous but the characters are written as caricatures of themselves joel is only barely recognizable do you really think he would close a letter with quotyours in chutzpah quot would chris end a note with quotsupremely conscious quot please don t hit us over the head with it ! another irritant is the fact that whenever joel maurice or holling sends a letter to a place of business the personal address reads quotgentlemenquot the northern exposure series was always exploring issues of gender with thoughtfulness and insight but this book simply reiterates the cultural undertones of sexism if you re a real northern exposure fan don t waste your time on this book 
not geared for the ccna exam this book is good as a primer if you want consider achieving a ccna this book is not good as a study guide for the exam due to its lack of granularity on most ccna subjects 
awesome book poor size this is one of the best children s books ever written but it is a mini version of the book and was not portrayed as one it is over priced for the product i sent an email regarding my bewilderment to amazon and got no response 
not very practical while the concept of this book makes sense application in the life of a mother doesn t i have four children and can t possibly retrain myself to think only in terms of my stomach basically the author wants you to think about how you sit stand carry your baby cough sneeze lie down get up and that s on top of the daily excercise routine as an added bonus she tells you that one jacknife can undo weeks of work ! i know that at am if one of my children starts crying i don t stop to think about how to properly get out of bed first i m just trying to quiet my child before all of the others are awake too that s too much of a time investment for me to make just to mess it up with one mistake 
worst ending ever i m giving this book stars because it did keep me entertained for a short while then like many other reviewers i began to get bored of all of her complaining and whining but the ending horrible i was left feeling bewildered felt like perhaps my book had some pages left out of it the authors did a very poor job of tying up loose ends what happened to her and hh also she mentions that she needs to find a job using her degree a whole section is even devoted to describing one interview then the only thing you ever here about her job hunting again is a one sentence reply during a dinner party what did we miss something i was extremely disappointed and would encourage you to pass this one up 
outdated edition the seller needs to list the edition he she is selling this is a very out dated edition that was sold to me the seller did not sent any return information like the other agencies did 
many important topics not discussed this is supposed to be a concise book but it sadly does not tackle the most practical aspects that are needed for front linersexample when talk on amputee prefers to talk on amputee gait instead of practical things like how to improve stump how to deal with troubles with doning or doffingexample when talk about sci not even mention let alone discuss very important topics like bowel problems sexual problems these young patients haveexample when talk about pain not even touch upon the topic of centralization let alone discussing how to treat the discussion on crps not up todatepoor buy good alone for junior medical student 
agree with scott tessier this book was assigned in a graduate level international relations class while the aim of the book is laudable to give practical solutions to foreign policy problems the execution leaves much to be desired the editors make each contributing author shoehorn their essays into a rather clumsy outline there are countless no sherlock moments when reading this book overall it is not insightful and an utter waste of time 
read if you must reading this book i find that the author s ego interferes often with the documentation of how america went from haute cuisine to the modern american restaurant one particular passage paints his mother a cook in the same light as elizabeth david and m fkfisher and leaves me wondering why if she was so enlightened do i not see her book on the shelf throughout the book he comes off as an average cook that could no longer take the heat and left the kitchen to write with about pages left to go i cringe each time i reach for the book to attempt to finish it as what the author must perceive as colorful writing becomes more laborious with each page that said there is definitely some interesting information and if you can indeed labor through some of its issues and weave around the author s bias you will be somewhat rewarded i especially found some of the la pavillion information interesting after finishing jacques pepin s autobiography bottom line if you are seriously interested in reading about american gastronomy this might we worth a look if you can pick a copy up cheap i only wish someone with more skill had taken on the project as it was in fact an excellent idea for a book 
anti american propaganda shooting people is a small thesis on how america exported reality tv to europe and gave them bad habits it blames the us for everything the last time i checked we never forced europe to watch television 
all i can say i ve given up on dickey this book wasn t good at all and i gave an extra star nothing like his first books and i know he can write better i m afraid to even read another after this one and drive me crazy which wasn t much better to me 
i was bored of the silent i feel i must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless suspenseless bore being a fan of all things egypt and an agatha christie fan as well i thought this book would be sure to please not so ! short of grisham i ve never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful charming intelligent desirable and perfect in any way and so boring was this a mystery i don t remember much of a plot at all just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts finally why set it in egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country its people other than a few trite stereotypes and its antiquities reading it on a long plane flight i actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable for my guilty pleasure i ll go back to stephen king tolstoy by comparison 
a plush book in every sense of the word what you get for your money a pastel colored book with a soft plush cover some watercolor sketches with text on top of them and a photo of mr dyer s smiling face on the back it makes for nice decoration but it doesn t make for serious reading the secrets are little poetic statements that you ve heard before in lifes little instruction book among other places from mr dyer s talks its clear he knows a lot about inner peace too bad he s more interested in packaging it and selling it for profit than teaching it theres also a bit of a feeling like he s trying to indoctrinate you into something 
trash book and the trash networks it covers if you can read something that looks like it was written by a five year old child as well as not get sick to your stomach on all the trash it covers this only confirms that the networks are only interested in money not program content 
i keep trying but can t despite all the negative publicity and my insistence that i wouldn t buy anymore of these books i did my new rule ended up being that i would wait for the paperbacks so with book due in pb this fall i decided to give this book another try you see a couple years ago when it came out in paperback i tried to read it i couldn t my friends told me just to read the last chapter and skip the rest i started reading anyway i put it down it is so boring filled with so many people who i ve never heard of and lacking the best elements of the series rand v forsaken that i couldn t do it well here i am again and i still can t read it and now i hear that book will end the entire series so we have a great first books where tons of cool thing occur a terrible next books where nothing occurs and then an ending where everything stops just like that i now recommend that people read the first three books in the series and no more tdr is a good stopping place although there s good stuff in books they require a reader to want more book wraps it nicely just pretend ishamael was the dark one and you re all done what a tragedy to have created something so great and ruined it so thoroughly 
where did ja jance go i own and have read all of ja jance s jp beaumont and joanna brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character s lives i picked this book up thinking it would be on par with all the ja jance books i ve read previously what a crashing disappointment i can t care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations truth be told i kept looking at the cover to see if i d picked up a harlequin by mistake i ll probably read more ali reynolds books if this is indeed a new series but i d much rather see what happens with jp and joanna incidentally i didn t think much of either of them either when their paths crossed some books ago this one gets a big aw c mon ja you can do much better than this from me for those who haven t read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first jaj get the jp beaumonts and start at the beginning they are worth the time and effort 
i was duped ok people here s some advice before you think about buying this book don t just look at all the and star customer reviews rank the customer review list from lowest rank first and read all the star reviews as well that way you can really get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into sure in both the high reviews and the low reviews there s just basic no brainer reviews its great or its sucks but amongst all the one star reviews i discovered some smart punters whom i should have read before buying the damn book myself yup i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews i realise that some reviewers had duly warned me this book is terrible it gives only the scantiest of basics on body language stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write and the photos my god ! its mr steele with his wife and their friends posing away in their garish shirts and shorts these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for flirting and body language i ve ever ever seen and in his blurb photo at the front of the book he s standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest there s something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that i find highly disturbing yucko as others have said if i could give this book a zero star rating i would avoid everyone avoid like the plague 
this is a rehash of the cmmi v document as the lead in implementing cmmi within my organization i was very disappointed in the contents of this book it is simply a rehash of the information in the cmmi seswippdss v that is available for free on the cmmi website i found no wisdom from the authors on how to actually implement the processes and be successful with an assessment the included cd simply includes the incomplete tables and checklists that are included as appendices and make up about half of the book by the way my recommendation is to save you money and read the cmmi documents 
this was ok i know there are many different jewish beliefs and approaches i am not jewish the author makes an honest amp straitforward approach a decent read 
welcome back my friends to the show that never ends when will it end never ! muwhahahahaha ! review contains spoilers first off up until this point i found the series moderately entertaining especially the nd book granted in every book there are certain aspects of jordan s redundant writing that are very annoying for instance the childish and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters realistically in a time period like that if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series they would get a good thumping and be forced to learn from their mistakes as would anyone really instead the men grovel like slaves around the women it s very annoying and infinitely un realistic even in fantasy there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational practical decision there is hardly any logic here and when someone who is supposedly wise speaks up its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should and probably does know most of the so called intellectual sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a year old kid would know human characteristics aside jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery clothing geography battle fields etc hardly anything is left out i suppose this is good if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that jordan has created but here we are at the th book i hate to say it but not enough happened in the time line to justify long books sometimes it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books this can either be as an excuse for such a long series or its just basically poor writing i m a little undecided on that this book is full of the usual aspects that the previous had most of the men can t think for themselves however there are a number of characters that i do like allot uno julian matt asmodean lan thom loial who isn t even in this one go figure what happened to elays uhg the female characters whine and complain like my year old daughter rand s increase in the one power is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into it all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the dragon reborn end of book i believe it takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up and take action this is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series rand attains the sword that cannot be touched a weapon that can level cities what does he do shoves it into the floor at the stone of tear and scampers off into the woods for another adventure wow smart huh the forsaken are scheming as usual it s a mystery to me that they were picked by the dark one powerful as they may be they re mostly stupid too paranoid and un trustworthy of one another it would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate rand they could everyone knows they could but they don tfrustration level ever increasing this series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time then shove them off with hardly a word of goodbye something that i must point out is the way jordan decides to kill off or deal with the evil characters this whole re incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance and fear of death i believe it is wrong to kill off so many evil characters at one time characters that have potential are eliminated and yes asmodean here comes my biggest gripe of all i rather liked asmodean his character was interesting and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the evil side to good side even if it was un willinglyhe does provide a lot of insight for rand if i was a forsaken i would defiantly cross over to rand s side it only makes sense but instead of keeping asmodean alive and allowing him to help rand with his great struggle hes killed off at the end of the book right there jordan drops a huge amount of story potential and trades it for the same un inventive one sided drivel that the rest of this book contains then rand goes on to kill rhavin another interesting character wasted lanfear has also been killed as far as we know again another interesting character wasted i could care less about moraine after the first book her character is basically rendered useless and is completely unneeded all in all jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters hurin ingtar elays etc and keep the boring immature ones nynaeve egwene elayne aviendha etc the series is simply too long and i m positive it has over pages of material that needs to be discarded if lord of chaos is as bad as this one i m burning my collection and sending the remains to jordan s house so to those who are in the midst of this series like i am i say to you welcome back my friends to the show that never ends 
disappointed i have twin year olds and we travel every chance we get from local treats national parks and campouts to the smithsonian old forts and amusement parks but i found it hard to take this book seriously when disney world is actually not one of the places to take your kids before they grow up but the museo del in prado in spain is recommended for ages and over having been there the paintings although lovely will not hold the attention of a year old unless he was born in a leap year you can add the louvre or borobudur or the huntington library for that matter i have been to of the places in this book many of them worth mentioning for older people i am a fan of educational trips and stops but a little fun is also necessary for the young ones and this book makes it near impossible to actually plan a trip that drifts along from the locations in this book and really disney is the happiest place on earth i swear i don t work for them but ask your kid disney or the hermitage 
christian fundamentalism dramatized even the avid trekie reader of the star trek science fiction novels movies and television series must suspend disbelief when he finds captain kirk saying beam me up scotty but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world wide rapture though the characters and their roles are fictitious the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer the story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass rapture event and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born again conversions in the september october issue of foreign affairs walt mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform billy graham s biography by strober notes that they criticized graham s new evangelism for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the tribulation force or as exemplified by jerry falwell s moral majority they are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the united nations mead notes that it is no coincidence that the left behind novels show the antichrist rising to power as the secretary general of the united nations the u s statistical abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially while evangelicals and liberals e g southern baptists lutherans presbyterians methodists and catholics are continuing their per capita declines such data and the reported popularity of these left behind novels indicate fundamentalism s growing appeal in reaction to contemporary american society i see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the left behind in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern american society and as conservative christians who believe it is better to stay behind and in not just a few respects they may be wise to do so thomas j hickey 
very poor source of dietary information these people have stumbled upon the truth carbs make you fat and contribute to poor health but they cannot wean themselves from years and years of mainstream dietary misinformation so for instance they still publish the quotfood pyramid quot with a base of six servings of carbohydrates they state that a food with a glycemic index of or more is quothighquot that is really high ! yet they recommend graham crackers as a snack for children gi this book is confusing and poorly written 
don t waste your time this book is beyond weak i would like to give it negative stars if possible the characters are confusing and little goes on with them that is worth reading about or believable i suppose if you like fictional sex and rambling writing you will love this book personally i want a refund 
a poorly writen book with many glaring ommissions this is a poorly written book with many glaring ommissions 
hey i ve got a great idea the da vinci code is a worldwide phenomenon staying on the new york times bestseller list for over years i think i ll throw together a quicky book with some alternate intepretations of biblical history that i got from looking up websites with google one weekend i ll slap the name da vinci code in the title of my book and market it to delusional paranoids who spend every waking minute thinking about how the arts and entertainment world is at war with christianity i ll make a forture off someone else s success it sure beats working for a living god bless americ 
not helpful this book looks good only at first sight however try and solve the exercises and you see there is more to var than the author wants us to believe this book is too incoherent to be of any use just take a look at the index a lot of things are introduced but are never used again later in the book this makes me wonder why they were introduced at all some examples from the index hessian garch markov process etc the biggest fault however in my opinion is the treatment of monte carlo the most essential tool for var calculation condensed in roughly pages compared to roughly pages for mathematical preliminaries and probability cannot cater to the same audience 
stereotypical adventure genre this was my first wilbur smith book i thought it was all right for an adventure genre there is enough historical research to add color and it certainly moves along well many of the events are not believable but you can say the same for james bond the book jumps between history and legend easily and superficially boys grow into manhood overnight women fall deeply in love by seeing someone from afar crocodiles are much more aggressive than in real life but it is easy reading for passing a few hours 
disappointing i have read all of the boscastle series and i was thoroughly disappointed in this book i loved the other siblings especially chloe s but this one is dull and uneven the orgy party where devon and jocelyn meet isn t the place that they should have been brought together again i can t fathom how jocelyn would be at this party when she is an innocent ! jocelyn s brother is sort of mentioned but we don t really know him at all nor her father which could have created more depth to her character and would have given devon more insight into his relationship i think it would have been more believeable if jocelyn met devon again while he was portraying the highwayman what was weird is that jocelyn s father just happened to show up in the tower where they were caught when he wasn t at the party previously also along these lines is that the boscastle siblings just appear out of nowhere if i missed how they showed up then it just reinforces my opinion that this book is skim worthy not attention worthy i have learned from reading this author is that the mystery or villian really takes a back seat in her books in a major way usually the plot is wrapped up in a blink and you will miss it way i expected more from this book especially since i loved devon in the other books in the series i hope that the boscastle s continue on with a story on gabriel or charlotte but please make their stories believeable 
the whole rambling mess after the hype on this book i was extremely disappointed at how it rambled along with extraneous detail that never made a cohesive whole i kept at it hoping it would improve but alas dear reader it does not 
this book has an agenda anytime the christian right has a chance to undermine women it will take that chance and run with it please read the myth of gender by fausto sterling your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family the whole point of dobson s book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset male or female with no room for the individual the individual is reality not this sexist nonsense i have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools very insulting 
not worth the money as is sometimes the case the title of this book is somewhat misleading having read several books which were generally favorable to greenspan i thought this one might give a balance counter view overall it turned out to quite a disappointment in the first few pages professor batra made it clear that he thinks he is probably more qualified to be the fed chairman than greenspan on page he says he had not done any path breaking work in economics at least not that was commonly cited on page he says it could explain how he had advanced so far without sufficient credentials how his extraordinary career appeared to derive crucially not from merit but from favoritism and connections also on page greenspan did not even have a ph d at the time nor had he penned anything pioneering to earn the recognition of his peers on page i again knew the book was in trouble when batra stated because in my view intelligence and integrity go together does anyone actually believe that all dishonest people are dumb on page batra made it clear that the book was as much or more about his economic philosophy than it was about greenspan when he wrote in fact i will offer a new economic paradigm to cure the global stagnation that has resulted from tax trade and monetary policies inspired by greenspan he does offer a paradigm unfortunately real world experience shows that the paradigm does not to work as he postulates clearly the book is attempting to put forth his agenda as the rest of the book demonstrates professor batra is a fairly strong liberal in whose world the working poor will spend all additional income and the idle rich will simply put extra income under their mattress he regularly harps on reducing income taxes on the poor and increasing them on the rich and big businesses as recently as the congressional budget office documented that the bottom to of the population pay little or no taxes while the upper income individuals and businesses pay the vast majority how the government could reduce the taxes on people who do not pay taxes is never addressed professor batra does correctly point out that the social security tax is quite regressive in order to discredit greenspan batra gives greenspan gives greenspan far more power than is warranted throughout the book batra tries to convince us that the president and congress did whatever greenspan might suggest or support as written the book makes one believe that batra never watched greenspan testify before congress where the congressmen tried to get greenspan to support their way of thinking basically batra tries to blame greenspan for all of the acts of congress batras new paradigm he calls economic democracy in this economic democracy the federal government would buy most of the stock of the large companies and then give it or sell it at a big discount to the employees of the companies that way the employees would be in control rather than the ceos and boards of directors clearly professor batra is not living in the real world in the real world most of the employees who were given the stock would simply sell it in fairly quick order and that of course would return things to where they originally were for many years i was an employee owner of the nations largest totally employee owned company and i can attest that they do not operate in any way close to what professor batra assumes the good professor needs to get out his ivory tower and get a job in the real world if you want to learn about greenspan this is not the book to read save your money 
imitation scholarship yes rifkin s descriptions of the cultural differences between americans and europeans make interesting reading but the vast majority of what he says is anecdotal if not inaccurate i found it amusing to read his praise of europe s assimilation of immigrants when riots were occurring all over france and the idea that the popularity of subscription services and auto leasing means companies are now in the business of selling time rather than material products is absurd 
a hoot some of these reviews are great some are hilarious and show just how little each gender understands about the other my favorite review is the one that says something like women have more to offer than at any other time they re better educated they make more money and they re more fun to be with than ever before i d love to see the statistical research backing up that last assertion anyway about the book truly all the content could have been packed into one essay the rest is just filler anecdotes that contribute little understanding but for some reason make up the vast majority of these types of books probably because they re really not a whole lot to say on the topic my own experience runs something along the lines of the book i m in law school and i ve noticed that an extremely high number of law school women are very very pretty yet have lots of trouble getting men interested in them looking around it s because these women are extremely masculine they have nice faces and bodies sure but to be a lawyer or other professional one must be directed unemotional focused hard working serious outspoken and aggressive these are all traits that testosterone produces ! and it s true the women in law school are far more like female men than anything else im dating a couple women who have no college degree but who are very feminine and soft and gentle the complete opposites of law school women most of the guys i know in law school are doing the exact same thing therefore i think that these women are having a hard time finding men simply because men see them as other men not as women ! several of the women i know in law school are dating or have married rather effeminate men artists a whale trainer etc these are not the types of men who are the alpha males of the business world the more alpha a male is the more he wants someone who is his complete opposite soft gentle giving unassuming submissive a girly girl the women mentioned in this book aren t girly girls they re man girls who wants that 
it s a comic strip man was i disappointed this book is a comic strip it may have had a lot of meaning to those involved at the time it was written with many government stings hidden in the strip but for enjoyable reading it stunk i got through it in half an hour hardly my idea of buying good reading 
lackluster this book was very easy to read and moved along quickly but it was by no means quotgoodquot the plot was sometimes boring and sometimes just silly and the writing was banal although it was a fast read there are hundreds of other books out there that are a fast read and capitivating reading this book was a waste of my time 
soapy this is a soap opera that either wants to be literature or was marketed as literature it s a romance novel many people over a period of many years fall in love get married have affairs grow up grow old and have children of their own though the characters are scientists their crushes and affairs are no different from any others the book jacket says it s about inner lives of smart people regrets are a large part of their lives though only one or two characters are well drawn enough to be interesting and induce sympathy and they have a terrible habit of not taking action when they can and want to large editing problems render this clearly a first novel though i give it two stars for the apparent effort put into it 
what does the turkey have to do with this mystery i was disappointed in this book i had started getting these books on cd from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few i listened to i enjoy the author s picturesque almost poetic descriptions of things those descriptions were still there but they did not connect well the mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by line not really crucial to the other goings on in the story there is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line i felt very let down at the end of this audio book 
a good story presented in an awkward format although i enjoyed the story itself this deluxe edition really didn t do anything for me the book is x which makes it awkward to handle hard to read and difficult to store fernando duval did the illustrations and are alright at best supposed to be limited to copies the book is autographed by duval but not numbered not that it would make any difference overpriced stick to the regular hardbound edition unless you are into odd sized books 
disgust i would prefer to give this book no stars it is an outdated sexist look at the generalizations of men that no longer apply in today s society i am amazed that this book is a publication it would make better since if it was published in i am years old and wanted to find out why my husband is so different from me in certain aspects this book was useless all it did was offend me disgust me and lead to arguments with my husband it made me feel that i made a bad decision in being heterosexual because i liked nothing about men and their ways my husband read through the book and talked to me about the inaccuracies and made me feel good about men and him again i would not suggest this book to anyone under especially if they are desperately seeking to understand their husband and are dealing with minor marital problems this book will only make things worse among the many irritating statements made my favorite offensive sexist statement is men s arms are built to swing an ax while women s are built to cradle babies give me a break ! someone needs to write a book on this subject that is relative to this day and age women and men do struggle with their differences and it would be so helpful to have an accurate manual to go to for suggestions this is not such a manual 
and yet more elitist filth in print i was recommended borges works by one of his innumerable over educated sycophants and i will never forget the tremendous time i wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life s work when i should have been writing my dissertation each time i read one of his pedantic mediocre peices of short fiction i was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that i would like other examples of his work if i continued reading since quotall of his stories are so unique quot i found the exact opposite to be true one story after another about mazes mirrors mystical mathematical formulas and books books books the ideas were transperant the language boring in the extreme his poetry is trite who needs this borges reads like a petulant graduate student at university of chicago who failed repeatedly to get his her short fiction published in the atlantic monthly particularly among academics literary elites and like people many seem to cite borges and worship his genius more than read him and certaintly no one reads him critically i read most of his work and i can tell you outside of a few interesting turns of phrase you d be better off reading a yale dissertation on the semiotics of self superiority people incessantly talk about how imaginative borges is the vast majority of popular sf and fantasy writers are more imaginative even many of the despicable magical realist quotgeniusesquot make borges look rather plain borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of manhattan or cambridge if you re this kind of pompous fellow you ll want to sleep every night with a portrait of luis by your side and a series of mirrors as it were slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans substantiation with this benighted old librarian if you re the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters enjoying nuanced use of language and grasping subtle daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter run far far away from jorge luis borges even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews the adulation of borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among those who think themselves intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction i think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams and not an example of literary genius in that sense min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work and that s about as much attention as he deserves

the problem with lust in particular to the sexual topic author joshua harris who have scored no pun intended mind you a great hit with his first book on the subject of dating called i kissed dating goodbye spawned a sequel documenting his courtshipping days with his now found wife called boy meets girl this time harris had come up with a third installment on the subject of lust particularly on the aspect of human sexuality eventually the book just went on as being more of a stuff to only propagate organized churches ideals rather than to convey to its readers what its premise supposedly have guaranteed a book to help christians overcome their problems with sexual temptations presenting a certain idea of dependence to the common church communities norms chapters lone rangers are dead rangers although it did affirmed that the key to total deliverance from sinful problems is a sturdy connection with god chapter you can t save yourself which at the same time apparently only show the inconsistencies of what are the currently and commonly accepted prevailing concepts amidst the church circles of our day along with their popular explanation regarding god s salvation that runs like a confusing pretzel logic which only go around in tangled circles proclaiming that being salvation is only attainable by grace one has no real need to obey god and yet they would strain a gnat to follow into their church s system or otherwise condemnation is not too far around to be driveled out into the particular if one wouldn t submit into the dictates of their church s ideals thus unfortunately this book never delivered and in the long run harris stated it so in the book that he has no solution and there is no secret method at all in overcoming the lust problem harris book not even a hint live up to its title under the constriction of being a completely impotent material to help anyone who has a great problem with sexual temptations and not as to dismiss or belittle every person s own strengths and capacities regarding an individual s own area of weaknesses i find it crazy on the author s part to have strong sexual problems when it comes to seeing a copy of lingerie catalogues i mean being that he is a christian and married to his wife which would mean that he loves his wife synonymous to his devotion and commitment with his wife in that respect presumably and in being thus out of his respect for his wife sure enough although its automatic within a male s psyche to have that sexual suggestion in the mind whenever the sight of an insufficiently clad woman comes along he would ve not have a problem at all with that and be tempted to indulge in it or otherwise there is something wrong with his own perspective as a christian and for that matter about his love for his wife and how she really meant to him cause if one is really in love and needless to say devoted out of that condition to his wife he wouldn t have the knack to look lustfully at nor desire any other women at all but his very own wife believe you that ! thus at this point it only gives the idea that harris should ve taken more time in analyzing his own personal condition and learn more about the topic at hand before coming out with this book on the subject the aspect of a person s sexuality is the most private and personal thing that each person possessed as occultist and book writer donald michael kraig wrote on his book modern magick therefore sex is totally involved in our psyches control a person s sex life and you control the person kraig cites that the matter regarding sexuality is the very aspect wherein those who d like to manipulate and control its subjects within a group sect or cult is the very effective means to do so and is indeed used for brainwashing methods it s crazy that in most church communities these days they even control matters of courtship within their members not for the purpose of trying to peeve away many christians that perhaps this little review have done enough already for those who are so up with joshua harris as he s someone who s in the camp of their church s idealisms i think so called church of satan founder anton lavae presented a more better idea regarding the method to solve the problem of sexual urges although i bet that his motives could be moot as far as his sincerity goes under the context that he s on for the fa ade of trying to assert an appearance of some idyllic pretense against the christians and that it s not for the sake of plain earnestness in itself that one could have the means for sexual release or relief through indulging in sexual fantasies without committing to involve anyone upon it such as in example one would masturbate without fantasizing to involve any real person within those fantasies but are such that are consisting only of self created images kinda like in the movie cool world or of a fictionary person visualized for those sex fantasiestherefore under that context not only would the individual be free from the act of fornication but is also not guilty of committing any mental adultery towards another person deliverance from sexual struggles involves one s own personal acceptance understanding and knowledge about his or her own sexuality there are other books and resource materials that are much more helpful than this one by joshua harris that are available out there hence regarding the topic not even a hint scores not an inch of any helpful doze for its readers rather smooch unnecessary church demands goodbye 
read closer for the true picture beyond the influence injects the reader with exhaustive detail the effects of the drug alcohol on the human body and brain in both alcoholics and nonalcoholics a psychologist author and a recovered alcoholic paint a clear picture that alcoholism is a true medical disease rooted in abnormalities in brain chemistry the audience is clearly directed towards teachers who are in treatment clinics page after page it fatigues the reader with information that anyone with intelligence would have knowledge of but never before took the time or forced to understand the steps to take for an intervention to find the right treatment program or how to prevent a future relapse looking at the bigger picture sparks the idea that it is not only a lucrative business in supplying a legal drug as alcohol but writing books or establishing treatment centers to reap the wealth from the victims even more charles darwin in the book on the origin of species by means of natural selection gives the impression that evolution is about the survival of the fittest it makes sense why katherine in chapter four writes that for hundreds even thousands of years people have argued loud and long that alcoholism is a shameful personal weakness a stubborn character defect or a symptom of some underlying moral disorder in a world filled with labels to counter attack chaos and confusion it is very interesting in how life itself operates the world in its natural state rests pure evilness with norms and labels humans put daily pressure upon each other to separate the strong from the weak the effect causes some to fall and when this happens some turn away while others flock like vultures to the weak in order to either reap the wealth or make themselves feel more excepted people wish to be settled only as they are unsettled is there any hope for them thanks to katherine everyone can rest easier knowing that it is not their fault since she does point out that alcoholism is a disease of the body not a weakness of character in the future will we ever see the one million march with flags stating that alcoholism is a disease so therefore its time we started treating it like one the truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable unhappy or unfulfilled for it is only in such moments propelled by our own discomfort that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers with this said maybe the norms and labels that are pushed on newborns from the time being born do serve a purpose in a blameless society maybe it is easier to point out that a river runs through us and that river is called alcohol instead of pointing the finger back at ourselves from the chaos that we have created among the thousands of years the march will never be seen and yes the argument that alcoholism is a shameful personal weakness will forever exist and charles darwin at the end was correct that evolution is about the survival of the fittest 
nothing new to offer available freely on website there are more than popular chart pattern i returned this book becuase whatever he mentioned is freely available on websites i do not want to publicize any website but do a search in google for stock chart or technical indicator and you will get better explanation and tips than what is in this book i can not believe people go to seminar to hear this guy the golden rule if the system works then may be start a hedge fund if it does not then write a book hold seminar 
title contrary to content my husband purchased this book so that we could both spend time for devotional reading in efforts to build and maintain a stronger marriage only to find that the book was really written for couples who have children hence the misleading book title needless to say we were rather disappointed in addition the author seems to have grabbed bible verses at random then writes examples based on not only his but his family s experiences and the vast majority of the verses he used had nothing to do with his stories this is a book more geared to families however i d caution this recommendation due to the randomly selected bible verses 
boycott robert g allen robert g allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer if you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like i did he will send you several junk emails a day unsubscribing doesn t work and trying to block the sender s domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time the funny part is that the emails aren t even coded properly they always show up as just a bunch of html code would you really take internet money making advice from a guy who can t even code html properly anyway his spamming practices are completely illegal and it s only a matter of time before the law catches up with him but that shouldn t come as any surprise considering that mister allen has been in trouble with the law before he s had several run ins with the irs lawsuits against him and a chapter bankruptcy i would also stay away from his nothing down real estate methods many of those practices are illegal and the president of the nothing down club in atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it for more info on allen visit johntreed dottcomm click on real estate investing then click real estate guru ratings bottom line don t trust this guy and don t buy his books and if you re reading this mr allen take me off your mailing list ! 
a real chore to make it through i approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions i did my best to like it to find some secret meaning some redeeming quality within to no avail actually finishing the book was an accomplishment in my opinion ultimately i found the book aimless soulless and the promoter of everything negative about the human species i know this sounds harsh but time after time i felt let down by on the road no i don t dig it dean 
am i having a bad hair day or is this novel boring what s wrong with me i love eudora welty s short stories but this novel was exasperating the story opens at a family reunion in backwoods mississippi where the author overhears endless conversations about nothing carried on by the renfros and their kin for hours they debate whether the family antihero jack renfro will appear at the reunion after several years in the penitentiary for pages i waded through trivial dialogue as family members eagerly awaited jack s appearance i gather from other reviewers comments that the family bad boy did show up eventually but by that time i d left the party i d closed the book and drifted off to sleep if you want plot action this is not the book for you i d suggest you pick up carson mccullers flannery o connor or even william faulkner 
disappointing john hodgeman is great when he s on the jon stewart show the book sadly is boring even as bathroom reading 
it s called the quotrough guide quot because it s rough this book was a disappointment it s information was incomplete and uninformative and i m talking about the recent fifth edition published in even in the touristy beachy destinations i did not find the information helpful many of the budget hotels listed were closed and there were no similar alternatives provided very little historical background for the sites i saw not much value added i spent time on the pacific coast not baja and in the central highlands for nahrit jalisco the bajio and michoacan states it s practically worthless some of the worst maps in the business lonely planet has excellent maps so even if its information is lacking at least you have reliable orientation i would be very careful about buying another rough guide 
it takes a millenium to finish this book i believe that i was possibly unlucky to choose this book as my introduction to mr yehoshua s work for i am told that he is a fabulous writer and a fine creator of believable dialogues well there are no dialogues and the story drags the book however had many characteristics that should make me love it ! my training is that of a historian i fancy in my spare time reading on the middle ages i ve been fascinated with travel writing i ve lived in north africa and to top it off i ve done some reading on judaism in the iberian penninsula and yet this book proved to be a collection of frustrations and it appeared never to end mr yehoshua chose to base his narrative in the oral tradition typical not only to the middle ages but also present in jewish and north african traditions so the development of his story is as repetitive as those told from generation to generation to remind each of the listeners the main characteristcs of what s being mentioned he does it however without the charm that a colloquial narrator would infuse this distant omnipresent narrator who tells us the story instead took away any sense of drama of importance of eagerness and of deeply felt conflicts the narrative line seemed adrift like a boat going from port to port without a chart there was also not a single character that involved this reader emotionally it felt like an intellectual exercise that ended up being too boring to stand it was a struggle for me to finish the book and frankly life is too short for the daily sacrifice i was inflicting on myself 
what a difference evereyone has an opinion on a book so i thought i would share mine yes this book has a ton of information maybe too much for the exam this edition is a far cry from the first one the lab configurations could drive you crazy it was very hard to follow because pod is routers plus a frame switch and backbone routers ! how many people have routers the first edition called for routers in a pod and backbone router this made preparing for configuration exercises easy comparing the ospf section from the st to the nd edition is totally different all the information is the same but the nd edition makes for much harder reading i acutally returned the book i was uncomfortable with the layout and organization of it i am very disapointed with the way the authors changed it they should have left it exactly as the st edition and updated it with new information instead they changed sections and made the labs difficult i guess if you never owned the st edition you would think this book is great 
terrible this book starts of interesting however the book goes on and on and on about scenarios involving people over the phone it rarely mentions person to person or online scams the book suggested solutions to preventing social engineering attacks is really poor i enjoyed the book for a few days but its really same old all the way through many of the stories read like hack philes you can find on the net full of lies and waffle you will find your self bored of the book there are plenty of copies of it on e bay for a reason buy it for sentiment only and because its black i can t believe its by mitnic 
tiresome simplistic romance jane austen s last novel published posthumously receives this year s clunky boring classic award anne elliot on the verge of spinsterhood at is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was lauded by the literary types as exemplifying austen s wit and irony it s really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums 
don t good read but not good paulo coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and i wonder why commercialism good read but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book contradictions over i am waiting for his next novel that will re institute him as the best alas don t buy this book borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time better entertainment watching carnaval or rome on hbo 
don t buy this book i really hate to pan a book because i have a lot of respect for the effort that goes into writing one but do yourself a favor and skip this one i purchased it based on the rave reviews below and then when i recieved it i knew immediatly that i had to return it illustrator gone wild is a sophmoric effort at best it s worth flipping through while in the book store but it s not worth taking home if you ve bothered to learn illustrator from a class or a good book such as adobe s classroom in a book series then you all ready have the skills and knowledge to do everything in the book such as the chapter on making kiss type which i doubt you ll ever be called upon to do but if you want to learn something about the details of making clean professional or even attractive art then you ll find this book lacking as i did the key thing that interested me in the book was the promised chapter on photo realism and the review that said this book was like the wow series only more project oriented the details on photo realism were so scant that one could pick up all this book had to say in minutes of trying to trace and color a shiny metal object this book s similarity to the wow series ends at being a book with chapters words and pictures while it does offer more detail in steps to create art than wow the projects it offers are the kind of thing you d do on a sunday afternoon for fun or for a friend s band who can t afford to pay you but not the kind of thing you d show at work in a portfolio or try to sell freelance 
annoyed i wanted to read this book because of the impact of midnight express quot and was curious as to why he then had such a sparse career now i know his tragically short life is sad as it is for anyone but i couldn t get past being annoyed by how careless he was with the people in his life and careless about his career he was good then he seemed to blow it with bad behavior i know there are reasons for it but i could only feel sorry to a point a lot of my annoyance was the quotname dropping quotsusans reference to would be stars quotthenquot and informing us as to who they have become as if we the public would not know i have the feeling she wanted some vindication for what she went through some acknowledgement for her perseverence and some legacy of value for her husband who can blame her so many people have died of aids so many horrific stories of ordinary people who never had a voice i guess i get annoyed that people look to hollywood for their heroes 
average romance novel i m a nora roberts fan so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to after reading born in fire i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in born in ice brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they can t create further conflict even if she burns with anger inside she s very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story she thinks she ll never have what she dreams of she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess she s always hospitable to her guests she s a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden two places she loves to be although she s surrounded by folks who love her she s still lonely and then comes grayson the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland he s one who lives in the moment ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create the characters compliment each other well they re both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they didn t feel loved she s comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he s not that s where the conflict comes to play and that s kinda where i ve got a problem with the book this is supposed to be a guy who doesn t want emotional ties yet early in the book he s already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her there simply wasn t enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down there was very little if any sexual tension here and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed and even then it seemed like he wasn t really fighting himself for being there there simply wasn t enough of an inner conflict within him it all seemed like lukewarm resistance and brianna was simply a saint i would have liked to see her emote a little more i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts but i don t think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end i will say that the ending was sweet also it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from born in fire id recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer s imagination as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect however if you re looking for a cant put down romance novel this ain t it 
a typical case of padding a thin volume sorry to be the wet blanket at this book party but i was very disappointed in this book first of all here is a case of what i call book padding an author repeating himself frequently and dragging in material that has no real relation to the subject all in the interest of filling up pages had the author deleted most of his repetitive material and all the extraneous matter having to do with the singing group peter paul and mary this book would probably be less than pages as it is now the reader has to skim through endless repetitions and also the author s feeble attempts to somehow connect the book to a folk singing trio printing the lyrics to if i had a hammer in a book dealing with three new testament characters is just plain silly if you think the book is brilliant that is probably because you agree with the author s deep skepticism about the new testament liberals will like this conservatives won t i read this book not because i expected to agree with the author although i tried to keep an open mind but because i was wondering how he would deal with the various legends that sprang up around the three characters in the title for me this was the meat of the book but again he repeats himself endlessly the valid point that the bible tells us very little about mary magdalene is worth stating but not repeating a dozen times im thankful i did not actually buy this book it is certainly not worth the cost 
giving up on steel danielle steel used to be one of my favorite authors however wanderlust was the last book of hers that i really liked i bought the house hoping maybe she had found her style again but alas it was not to be i do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points ofview within one paragraph telling not showing the story and repeating the same things over and over and over until i just want to scream ! it seems that perhaps because she is such a big name her work is not copyread anymore i think it might be time for her to put away her pen or get back to the basics of good writing i will not be buying another of her books anytime soon i chose to rate this book with one star because no stars wasn t a choice 
not useful this book does not deliver on it s cover title i bought this text thinking it will help me learn the basic working details of tcp ip i was totally dissappionted 
waste of time and money this book is by far the worst book i have ever read 
dante for bigots esolen is neither a dante scholar nor an italian language literature specialist he is an english teacher at providence college a catholic institution his retelling of the divine comedy which appears to be based on earlier translations is reasonably accurate and readable the problem comes with his notes they range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive esolen has written a number of anti gay articles for religious publications this is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as that most heinous of sins and there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks this is not only offensive in a contemporary publication but is totally of tune with dante who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c ad there are many superior translations out there mandelbaum s is excellent and has good notes robert and jean hollander s is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all what the modern library had in mind when commissioning this translation which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry remains a mystery 
very slow story i was absolutely bored to tears while reading this book i think that a lot of the suggestions towards better leadership are very well intentioned and are good ideas but it is very heavy in religion if you are a strong believer in jc then this book might appeal to you i was sick of the many religious references by page the story was also poorly written i found myself having to re read portions of the book to understand the point the only thing i will remember from this book is ego youll get it once you ve read it 
i thought it would never end utterly tedious i m not sure byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel i read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism but this tome was virtually unbearable once i hit about the halfway point the first half was somewhat interesting and i had high hopes but as the book quote unquote progressed there just was more and more nothin endless lengthy quotations and frankly boring observations i m not sure i have anything of value to comment on specifically but i would like to forewarn readers this is one of the most trying pretentious uninteresting books i have ever read and i think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers it could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then yuck 
mixed bag a few bombshells but mostly hyperbole this thick x index card of a book touts itself as a takenoprisoners expos when it is in fact merely a collection of random shocking trivia sadly the few real bombshells that the book does contain are overwhelmed by the hyperbolic tone of the rest here are the bombshells facts that might make us seriously re evaluate our relationship with those in power the us is planning to provoke terrorist attacks kent state wasn t the only or even the first massacre of college students during the vietnam era juries are allowed to judge the law not just the facts the government can take your house and land then sell them to private corporations prescription drugs kill over annually work kills more people than warthe quality of the other topics ranges from moderately interesting yet trivial adolf hitler s blood relatives are alive and well in new york state and the virginia colonists practiced cannibalism to no brainers such as advertisers influence on the news media is widespread there is no consistent theme linking the disparate things you re not supposed to know other than the fact that they are supposed to be secrets but that assertion is pure hyperbole after all all it takes to find out that the korean war never ended that nuclear war almost broke out in or that lsd was a used as a powerful adjunct to psychotherapy is a glance at wikipedia hardly a repository of repressed esotericism this is a pretty good place to start learning secret information if you re still embedded in the indoctrination factory we call junior high or high school and it admittedly makes for decent bathroom reading but those interested in real bombshells would do well to look elsewhere 
an unfortunate disappointment i bought this book with the expectation that it would be another quotmistsquot unfortunately i was quite mistaken i found this book to be so boring that i didn t even make it through the whole thing i kept putting it down and picking it up a few weeks later thinking i would eventually finish it but i never did for one helena may start off as a strong character but once her husband and son enter the picture she becomes content to just sit back and watch all of the excitement happen to them i found it odd that a woman with such intellect and education would quietly retire to her country house only kept informed by letters and the once everyfewyears visit of her son i d recommend not reading this one read quotthe mists of avalon quot again instead 
betrayal of trust i received what looked like a nicely preserved used copy the book literally fell apart from the binding the first time i read it it continued to come unglued from the binding each time i attempted to read it not a good quality copy would not purchase from this supplier agai 
i would not recommend it to an associate the books attempts to give the reader a short introduction or insight into process mapping yet it would go to in depth for the basics in addition the author guises the reader by using different terminology for maps such as deployment flowcharts and idef models the astonishing fact about the book is that in the end it attempts to tell you how to analyze a business readers are better off reviewing rengineering books 
all is lost indeed i ordered this on the faith of the title but reached the last pages at least i reached them rather lost often spiteful occasionally prurient more often than not off topic it is a poor catalogue of gripes and complaints we are treated amongst other things to an exhaustive list of the author s gadgets only the ones he can see mind you one assumes there are more stuffed in closets and an alphabetical arrangment of griefs with annoying cross refernces in pure hyper link style doubtlessly to better hide the cobbled together themes when in doubt arrange it all from a to z little effort at sustaining any kind of reflexion on the nature of things lost just an underlying malcontent there are some very good pages he would be well inspired to take the best entries and rewrite the book perhaps what the author most regrets losing is his own childhood lost goodness knows it s never happened to anyone else john how 
disappointing considering the reputation of the source in my opinion this book reads like a school book report it is a disappointment considering the reputation of the source stephen ambrose maybe i expected too much because the author is well known on the other hand i didn t expect too much from the not well known author norman thomas remick and his book quotwest point quot and was most pleasantly surprised but there you are then it s not what you do it s who you know that counts 
this is the worst cat who book yet this is the most boring book i ve read in the series ! i ve read all her books and i couldn t wait to finish this one i can t believe i finished it in the first place ! it has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline if you want to call it a storyline i wouldn t waste money buying this one get it from your library ! the rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true i can t imagine braun writing like this ! 
i need another book just to understand how to use this book i am currently entering my rd year of nursing and of course the school that i attend also requires the use of this hateful book i found it very difficult to use the only recommendation i have is contact your instructors early enough and hope they help you to understand this demon 
disappointing monday morning on release day of this book i stopped by a b n to pick up this book when they didn t have it i drove an hour to try another store finally i ordered it on amazon and paid extra for second day delivery since i am relatively new to functional programming i can t judge the technical content i can tell you that other beginners should stay away from this book the writing style is surprisingly bad considering the author has a degree in english and this book had a professional editor much of the book looks like a bad cut paste job the author often describes a concept in very general terms dumps a dozen lines of code and moves on without ever explaining what the code is doing strange for a programming language book there are free ocaml tutorials on the web which do a much better job of explaining the language the publisher did a good job with practical lisp how come this book doesn t have the same quality at this book will be going right back to amazon 
lots of drawings but little info this booklet has a lot of warner brothers drawings but it doesn t delve into the specifics of creating animation very well i d recommend getting the animator s survival kit instead as it has tons of good and well explained info on the art of creating your own animation 
worst purchase on amazon ever do not buy this product unless you are a nasa computer programer i m pretty computer savy but could never make this work 
blood soaked fantasies i ll start with the positive the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word tall good looking smart humble etc the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words in short it was a competent work of fiction thats where my praise ends because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas sure it s a work of fiction no one is going to take it seriously yada yada yada but that s not true is it so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged just look at the reviews to find the believers alright here are my problems with it first politicians are corrupt and will sell out anyone to maintain power but that s not true if you re a conservative farm boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state in term limits vince flynn just beats you over the head with the power corrupts mantra he doesn t show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist you know what though there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what s right who really are trying to make a difference for the positive for this nation and the citizens in this book however the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren t smart enough to make good decisions second murder is a viable answer this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy land come on get real this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn t balance the budget and they get away with it because it s really the right side to be on murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation that being elections elections apparently just get in the way third the balanced budget for years and years until the time this book was written conservatives cried about the budget the book makes it the central theme balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible it s important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel a coup yet when the conservatives did take power despite vince flynn s prescient forecasting ability they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn t flinch even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility they claim that now the deficit isn t a big deal that it s really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the s and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later it s like looking back in time to a parade of nit witsfourth the good guys don t do bad things the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents just the politicians the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it killing is good when only your target dies but whatever happened to that oh so famous though shalt not cv ric 
waste of time if you do not have infinite patience do not buy this book while it contains over pages of nutritional information and is very comprehensive it has no organization to it there is a very brief table of contents and no index at all the contents are arranged alphebetically but there is no color coding or shading on the edges of the pages to indicate where a stops and b begins and so on i hated using it and only did so for about a week then i went out and bought a new calorie counting book which also included fat and carb information which is all i need and wanted my replacement book contains a table of contents an index and is color coded and cost about the price of this one 
big disappointment the storyline and the characters were intriquing enough to keep me reading all the way to the end however they were never fully developed and nothing was explained or resolved i found myself wondering why certain characters and suppositions were thrown in since the author never went anywhere with them ms fowler should have taken time to at least connect some of the dots she s too good an author to have presented this as a finished book ! there are too many good books out there and too little time to read them don t waste you time on this one 
results need supporting evidence the scientific method applied to this book form a hypothesis great managers do something differently than mediocre managers conduct an experiment interview managers analyze data this step is missing draw conclusions write this book with the exception of the questions the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study they make several insightful statements such as many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes however they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement did of the managers interviewed state this did of the great managers state this while only of the mediocre managers did does many managers mean managers managers seems like many managers at first but considering were interviewed i managers is a negligible amount the entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study it seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently the authors found almost no common trends however since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study they needed something to show for it and wrote this book if buckingham and coffman didn t claim this book was a result of the largest study of its kind i would say it offers some decent advice however since it does make this claim i wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are 
totally unrealistic i have read open house and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing not only did i not identify with betta i actually disliked her and like many other reviewers i found most of her actions completely implausible a year old woman renting a room in a house with two yearolds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home they must have been laughing at her behind her back ! there were so many storylines started that never went anywhere for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war 
do a google search first before you buy this book cut paste the following words into a google search hank hanegraaff financialthen come back to this review it makes me weap to see christian ministries misuse god s money my advice if you really must read this book buy it used so the money goes to a struggling book seller 
groaners every page this book was difficult to get through the writing felt very well written imagine an fbi agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough zingers on every page he has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results i personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion add to this the idiocy of the main character acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work i shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes when sydney has met with a deadly baldaccis thesaurus apparently has only two words deadly and murderous intruder in her home sydney has a weapon trained on him at near point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch ! milliseconds before she can fire he launches himself behind the couch is this crouching tiger hidden dragon no just baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
don t quit your dayjob maybe the worst thriller i ve read in years the dialogue characters and plot are at best soap opera material and that s giving it a positive spin i hope mr hosp is a good lawyer and we all know what wm shakespeare said about that profession 
i feel sorry for isaac asimov if he were alive to see what allen did to his robot universe he would strangle the guy this is a perfect example of why allen should ve stuck to those little house on the prairie sequels the basic idea of inferno just like it s predecessor caliban is the creation of two new kinds of robots the new law robots and the no law robot and their effect on the society of the planet inferno the new law robots are freer than the original three law robots in asimov s books but have their own share of problems caliban the only robot created with no laws is of course the most free but is far from human this is all well and good and in a more capable writer s hands would have been interesting but allen takes his one or two good ideas and throws them in a turbine i m sorry mr allen but i don t really care about the intimate details of tierlaw verick s body or anyone else s for that matter whatever happened to quotdont tell show quot 
all that glitters is not gold a long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish not just an ordinary fish but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean this is a book i have some trouble with it is beautifully illustrated and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children however i am not entirely sure it is sending the right message i like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy but ultimately the solution to the rainbow fish s problems give unclear messages and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness 
simple this book is painfully simple covering only common sense issues this book is will be redundant for anyone who has studied the martial artts for more than a month 
longest runway in the world the story takes forever to take off after an almost interminable and it seems to me unnecessary set up about pulps and pulp writing the author appears to have little confidence in the reader s ability to figure out who the historical characters are and spends a lot of time making sure you are impressed by them perhaps if you are a big fan of this genre of writing and know a lot about it the book is more fun just as stories at reunions are inevitably more interesting to the alumni than to the guests 
great if everything is pre cooked most of the recipes call for prepared meat not too helpful if you want to actually cook on the fire a few clever things but i m returning it not very useful 
just plain horrible if you re looking for writing that is as clever or as witty as dean koontz s take one pace back away from this book if you re expecting storyytelling on par with john grisham take another step back if you re hoping for a story loaded with interesting tidbits and facts on par with dan brown take another step back this book was unoriginal boring predictable and very cliche don t waste your time or your money like i did 
this book is pure baloney and propaganda global warming is not controversial among scientists for many years there has been almost universal agreement among climate scientists that global warming is happening and that human pollution is largely responsible so why is this still controversial largely because a handful of skeptics like michaels have thrown up a dust cloud of confusion around the issue through popular books newspaper opinion pieces television and radio appearances and other tactics they have skillfully exploited the media s desire for balance in their reporting when in fact they are in an extreme scientifically isolated minority many politicians have been swept up in their deceptions michaels gets huge amounts of money from the coal and oil industries which stand to lose if we start getting serious about addressing climate change doesn t that say it all about this man s credibility 
this book teaches that being beautiful is wrong this book is so beautiful on the outside it s a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong the story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no after which none of the other fish will play with it the fish is advised by someone wise to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it it follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy for me this is a terrible moral ! it s wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way you should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won t be jealous it s ok to demand other people give you things that you covet yuk ! 
interesting read but not realistic this book either needs a re write a re vamp or a recall so much of the information seems out of date for example whitney gives a pretty amusing example of how to get k of credit fairly quickly basically he advises you to open a savings account at a small bank with k if you don t have k he advises you borrow it from someone then a week or so later he suggests you ask for a k loan a signature loan against your k in the bank and use that money to open another account at another bank and do the process over again use the money that you borrowed from the second bank to repay the first loan and then do it again at a third bank this could work but he never really adresses the fact that it s going to cost you k plus interest to do this if you borrow a your first thousand you re always going to have to pay back k and where are you going to get that money then he focuses on renting out rooming houses or buying dumps and fixing them up into something a little nicer basically you ll be providing housing for transient types or welfare recipients as he seems to only advise buying cheap run down properties that s great if you have plenty of fire insurance for when the tenants meth lab explodes and burns down your investment but otherwise it s not to attractive a proposition another tactic discussed is to find a motivated seller which usually means someone under stress or financial hardship then you take advantage of them and pay them far less than their property is worth you may be able to get a good deal shortchanging old ladies out of their house once their husband dies and and the kids move away but personally i d have a hard time sleeping at night bottom line you might get something out of this book but i wouldn t recommend it it s not really realistic and whitney comes across as kind of a sleeze 
ageless i think not tonight i saw mr chopra on television i was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless common folks put two and two together why can t he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises my dr friend was correct about chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money the shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the tv he was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude full of criticism for western thought christianity america s foreign policy etc i am not saying we are perfect or there isn t room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the western culture he had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment it sells more books healing appts lecturers etc i copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge the kind of arrogance that came across by chopra on tv tonight before finishing want to say it s ok to want to make a fortune only don t wear false spirituality to do so in the early s i went to the marharishi meditation center in ny where they charged for the mantra the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra ! i was so young and naive then there was baghwan with the fleet of roll royces and a hefty bank acct he had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe ! that guy feed into the human desire of some to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want endless sex drugs etc no judgment all this done in the name of being more spiritual enlightened than the rest of us ! chicanery comes in many forms only in searching for the new often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them end having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years following their fears and struggles it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer if chopra could show one case of a person who could do this including himself i d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands this is a travesty of the hippocratic ideal and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial money loving peddlers of false hopes star rating is inevitable i hate to say luckily there are many good sources of the same knowledge that chopra embezzles hope i haven t been too harsh i have no wish to attack chopra but i wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging health and dying 
steer clear of this one when i had first heard of dream boogie a page biography of the late sam cooke i was ecstatic up until that point i had only known of one other biography of sam cooke you send me which i haven t gotten around to reading i eagerly bought a copy of the book from my local barnes noble expecting an enormous gem of truth about sam that would prove to be both through and entertaining for readers of this review there is now a third sam cooke biography written by erik greene entitled our uncle sam who is erik greene you may ask he s sam s great nephew but let us return to dream boogie peter guralnick is known as the definitive biographer of sam cooke having written liner notes for digitally remastered cds and much more peter guralnick worked on writing and gathering the materials for dream boogie for more than fifteen years therefore one might well assume that he would write an enormous gem of truth that proved to be both through and entertaining let us begin with the good points of this page biography peter guralnick chose to interview a large portion of the sam cooke family something daniel wolff did not do naturally erik greene did guralnick includes commentary from his father his brothers his sisters his business associates his close friends and most importantly his widow barbara cooke ever since the death of her husband has never conducted any interviews regarding sam for the past forty years naturally she provides a unique but also a brutally honest commentary regarding her life and sam s however guralnick does not deviate from his course he is still extremely through to say the least in the actual history of sam s life he doesn t miss a single thing in my opinion there is a flaw to this in the art of writing if you re too through with a subject you will bog the reader down immensely guralnick gets an a on this one throughout the page biography guralnick succeeds in providing the reader with so very much information that is indeed interesting but not important to the overall history of sam he also succeeds in doing the exact opposite over the more important and memorable aspects of sam s life in the s he stood up against the police in memphis after the police told him to push the car to the side of the road specifically he told him sir my name is sam cooke if you haven t heard of me your wife knows me when you get home tonight you ask your wife if she knows sam cooke i don t push no car this is my car my brother ran out of gas i m not pushing it you want to put a ticket on it put a ticket on it but i don t push no car not mine not yours not nobody s elses i m not a pusher i m a singer sam then proceeded to sit back in his car his brother came with the gas and they left the police left them alone depending upon your interpretation this could be seen as one of the first steps for sam regarding the civil rights movement which led to his greatest composition a change is gonna come an african american response to bob dylan s blowing in the wind this also leads to another flaw in guralnick s work a complete lie over an important television appearance of sam daniel wolff also makes the same mistake in february of sam appeared on the tonight show and it s known that he sang basin street blues as the performance still survives however according to both guralnick and wolff sam also sang a change is gonna come on the same show i m not sure what wolff does in an attempt to prove this but guralnick uses a cue sheet with a similar title to a change is gonna come to prove that sam did indeed sing the song i recently contacted a carson archivist and sam never sung the song it took me a day to figure it out guralnick worked on this book for more than fifteen years if he went through such work to that the song was planned why wouldn t he check the log book of the episode to see if sam sung the song to be completely sure during the days of the tonight show some guests would exceed the length of time they occupied and therefore some guests would never make it onto the show perhaps that s not a very big flaw in the biography of sam it s only a single event consider this on the eighth page of the biography there is a picture with the caption a very young sam cooke the eighth page and guralnick makes a major mistake it s not sam it s his brother l c three months after the book was released the mistake was corrected if guralnick cannot properly identify a photo of the person he s writing about what other mistakes is he prone to make in the book perhaps the biggest mistake guralnick makes is stating that the official version of events concerning sam s death was how it went down as i read the chapter regarding sam s death i seriously considered whether or not guralnick was employed by allen klein whom sam was planning to fire who was allen klein i don t know too much about him myself but i do know that he swindled the cooke family out of the royalties of sam s catalog with help from one of sam s daughters and his widow i do know that he also conned the beatles as well as the rolling stones that s about it yet he uses allen klein s and barbara cooke s commentary exclusively if you do a google search about the death of sam you ll find an analysis of the official version of events that pokes five large gaping holes into the official version of events in addition the coroner s inquest was a complete joke and contradicted itself numerous times daniel wolff didn t believe the official version of events sam s fans don t believe the official version of events and sam s family doesn t believe the official version of events pretty much no one believes the official version of events other than guralnick im not sure what wolff does to debate what really happened that night but erik greene includes a report in his book that is extremely different from the official version of events well you may say that he would naturally do that considering sam was a member of his family instead of using the facts from the coroner s inquest and related events greene chooses to tackle the mystery of sam s death via a pathology report scientifically speaking i believe that it s quite accurate heres the rather discerning part peter guralnick is known as the definitive biographer of sam cooke but of course no biography doesn t have its flaws however keep in mind that i do not cite all the mistakes made in dream boogie i can probably cite four or five more off the top of my head but i think i ve trashed the book enough what s the worst part the flaws in dream boogie known as the sam cooke bible could be perhaps passed off as truth by a less thanfamiliar historically speaking sam cooke fan and are blatantly obvious to the die hard fans of sam cooke if you want a good biography of sam that is entertaining through and truthful either check out wolff s biography or greene s biography which i highly recommend which was by a member of the family of sam cooke 
no details this book is a great idea but is very skimpy with the details the interviews consist of two questions the same for each person that cover general advice but nothing specific about what the careers involve some fields don t need this detail high school education is something most of us are familiar with but if i want to learn what a policy advisor actually does every day i ll need to look beyond the policy career section of this book it was full of advice for success improve your communication skills do what you love but rather short on what tasks you d actually need to succeed at to make it in a particular career 
beyond the occult this book should have been a hard back and it isn t i will be returning it as the order was incorrect 
hard to read loved his other books but this was all over the place hard to read and to apply 
what s the point very little plot which is boring the reader should be paid by the page if not by the word to read this book ! 
eww this is the worst book i have ever read ! it is ssssssssssssssooooooo dull ! even grunt is better than this eww eww eww ! go try some real books like the chronicles of narnia the underland chronicles inkheart and the inheritance trilogy it will do you some good great thing not to read this awful book ! 
research and theory construction this book s title shows that qualitative research is its primary subject and developing grounded theory is its secondary subject the opposite is true in the case of the book coauthored earlier by strauss the discovery of grounded theory strategies for qualitative research in the interval between the writing of the two books strauss may have realized that his thesis was about research work more than theory construction but the text of this second book too presents research work as theory construction as explained below it could be thought that what is to be called a theory is a linguistic issue but the definition of this term must not prevent the construction of real theories as distinct from empirical knowledge in lieu of the implicit definition of theory that appeared in the earlier book p an explicit one is given in this second book a set of well developed concepts related through statements of relationship which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena p the new and critical but obscure expressions in this definition are well developed concepts and integrated framework whereas the idea of explaining or predicting phenomena by using a theory appeared also in the earlier definition as i mentioned in my review of the earlier book explaining or predicting phenomena can be done by using empirical knowledge too and therefore cannot be considered a distinguishing characteristic of theories for example the empirical laws of electromagnetism known before maxwell served to explain predict and control many electromagnetic phenomena but did not constitute a theory the authors repeat the same mistake when they admit that a theory is more than a set of empirical findings and continue by saying it offers an explanation of phenomena p they also say generating theories about phenomena rather than just generating a set of findings is important to the development of a field of knowledge pp that is correct but the problem is to know how theories are generated also findings too serve to explain phenomena as mentioned although they have a narrower scope than theories statements of relationship between phenomena are commonly referred to as hypotheses p any hypotheses and propositions derived from data must be continuously checked out against incoming data and modified extended or deleted as necessary p the key concept here which the authors do not clarify sufficiently is the derivation of hypotheses from data first some relationships between phenomena can be deduced from the data but what is thus produced constitutes not a hypothesis but empirical knowledge about those phenomena it is when those relationships are generalized through induction in newton s words that they become general rules which are of hypothetical nature or hypotheses because induction yields only probabilities not certainties as bertrand russell emphasized the authors seem to ignore this fact moreover when the hypotheses thus derived from data are continuously checked out against incoming data and modified extended or deleted as necessary and those that are conserved are finally supported by all new information they stop being hypotheses and become empirically known facts and any set of such facts constitutes empirical knowledge not a theory the authors seem not to have a clear view of where induction and deduction are used anytime a researcher derives hypotheses from data because it involves interpretation we consider that a deductive process p a relationship that is deduced from the data related to some singular phenomena constitutes empirical knowledge about those phenomena a hypothesis is created out of that knowledge when it is generalized through induction the total process is not only deduction but involves also induction the authors express these facts in an obscure way thus at the heart of theorizing lies the interplay of making inductions deriving concepts their properties and dimensions from data and deductions hypothesizing about the relationships between concepts the relationships also are derived from data but data that have been abstracted by the analyst from the raw data p what the authors unclearly describe as abstracted by the analyst from the raw data is what newton meant by the words generalized through induction and the generalization must cover phenomena that do not allow the deduction of the hypothesis from the data if the hypothesis is expected to be used to construct a theory the authors conclude at the end it is hoped the researcher has systematically developed the products of analysis into a theory p the major mistake in this conception of theory construction is that it ignores the following fact a hypothesis that is checked out against incoming data ie fits the data is deducible from the data is no more a hypothesis but empirical knowledge and therefore a system of statements only such hypotheses constitutes not a theory but a group of empirical knowledge the authors repeat the same mistake when they say that a theory is validated during the actual research process what can be validated during the actual original research process is empirical knowledge a second phase of research is concerned with the validation of the theory i e with showing that the consequences of the theory fit the phenomena or that they are deducible not only from the theory but also from the phenomena consequently the theory becomes usable in explaining predicting and controlling the phenomena only when knowledge that is deduced or readily obtained from the raw data related to some singular phenomena is generalized through induction and assumed or hypothesized to be valid also in relation to phenomena that do not make possible the deduction of that hypothesis from the data that a hypothesis is created that can be used to construct a theory this means that a theory contains at least one hypothesis that cannot be deduced from the empirical data related to all phenomena to which it is assumed to apply the reason for this is that a law of nature may be deduced from the data related to some phenomena but not from the data related to other phenomena consequently by transferring knowledge from one set of phenomena to another can provide hypothetical knowledge that is otherwise unavailable a theory is a set of general statements or laws of which at least one is such a non testable hypothesis at the time of the construction of the theory after a theory is thus constructed consequences are deduced from it that serve to explain predict and control the related phenomena the usefulness of a theory in doing these things constitutes the proof of its usability and also the proofs of all of its contents including the non testable hypothesis or hypotheses when phenomena that do not fit a tested and accepted theory are encountered a more general theory is constructed the old theory is not discarded by being considered wrong but remains in use in the area where it is valid because it is simpler than the more general theory the above presented knowledge about the content and the method of construction of theories is derived from the grand theories of physics i have shown in my books how the same method can be used in psychology too as an example i constructed a theory of automatic responses such as the symptoms of non organic mental disorders dreams cerebral lateralization as structural response etc this theory serves not only to explain and predict those phenomena but also to control them very effectively where this is possible i had to mention these here because the best test of ideas is their usefulness in explaining predicting and controlling the phenomena although strauss and corbin advocate what they call grounded theory which is in reality nothing else than empirical knowledge they expose their distrust of their work which contains many unclear points when they warn the reader by saying remember that a theory is just that a theory p theories inspire more respect when their method of construction and their function are better understood 
bad television show in words if you are a cop or in law enforcement this book might be worth your while however you re better off skipping this one there are too many other good books out there since when does piecing together interview after interview quote after quote pass for good writing i get the feeling that schulman spent time as a stenographer there are so many people so many different angles in this book that i don t even think schulman could keep track of it all 
a perfect storm it isn t a perfect bore maybe i really enjoyed the perfect storm so i gave ms greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book i was less than impressed i lasted till page where i just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story this is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of junger s book sebastian junger s blurb on the cover was anyone who loves the sea will love this book i think not 
why rule of thumb in computer era as a desginer i can not understand the meaning of this book take any scantling rule of classification societies and compare scantlings section of rulebook is much more thin but provides more optoins and engineering basics for calculations of strength what is the meaning of gerr s own scantling rule if you have to proceed design approval from classification society you better use the rulebook of this society aren t you the book use several assumptions that i mind for example the recommendation to add some per cent of hull thickness for every knot over knots is not reasonabe the designer should deal with speed length ratio to determine planning non planning bottom loads the book does not give any idea of hull loads overview of loads is desired as soon as he write about strength something like provided in l larsson r eliasson principles of yacht design but i really like other gerr s books indeed best regards anazarov naval architect ph d 
what is the societal impact this is a book about our society and yet i am left wondering how everything bad for us actually affects our society i believe the author s underlying presumption is that improving the individual improves our society as a whole this societal analysis however is completely missing the book can be summed up as follows games and software are more complex therefore our problem solving ability has increased tv is more complex therefore our emotional intelligence has increased the internet gives us new ways to connect with others therefore our communication abilities have increased the litmus test for all this is increasing iq scores part i of the book goes to great lengths to explain how an individual s mental muscle is increased through popular media games tv software and the internet part ii asserts that increased iq scores are the proof that our mental muscle is increasing the individual may be benefiting from popular media but is our society benefiting are more technological breakthroughs happening are we better able to piece together disparate facts provided by the media and government into a cohesive whole is software easier to use so we can more easily accomplish our goals are communities and homes being designed better so they improve communication between neighbors and families can we better recognize the underlying motives of our politicians are we making great strides to decrease global warming air and water pollution forest depletion species extinction famine homelessness cancer and disease gender and racial inequality and the distribution of wealth if our ability to see connections and solve problems has improved why do a vast number of americans still believe there is a connection between and iraq why do we not recognize that the diversity of plant and animal species on the planet directly affects our well being why do we seem incapable of understanding that many of the divisive issues we focus upon eg school prayer flag burning abortion gay marriage are simply manifestations of larger societal problems eg inequality poverty domination and control how is the popular media affecting these societal and technological issues is it making them worse this is the missing part of the book that i hope will be addressed in another edition 
little conceptual explanation i m currently using this book for my process calculations course the book has many example problems and covers unit conversions material balances energy balances single phase and multi phase systems etc yet the theory is almost non existent and the reader is presented with a lot of facts and formulae crammed in with very little conceptual emphasis i do not recommend this book as an introduction to a process calculations cours 
confusing nervous with dishonest this man obviously knows nothing about human behavior most people know that just because someone can t hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest in more cases than not they simply have low self esteem are very self conscious and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or i might do when asked to do improv this man himself is a manipulator and a liar he s manipulating you to get this book taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience lying and hypnotizing people in order to get the truth out of them is far less effective than being honest yourself if you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars you will start to have an understanding of people s energies if you just pay attention 
maryjanice what happened the first two betsy taylor books were short but packed with humor and action i ve re read them both several times and still love them this one it seems like she whipped it off in less than a month and didn t put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others the plot is thin the characters far less developed and the book is overall a disappointment especially in light of how excellent her first two vampire queen books were sadly the fourth book in the series undead and unreturnable is even worse i advise anyone wanting to read either unappreciated or unreturnable to get them from the library they are not worth buying try kim harrison s dead witch walking instead or katie mcalister s you slay me if you want something lighter and hope that mjd gets her act together and starts writing well again 
i wish i read the reviews st i normally don t write reviews but i wish the authors of this book would have put their selves in the shoes of those who wish to improve their gameplay the strategy s are very limited there is nothing on the best approaches to take in the game sequence i m disappointed that nothing is in depth about unit counters i wish there was a good explanation on the use of hotkeys and how best to group units i also wish there was an easy to use chart showing the attributes of the game units in a way company heroes reminds me of the age of empires series but it is far superior however the strategy guide book for age of empires is far superior to this book and was the type of game information i was expecting 
very disappointing not a spy thriller but a novel about self absorbed middle aged men who happen to be former spies which is fine except the book is sold as a thriller and the blurb is full of praise for the tension and pace talk about false advertising ! the story really only gets going in the last pages or so and then it suddenly ends without any resolution even considers as a character study with no pretensions as a spy thriller this book disappoints it s far too full of annoying whatho old chap overgrown public ie private schoolboys and the main characters are totally unsympathetic cranmer is a sad sack pettifer encountered only in flashback is a narcissistic boor and emma likewise only seen in flashback is a vacuous airhead thirty years ago le carre might have taken this premise and made something worth reading out of it once every hundred pages or so there is a flash of his former skill which only makes the book more disappointing 
not impressed by cabot i expected great things from cabot s books i was let down i did not care for her writing style nor did i find her information moving or educational i am genuinely surprised that so many people find cabot to be a literary value i just don t see it i would not recommend cabot s works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft 
not a page turner a friend recommended this book to me so i picked it up from the start i had to force myself to keep going i read the whole book but i wouldn t recommend it 
really a religious book i m giving this book stars because of it s engaging writing style and because mr brady does a good job of identifying and describing the major painprone personalities however if you have physical pain that is caused by actual anatomical dysfunction such as in my case severly herniated disks this book will probably not help you the mind body connection has been massively documented in countless medical phychological and metaphysical literature and there is no doubt that the mind can heal as well as cause illness while the reviews of this book do speak of the spiritual connection what if fails to tell you is that mr brady uses the terms spriritual and religion synonymously further the religion that mr brady identifies is the christian religon specifically protestant christianity so what it really boils down to is faith healing if you are a christian this book may be of some help to you if you believe in faith healing and have not yet been helped by your church or prayers dr brady asks you to do extensive journaling and guides you with many questions including what is your relationship with god what was your relationship with god when you were a child mr brady takes the work of dr sarno and expands on it to fit his own conception of mind body healing even changing the words that dr sarno uses to describe the pain that is felt because of muscular tention for those that have been helped by dr brady s method i say wonderful ! good for you ! dr brady was also helped by dr sarno s work but for me this book was really a dud 
shallow self indulgence i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items which usually disuades me from a selection so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work i found it smug self serving and self indulgent written by a person with little or no empathy especially for the people he castigates for example his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the shrink bashers of the world this play for effect tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
great title but dissapointing content the book grabs the reader with an interesting title then immediately starts off with a look at a boring movie and then reviews of even more boring competing therories finally the authors reveal the information ecology therory unfortuanately the don t offer much to back up their view and paint a picture of it being another feel good pc therory too bad since they have a valid point that will sadly be lost as another pc mistake 
interesting theory but it didn t work for us when my husband and i decided to start a family we agreed that we would be happy with either gender but we both preferred to have a girl i had read the book years prior and decided to read it again before we attempted to conceive i began charting my cycles as instructed and even purchased expensive ovulation test kits to make sure our timing was right after months of calculated attempts i found out i was pregnant we were sure it was a girl since we followed the instructions from the book exactly well my ultrasound was last week and we discovered we re having a boy ! after seeing his little body wiggling around on the screen we quickly realized that this baby is the love of our lives and that the gender never really mattered mother nature knows best ! 
real philosophy or social choice yes it s true the book of sen it s too much focused on the theory of social choice and it never makes an analysis of freedom and rationality by a pure philosophical point of view but always by the point of view of the social choice and it s also true that this kind of analysis is often related to the impossibility theorem of arrow as all the social choice theory could be reducted to that theoremi think the title of the book does not say the essence of it people philosophically intrested in these two concepts should read something else 
ponderous reading this is one extremely ponderous book to read the author makes several well intentioned points only to get bogged down in his own research and wordiness read it if you must be sure you have lots of time to decipher it once you have 
i made it to chapter i bought this book immediately after reading enquiry which i liked very much unfortunately i was disappointed with this one i made it to chapter to three barely i wanted to like this book but frankly i was bored by both the plot and the characters maybe next time 
did you all actually read it first off i am an avid reader and love a long challenging read however this novel is one of the worst i have ever read ! it is long boring and has absolutely no plot i purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews although from the looks of most of them here i personally suspect that many of those who raved never actually read the book 
three points about this book after reading this book i would like to make three points about it first of all don t make this your first dean koontz book this is the second book of the so called christopher snow trilogy read the first book in the trilogy first fear nothing the first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book second please be aware that koontz has yet to write the third book in the christopher snow trilogy this is a real shame because seize the night ends on a cliffhanger of sorts koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday under the title ride the storm but since it s been over eight years since koontz has written a snow novel i wouldn t expect this book anytime soon third i must admit i didn t really care for this book at all and i say that as a koontz fan lots of padding the action doesn t really start until page koontz wastes a lot of space repeating things he originally wrote in fear nothing i found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts the plot here is also too over the top plot elements include time travel killer monkeys alternate realities serial killers conducting government experiments and that s just the tip of the iceberg ! even the characters in the book don t seem to take any of it seriously all the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic i was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book it was just too silly for my tastes koontz is a great writer but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable fast paced plot instead of this book i would therefore recommend watchers intensity odd thomas or velocity 
not written by d but another in household this book is inspiring in the way that it encourages people to trust god perhaps i should ve given it two stars but what dissappointed me within reading the first two pages were the statements of quotwe deserve judgement quot and quothe was a godly fugitive quot perhaps being a little over analytical or precise i would like to comment that man himself is not godly thus using the word quotgodlyquot to discribe someone who wishes to follow quotgods ways quot should not be described as quotgodlyquot due to its misleading implications second of all the book should be precise on quotwe deserve judgement quot yes it is true that jesus christ is lord of all and that this book has much good coming from it s pages but one must wonder if the good that is meant to encourage can be ruined with inaccurate text that does not coalign with scripture god is the righteous judge and although we do not deserve his mercy he is a god most of all of love amp truth please understand that i am not bashing this book there are a lot of encouraging passages but the quotspider scenario quot and other statements are misleading and do not rely all on scripture one should still satisfy ones curiosity and may do so in quotborrowingquot this book but in order for one to be a quotcarefulquot and quotpassionatequot christian one should not be afraid to question what one is reading 
peter s singing out of tune this is the third book by peter singer which i have read and therefore i knew what to expect arguments propped up with poor logic yet nonetheless presented to the reader with the tone one would expect as if singer were repeating the obvious for the umpteenth time yet like the man who just has to take one last whiff of spoiled milk before tossing it down the drain i found myself reaching for one world on the book shelf to get singer s take on globalization i usually am not such a glutton for punishment but i guess the human psyche is funny that way the biggest problem with one world is the same as with all of singer s writings he assumes that the big questions of ethics over which some of the most brilliant minds in history have pondered have all been resolved and of course they have all been resolved in his favor the result is that singer presents ideas that actually require intellectual defense as axiomatic starting points from which he begins one need only to examine the introduction to see this the very first page of text states that national leaders either view things from the perspective of national self interest or they view things ethically nice false dichotomy huh even if one agrees with singer s conclusion there are numerous views of ethics that point in the other direction some would view a self interested or national interested position as good in and of itself others would argue that a non global view actually benefits more people worldwide through the beneficial interactions between parties and because anyone thinking globally would have far too many factors to consider for any decision and therefore would create mischief through unintended consequences also in the introduction singer asserts that the united nations is the only institution that may legitimately project force in the international arena specifically because any nation may join he contrasts this with an institution such as nato which has specific requirements for membership yet once again singer does nothing to address the possibility that perhaps ethics points in the other direction i e because any nation may join actually gives the united nations less authority than a selected group of free states in which membership has its requirements such faulty premises riddle one world s treatment of issues both large and small singer supports the international criminal court and criticizes the united states for not signing on without any analysis as to the u ss unique position as the world s sole superpower and how this might be a solid and justifiable basis for the u s to follow a different path after all most countries are not able to project their militaries globally and few are asked to do so to compare their actions with those of the u s seems rather specious singer advocates uh i mean ethics dictates a significantly higher tax rate on people in wealthy nations the economics behind this are not discussed nor is there any meaningful discussion of how economics and ethics might intersect on this issue if lower tax rates produce more overall wealth due to expansion of the economy which by the way is the case then any ethics worth its name should advocate such this would produce more money for those in affluent nations while providing poor nations an impetus for changing inefficient economies singer attempts to get around this by focusing on poor people rather than on poor nations and stating that these people need help now maybe so but so will their children and their children s children etc etc etc until systematic changes are put into place singer s ethics would prevent this from happening examples of such sloppy thinking and inferential leaps go on and on throughout the book singer even fails to properly support his apparently boundless enthusiasm for the united nations although he acknowledges that the u n needs reform his discussion of this is anemic he suggests that the u n should refuse to recognize any government that rules without the support of its people but fails to explain how this differs in any meaningful way from a collection of self selected states such as nato which he has already deemed inferior to the u n on the specific ground that the u n is open to all nations no mention is made to numerous u n scandals over the years nor does singer address the u ns rather pathetic history of negotiating relationships between its members what does it say that the one single nation which has had the most u n resolutions passed against it israel is a free liberal democracy that guarantees free speech freedom of religion and civil rights to all of its citizens regardless of race or ethnicity are we really to believe that israel s neighbors have better track records with respect to human rights of course not yet no other middle eastern state feels the lash of the u ns whip like israel singer does nothing to address either this specific issue or more importantly the larger issues about how the u n functions that this example illuminates singer is so blind in his devotion to the u n that he writes with respect to kofi annan sitting by while a genocide was taking place in rwanda that annan has learned from this situation let us put aside the uncomfortable argument that there is little evidence to support the proposition that annan has learned anything instead let us focus on singer giving annan what amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist while harshly criticizing the united states for taking military action that has a verifiable track record of destroying tyrannies freeing millions of people and setting up the foundations for free independent governments like to hear it or not more people in this world are free because of u s military power than because of any other single factor what could possibly account for this discrepancy other than a results oriented approach i e singer gives annan the pass because annan s aspirations of one world government are consistent with singer s own not surprisingly the united states comes in for heavy criticism in one world it is telling that singer feels the need to employ verbal inflation about the u s dominating over and ruling the rest of the world but singer s criticism of the u s depends on one buying into his views as i do not i point to singer s criticism of the u s as evidence that the u s is doing things basically right it will be a sad day in america if its foreign policy is ever complimented by peter singer 
don t possibly the worst book i have ever read the style could be bested by a not toobright fifth grader the plot is an imbecilic rehash of the divinci code don t bother keeping track of any details because everything turns out to be irrelevant if you want to entertain yourself and your friends however check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk now open the book at random and read aloud this should cause hysterical i cantbelievethisgotpublished laughter 
perverted i m sorry i wasted the money i can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it i m not squeamish by nature but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims but animals as well three quarter s way through when i realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end i started skipping these parts which got me to the last page quite quickly i was bored and disgusted with the author i believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages in the end my eyeballs got six pack abs from rollng around so much this book is going on my do not lend shelf as i value my friends and wouldn t consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense 
get the whole picture elsewhere it certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge based workers are the future in american society it seems to me that drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize marx which was a complete failure drucker didn t even fully analyze globalization in its entirety the only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the american worker nonetheless he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in drucker neglects the whole and simply accepts what backs his own perspective 
sooo lifetime if you like this book you will probably like bless the child by cathy cash spellman they are very similar this book can be summed up in one word simple simple minded simple characters simple plot applied loosely and simple premise what a contrived piece of garbage i can t describe everything wrong with this book because there s not enough time if it s meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through if it s meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims in denial weak worried about what everyone thinks or oblivious if it s meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author s plea for that is irritating that s how bad this book is ! it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying this author has no style the book reads like an episode of inside edition there is no immersion into the story the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them as a reader i felt completely outside the story an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable i ve been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me do not waste your time i must say though that this novel was inspirational if this crap can make the best seller list it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
misleading waste of time this guy thinks collectors want to see his own creations of what rare prototypes are what a complete waste of time collectors want to see the real thing most of the quotrarequot prototypes in this book are fakes that santelmo forgets to tell the reader this book would be useful if you are interested in conterfeit items 
one word describes this book zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oh my god was this book a snoozer what a waste of time

perhaps the most over rated book of all time under mark twain s definition a classic book is one which people praise but don t read by that definition tribe s treatise is one of the all time classics if not in fact the greatest classic in the history of the printed word why do people praise this book law professors do it because they all worship tribe since he somehow gets to teach con law at harvard law students praise this book because they know their professors and their friends will be impressed that they own it and that they are able to bring it up in conversation what about this book s actual merits somehow that gets lost in the discussion the book is not very good the prose is turgid the author rambles a lot and large portions of the book are unclear to top it all off the book is incomplete this is volume of a projected two volume set that professor tribe now says will never be completed hallelujah in other words you are paying nearly for a book which was meant to have a counterpart but which never will have a counterpart if any other law professor had written this trash the book would have been discontinued right after the first printing lucky for tribe he has somehow made a name for himself and this book therefore sells thousands of copies every year mainly to law professors and fawning students all of whom like to let others know that they own this book none of whom have actually read more than pages of the book 
a dismal effort by dinosaur ofaphilosopher derrida the renowned french postmodernist and author of among other things writing and difference is at it again in his latest effort adieu to emmanuel levinas his work is designed to cast great doubt on the classical notions of truth reality meaning and knowledge the goal is reprehensible but derrida can usually pull it off adieu to emmanuel levinas is thus a major disappointment to all those fans of outmoded deconstructionist french philosophers the book suffers from being far too personal and lacks detail anecdotes abound but they are in toto not particularly interesting or helpful ones mostly along the lines of childhood vacations to the beach and the like as for the few attempts derrida makes to actually deal with philosophy detail is sorely lacking when a reader comes upon phrases like the hermeneutics of orangutans he she really deserves to have some idea what the author is talking about sometimes you just want to read about eschatalogical polemics or signifier signified interrelations but you won t find that here seen in this or any other light adieu to emmanuel levinas falls pancake flat spend your money on something that makes sense to somebody other than the author i am sad now and it is jaques derrida s fault 
if not for voltaire this book gets burned alas there are not few enough stars to rate this book fairly it is a vacuous bad joke who picked this small minded and petty professor to write about a great one in the history of human world changers gray sounds like one of those shallow artificial and superficial professors of knowledge who like the gnats who ride in the race only barely hanging on to the neck of the thoroughbred and then criticize the way the the race was won everyone involved in this sham ofabook should be ashamed the author is clue less as to the greatness and genius of voltaire and takes cheap and uninformed pot shots at voltaire he pecks away from his little isolated ivory tower at one of the great thinkers liberators in western civilization at voltaire no less who writes from the bastille and uses his wits to enlighten europe and escape the inquisition and the corrupt aristocarcracies who hounded him throughout his years of heoric satire as they say quotwhen a pickpocket sees a saint all he sees are the pockets quot don t waste your time or money and please do not support this publication it s a disgrace and a diservice to a great soul who made it possible for trash like this to be published 
bleeding heart do not waste your money i bought this for class and almost had to burn it after the class was over it is nothing but bleading heart liberal nonsense 
cookbook to fancy i enjoy food but most of the recipes in this book are things i wouldn t eat in the first place 
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz cynical and boring quite a combination quick question you are interested in power male female relationships and female friendships in the big apple yet somehow work gets screwed up relationships go badly and you end up lamenting the sad state of affairs loudly and often in print to your female friends do you a realize that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results and get therapy or find comfort in family or religion orb write a tedious boring book about how hard successful women have it in which the same few complaints are recycled over and over and over and over this author is too cynical for me and her penchant for irritating characters who repeat themselves endlessly is bothersome i don t recommend this except to those not bothered by a quite cynical pov 
book is outdated and inaccurate evangelists like lee strobel and hank haandegriff often quote simon greenleaf in support of their belief the gospels are accurate and historically reliable what they fail to mention is that greenleaf died nearly years ago his book is filled with inaccuracies and faulty logic in his defense he was obviously unaware of all the new testament research which has been done over the past century and a half for example greenleaf was unaware the authors of the gosples are unknown the names were merely assigned by the early church he believed matthew and john were actual eyewitnesses although those accounts were written years after the death of jesus what court would accept as valid a report by unknown sources written several decades after the events greenleaf s book is very biased he often refers to jesus as quotour savior quot his book is also filled with illogical assumptions he assumes the authors are quotgoodquot men and would not lie on the one hand he states the gospels are trustworthy because they have discrepancies and contradictions and on the other hand they are believable because of their uniformity which is it he states the disciples had a quotvigorous unerstanding quot of the sayings of jesus so why in the gospels is jesus constantly having to explain his parables to them greenleaf goes on to claim there was no possible motive for fabrication and that they were quoteminently holy and of tender consciences quot again assumptions are made with no supporting evidence greenleaf does not undertake any kind of fair and rational examination of the evidence some examples of his groundless statements follow quotthat the text of the four evangelists has been handed down to us in the state in which it was originally written that is without having been materially corrputed or falsified either by heretics or christians are facts which we are entitled to assume are true quot how does he know this no support or proof are offered quotit is always to be presumed that men are honest and of sound mind and of the average and ordinary degree of intelligence quot the author also appears very naive another example quotit is quite erroneous to suppose the christian is bound to offer any further proof of their the gospels genuineness or authenticy quot in summary this is an outdated book full of unsupported assumptions it does not offer a serious examination of the gospels by any legal means 
technically excellent but artistically disappointing i was actually fairly disappointed by this book though it does merit very high marks on the technical issues i e the reproductions are of high quality and the photographer knew his tools it s just that i didn t care for the choice of images most of the images are very contrasty moving quickly between almost oily highlights and deep shadows the poses while visually interesting were very artificial and to me unappealing i guess the photographer was going for presenting the structure of the body and different kinds of lines you could generate with it in that regard he did a good job but it was not a goal that appealed to me and one final fyi the book is black and white no value judgement on that just information that i didn t see elsewhere on this page 
what a joke what s wrong with all you amamzon reviewers i actually quite liked shutter island but this was total garbage the morose tone is totally overdone throughout and the end is pathetic the interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story avoid 
waste of time people who enjoy this book seem to characterize it as an original work of sci fifantasy and a thought provoking exploration of insanity which interests me very much however i found this book to be neither original nor an adequate account of someone s descent into or recovery from madness the premise is intriguing enough as the novel begins gradually revealing the story of an amnesiac schizophrenic patient being admitted to a psych ward who turns out to be a professor at cambridge immediately the reader is thrown into pages or so of stream of conciousness ramblings that were quite frankly difficult to trudge through this put a bad taste in my mouth possibly tainting the rest of the book for me the remainder really wasn t terribly interesting i found lessing s writing style to be excruciatingly boring and lacking any sort of insight other reviews of this book tend to fall to the extremes of loving it or hating it i guess that means i hated it so maybe i just didn t get it personally i don t think there was anything to get 
sick twisted i wish i could give this zero stars it is a very dark book and i can t imagine why anyone would write publish gift it or read it there is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk garbage in garbage out ! 
a real disappointment as a human resource professional i was looking for a book that i could use that would help new and emerging managers and executives with their transitions into their new roles this book was a disappointment while some of the points were good and insightful the content could have been covered in a feature length article instead of the book format also the testimonies from the other executives were tedious and unrealistically presented they may all be quite true but the real world does not work in such a straight forward linear fashion with few roadblocks detours or major frustrations i did however get some pithy slogans i can use in my discussions with colleagues while i wait or someone to write the business book summary wait it s been done by the people at get that save your time and you will learn about as much as reading the full length book version i found the first days written by michael watkins to be more practical and actionable than this offering i also am looking forward to goldsmith new book what got you here won t get you there hoping it might be the one i can recommend 
profoundly dishonest the careful reader of the book s footnotes will notice that the author admits to concocting pivotal scenes for dramatic effect such practices are worthy neither of history nor of journalism moreover early in the book the author spins out a series of speculations that somehow transform themselves into assertions of fact by the end of the book that the hero of the book radioed the first warning of the first soviet atomic test that he was ordered by cia to remain where he was that he was sent on a mission to tibet rather than just tried to escape the chinese communists the author also relies far too much on the reminiscences of family members far removed from the scene who of course have an interest perhaps subliminal of sprucing up the story finally the author s animus toward cia and his disagreement with us policy toward tibet drives the narrative often in bizarre ways at one point the hero caught on the tibetan plateau is transformed and transported in time and space to vietnam in the s only to betray that people too ! this is a frustrating book the subject has yet to receive a fair balanced and well researched treatment 
worst book ever this was the worst darn book i ever read i read it last year and never want to read it again it was about a person who turned into an owl and called chinese food food of the gods don t make the mistake of buying or reading this book it was terrible i hated it if you like dumb books definetly buy this 
it just didn t grab me the way i expected i actually read this novel about four years ago and didn t really like it but after reading all the rave reviews on this site i decided to give it another try i came away feeling exactly the same way as before let down the plot never really grabbed me like i thought it would also i never really cared for the character of joe emotionally and physically scared by an abusive father joe grows attached to his foster family and even becomes his adopted father will s personal driver when will is murdered joe decides to uncover the mystery behind his death on his own sounds like it could be interesting huh well seems like most of you have but i just coulded get into this one when it was over i was relieved and that s not a good feeling sorry maybe the third time will be a charm but i don t see myself reading this again just to come away with the same opinion 
worst e e book out there this is easily the worst book in the e e series 
badly written i did not like this book at all lyanka and gitana were both disgustingly perfect beautiful talented fantastic fighters mary sues both of them ick the story was interesting but i found that i just could not get into the book the writing style seemed amateurish it was a slog i was on vacation and i had nothing to do but relax and read this is the sort of situation in which i go through a day this one was so boring that i read it between other much better books i finished it mostly because it was a birthday present the only good thing about this book is the fact that there are many many lines about angel shoving spike up against walls which makes us slashers happy ive read better fanfiction don t waste your money 
dull and plotless while comedian al franken is normally quite humorous this novel was a bit dull there s very little plot and after awhile every page seems like the one before it sure there s the occasional funny part but overall this book is not worth reading quite frankly it s just stupid if it didn t have al s name on the cover it is very doubtful anyone would pick this up if you re looking for something humorous read the idiot girl s guide to action and adventure or the bear went over the mountain 
terrible i guess this is an okay guide if you just want to get the game over with but why would you waste your time doing that this guide misses out on so much i ve found items on my own that weren t even mentioned in the guide the bestiary has no organization and it s still missing many monsters enemies you can tell that they tried to make it in the order that you ll encounter the enemies but many of them can be found before and many of them aren t even listed at all the weapons items and materials information at the end is not detailed enough side areas lacks organizations and it isn t very helpful where is the help on enemy skills on the walkthrough section they don t even tell you the right buttons most of the time not that you need it though the numbering lettering system gets a little bit confusing a lot of their strategies are based on the same party that they like to use not everyone likes to use aeris especially if they have played the game before i could go on and on but i don t want to bore you on a side note the pc version black and white i can t find it anywhere anymore by the same author was so much better everything that this guide lacked was in the pc version except for color but they made that up by having color maps and stuff in the back 
you can find better i have been evaluating and managing corporate marketing for years too much fluff here save your unless you collect branding books 
not a whole lot on homeowners insurance i bought the book thinking that i d be getting detailed information about homeowners insurance but the author merely glosses over the subject matter i think he s an agent and as such doesn t have that much experience when it comes to the information i need such as claims particularly mold since i was just cancelled as a result of filing a mold claim how to interpret specific policy language etc 
sardonic putdowns ruin the content of this book i bought this book thinking it would guide me to fun and funky places to visit that were off the beaten track instead it seemed to be more of an excuse to mock the very places it purported to be interested in the topper was when roadside america described the aviation museum in ohio as if it were a joke when in fact it is a memorable and inspiring museum overall i didn t enjoy the tone of the book which to me seemed to be one of derisive put downs i think many of the places described in this book would be fun to visit but it s hard to pick out the good from the bad with the way this book is written 
extremely disappointing it is hard to express how disappointed i was with divine utterances to reiterate a previous review lets hope that this is not the future of ethnography the personal slant to the writing along with seemingly pointless flowering and embellishing was quite embarassing to read hagedorn comes off as being very self centered i read this is in a seminar and unfortunately all anyone wanted to speak on was the confusing writing style the content of the book was lost in the presentation i would not recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about santeria or afro cuban culture i would perhaps recommend it if you are studying folkorization or performance and wanted a supplementary reference 
throwing the baby out with the bath water this book makes some decent statements however korten goes way overboard on his assault and in doing so ends up throwing the baby out with the bath water what i wish korten would write is warning if we are not careful corporations and the short term goals that they inspire can and will ruin not only the planet but your life and life as we know it but so will any organization that is left unchecked think of and or brave new world for excessive examples of both korten warns that corporations have the potential to be excessive in their quest for greed and that is true however corporations are made of people and if people decide to give their lives over to greed then yes there will be consequences korten never really says this but it is obvious life is more than just work and it is every person s individual responsibility to think about the values of life beyond just simple greed this means i think sharing a healthy passion for improving your position economically in life but also balancing it with other equally important needs love family friends environmental balance love for your neighbor regardless of territorial boundaries etc kortens attack on corporations is excessive and looks at the worst case scenario in every sense and then finds a way to place the blame on business he tells you about all the people that he has seen misplaced over the years due to terrible economic corporate greed however is it just corporations that are at fault here or could it also be politicians local police warlords lack of execution or any other things that could have made a situation bad korten decides that it is the fault of corporations and leaves it at that korten also likes to talk about all of the failures of capitalist societies and how evil greed and pro business leaders caused all of this pain i agree with him that there is no government in the world that is perfect and the us the leader of corporate society has many skeletons in the closet of history but the us history is also one of constant improvement relentlessly seeking to improve the balance between companies individuals and the different elements that make up all of life the robber barons was a chapter of us history that was excessive but it was also one that was ultimately fixed or balanced and after this was done the us not only emerged as one of the strongest economic powers but also a place that immigrants loaded onto boats by the thousands to come to and yes this was a choice that they made no corporation forced them to come korten as well as the first review of this book goes into talking about how even adam smith was opposed to large corporations to quote page smith opposed any form of economic concentration on the ground that it distorts the market s natural ability to establish a price that provides a fair return on land labor and capital this is incorrect what smith opposed was any economic force that led to collusion or manipulation of the markets away from their free workings today free market principles are espoused and they should be when they are not and often times they are not we are dependent on the courts and our elected officials to rectify the problem sometimes this works and sometimes it does not but simply saying that corporations are bad and adam smith says so too is just wrong free market capitalism is a work in progress i could go on but i will give one last example of korten s excess on page he talks about the beliefs of free market ideologues he writes these beliefs are based on a number of explicit underlying assumptions humans are motivated by self interest which is expressed primarily through the quest for financial gain the action that yields the greatest financial return to the individual or firm yields the most benefit to society competitive behavior is more rational for the individual that cooperative behavior and ultimately more beneficial for society human progress and improvements in well being are best measured by increases in the aggregate market value of economic input ok fair enough this seems to be a fair statement in general however kurton then puts his expert opinion on things to work he then interprets all of this in the next paragraph when he says to put it in harsher language these idealogical doctrines assume that people are by nature motivated only by greed the drive to acquire is the highest expression of what it means to be human the relentless pursuit of greed and acquisition lead to socially optimal outcomes the interests of human societies are best served by encouraging honoring and rewarding the above values this jump to harsher langauge is absurd reading this i just cannot see how korten is looking at this with any sort of objective lens to reinterpret the first set of thoughts into the second is just a ridiculous leap and assumes that all people in large corporations must be gordon geckos this type of comparison is made time and time again in this book and is the reason i don t think his arguments can truly hold much weight other that one off examples of corporate ills in the end korten does have some points if you or society or the world cannot understand the difference between economic growth and happiness quality of life then we are all in trouble however i give the world more credit than that it is not a perfect world to say the least but just because there are some problems in certain areas we should not be totally against that area while throwing out the bathwater of economic growth and improving qualities of life let s make sure to hold on to the baby that we are trying to take care of 
am i the only one i read this book many years ago and thought it was terrible looking through the reviews just now i couldn t believe how overwhelmingly positive they were and just had to put in a word for those of us and i assume hope there are others who didn t like the book the book is ludicrously long and meanders through way too many red herrings dead ends and nonsequitirs there are any number of sub plots that appear out of nowhwere go nowhere never pay off and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all the sub plots though are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself it s a very uninspiring story about a business deal will person a get the contract or will person b a business deal who cares spoiler alert and then after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal at the end one of the characters randomly dies and the whole thing just peters out no climax no drama nothing i also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters i found that clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect carried out too far in this book all of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on these are not real people they re supermen who i couldn t relate to at all its boring it s long it s badly written i was particularly disappointed because i loved shogun and liked tai pan and king rat but after this one i ve never read another clavell book and i don t think i will 
discouraging i was disappointed in the contents of the book although some of the information was helpful each chapter ended with how difficult it was to be an independent it consultant also the book is written from a uk perspective and does not focus on many aspects that are specific to the us including new legislation sox or sub contracting 
high expectations bitter disappointment as a prospective brittany owner i have been researching the breed for about months and from the outside quotliving with brittanys a survival guide quot seemed like it would provide me with the essential information i needed to decide whether the breed was right for me sadly i was bitterly disappointed quotliving with brittanys quot is a frustratingly over descriptive self indulgent short story that actually made me angry in parts because of it s non relevance to the subject matter the story itself could have been about any dog and i learned all i needed to know in the last two pages through a bullet pointed list of common brittany traits i wish i had saved both my money and time 
very disappointed wow i hate to go against the tide but i felt very strongly about this book and unfortunately not positively i read this book aloud to my year old daughter as part of our homeschool curriculum and both of our general impressions of this book were similarly negative to the point that we were glad to reach the last page and be done with it we both found the book to be poorly written the plot to be extremely predictable the character development to be lacking the dialog of the characters and the plot line to be unrealistic the character motivations to be unclear and the historical inaccuracies to be glaring the plot was clearly contrived from the very beginning to the end at the final page we were relieved to be through but frustrated that we wasted our time and confused as to all the loose ends left by the author i certainly would not personally recommend this book 
one long ad for nike and brand jordan there is no one in sports that i love more than mj being a bulls fan since the s i still love michael but this book was a supreme disappointment by and large it is an all too detailed history of the design and sales success of his shoes and newer clothing line peppered with michael s passages about being determined and driven which all ring true but have been stated many times before and in better form if you really want to learn about mj i would suggest playing for keeps by david halberstam or the golden boys by cameron stauth which profiles the members of the olympic dream team the profiles on mj and the other team members are probably the best i have read on elite professional athletes if you want some great photos and a book written by mj rare air is much better than this one 
the assassin trail stops at the feet of one murderer lee harvey oswald the late jim garrison s book on the trail of the assassins was in large part the basis for oliver stone s motion picture jfk which is a film containing so many lies half truths and misrepresentations of the facts surrounding john f kennedy s assassination it s literally difficult to keep up with all of them i cannot watch one single scene of oliver stone s film without finding some distortion of the evidence in the real jfk or j d tippit murder cases some are small things being distorted and some are great big ones one example among dozens being oliver stone s version of shoe clerk johnny brewer s testimony re lee harvey oswald s manner of dress when brewer encountered oswald shortly after oswald had shot and killed policeman tippit stone in his film has oswald gary oldman wearing a jacket as he enters the texas theater and is seen by brewer and in one of the movie s deleted scenes on the dvd version of the film kevin costner playing garrison even does a voice over lie re brewer s testimony with costner saying brewer said the man was wearing a jacket brewer in reality said exactly the opposite during his warren commission testimony mr belin will you describe the man you saw mr brewer he was a little man about and weighed about pounds is all and had brown hair he had a brown sports shirt on his shirt tail was out mr belin any jacket mr brewer no another interesting part of the tippit portion of the movie jfk is oliver stone s audio commentary during this part of the film which is riddled with inaccuracies stone has the audacity to spout the following lie re the tippit shooting on the dvd s commentary soundtrack not one credible witness has really identified oswald as a single shooter of officer tippit in fact the only significant testimony applies two to three shooters o stonetherefore per mr stone and garrison said pretty much the same thing years earlier the only credible witness must have been acquilla clemmons who as far as i am aware was the only witness who ever said there was more than one person involved in the tippit slaying stone like jim garrison before him would simply rather believe his own version of events rather than the multiple witnesses who never saw more than one shooter with that one single shooter being positively identified as oswald by said witnesses its interesting indeed that stone thinks the only significant testimony re the tippit crime came from clemmons whereas people like markham tatum and scoggins who were all closer than clemmons to the scene of the murder are deemed less significant merely no doubt because they don t fit into stone s or garrison s ct landscape surrounding the murder i wonder if people realize just how many outright lies are contained in oliver stone s hour minute motion picture the number is simply staggering and that number of distortions is increased considerably on the dvd version of the film when the audio commentary track by mr stone and all of the deleted and extended scenes are included as well and a great deal of this deliberate misinformation put forth on the movie screen came directly out of this book authored by jim garrison another great place to see more of mr garrison s skewed views of the jfk case is to read garrison s playboy magazine interview like stone s movie that playboy article will keep you busy as you try to keep up with the inaccurate things garrison keeps saying in that lengthy piece the whole interview can be read here wwwjfklancercomgarrisonhtmlselected examples of mr garrison s paranoia and loony toon conspiracy talk taken from that playboy interview are provided via the quotes below my own rebuttal arguments follow each quote though he oswald may not have known why he was instructed to do so this was undoubtedly why he got the job at the texas school book depository building the conspirators knew this would place him on the scene and convince the world that a demented marxist was the real assassin jim garrison the above garrison gem totally distorts or just flat out ignores the true and documented facts about how oswald got his job at the depository in mid october of it was suburban dallas housewives linnie mae randle and ruth paine who were directly responsible for placing lee harvey oswald in the tsbd by way of ordinary garden variety happenstance garrison must therefore believe that mrs paine who arranged oswald s job interview with depository boss roy truly was one of the main conspirators who was setting up oswald to take the fall for jfk s murder the following month which would also have to mean that paine had detailed knowledge of the president s motorcade route more than a month before november garrison must also think that roy truly was a big part of the patsy plot because it was mr truly who actually hired oswald even though nobody was holding a shotgun to truly s head forcing him to hire lee the commonly held belief that lee oswald was placed in the texas school book depository by evil plotters prior to is a desperate attempt by cters like mr garrison to attach unprovable and unsupportable conspiratorial strings to a random event that involved several individuals individuals whose collective and synchronized actions could not possibly have been foreseen and controlled by a group of behind thescenes conspirators anyone who takes the time to read the warren report will find that of the witnesses in dealey plaza who were able to assess the origin of the shots almost two thirds said they came from the grassy knoll area in front and to the right of the presidential limousine and not from the book depository jim garrison this is pure nonsense there were indeed several witnesses who said they heard shots coming from in front of jfk s car but garrison has severely skewed the stats to support his claim of knoll shooters his almost two thirds figure is not even close to being accurate when talking about the number of witnesses who said they heard frontal shots and even amongst other cters virtually no other pro conspiracy author has ever rigged those stats in such an out ofwhack manner the fact is that more than half of all earwitnesses heard shots coming from the direction of the book depository and not from the knoll and an even more illuminating statistic reveals that less than of all earwitnesses heard shots from more than just a single general location front vs rear that stat speaks volumes because even cters admit to some rear shots an interesting tabulation of this data can be found below httpmcadamsposcmueduimagesshotsjpghttpmcadamsposcmueduearwitnesseshtmthe second shot struck the president in the back the location of this wound can be verified not by consulting the official autopsy report but by perusing the reports filed by two fbi agents who were present at the president s autopsy both stated unequivocally that the bullet in question entered president kennedy s back and did not continue through his body jim garrison therefore mr garrison is in essence saying that he is much more likely to trust the word of fbi agents who of course were not doctors and were not conducting the president s autopsy rather than take the word of the three physicians who each signed the official autopsy report after all why believe the autopsy doctors when you could just trust as gospel the word of a bystander sarcasm alert plus why didn t these two fbi agents get the conspirators memo which if cters are right about the success of the patsy plot must have been passed out to nearly everyone in officialdom on a memo that probably said attn all agents we re framing oswald tomorrow so remember to falsify as much evidence as humanly possible to ensure conviction of patsy evidently some people who needed to see it never received that important document we have also located another man who was not involved in the shooting but created a diversionary action in order to distract people s attention from the snipers this individual screamed fell to the ground and simulated an epileptic fit drawing people away from the vicinity of the knoll just before the president s motorcade reached the ambush point jim garrison yet another outright lie from the lips of district attorney garrison the man who had the so called simulated epileptic fit was fully identified by the fbi on may his name was jerry belknap a man who had a history of epilepsy since childhood belknap also proved to the fbi that he had paid the ambulance bill after he was taken to parkland hospital president kennedy was killed for one reason because he was working for a reconciliation with the u ssr and castro s cuba his assassins were a group of fanatic anti communists with a fusion of interests in preventing kennedy from achieving peaceful relations with the communist world jim garrison any solid verifiable proof of such accusations mr garrison any physical evidence whatsoever that shows jfk was killed by more than one gun the answers to those two questions are no and no but the lack of physical evidence never stopped a hard boiled cter thats been proven over and over again by a vast assortment of conspiracists who have more theories up their sleeve than a dog has fleas in summation there were at least five or six shots fired at the president from front and rear by at least four gunmen assisted by several accomplices at this stage of events lee harvey oswald was no more than a spectator to the assassination perhaps in a very literal sense james altgens snapped a picture that shows a man with a remarkable resemblance to oswald standing in the doorway of the depository the altgens photograph indicates the very real possibility that at the moment oswald was supposed to have been shooting kennedy he may actually have been standing outside the front door watching the motorcade i don t believe that oswald shot anybody on november nd not the president and not tippit jim garrison it seems as though these devilishly clever conspirators forgot one important thing when they were setting up lho they forgot their brains for who with brains would allow their lone patsy to casually drift outside and be photographed and seen by countless witnesses when the plotters need to have lee harvey on the th floor at per mr garrison s account of oswald possibly being doorway man evidently the real assassins were indeed brainless and lacked the common sense to keep oswald where he wouldn t be able to establish a credible alibi for his whereabouts just think about these garrison remarks for a moment longer too at least five or six shots were fired at the president from front and rear by at least four gunmen doesnt a shooter shot patsy assassination plot seem a bit unlikely to anyone else but this writer would any professional killers actually attempt to frame a lone fall guy in that type of overkill fashion in my opinion no pro hit men would go about the complicated task of setting up oswald or anybody else in such a needlessly reckless way a single pro hit man could have easily killed jfk with one or two shots probably just one from oswald s nest without the need to clog the works with needless back up gunmen hiding all around dealey plaza there is no possible way the conspirators could have ensured the success of a multi shooter plot to frame just oswald in the minutes during and after the shooting no way there are way too many uncontrollable factors that could block the success of that one patsy venture that jim garrison placed his faith in uncontrollable items such as a frontal shooter might very well have been seen by witnesses and to think that every witness under the sun could be easily bought taken care of and or coerced by these plotters is again just too much wishful thinking on the conspirators part imo a frontal shooter might strike other occupants in the car or strike somebody else in dealey plaza but even if only kennedy is hit by a frontal gunman there are massive problems to be corrected by the conspirators bullets to be hidden and of course who knows how many obvious frontal wounds on the victim to be somehow eliminated and eliminated immediately before any non conspirators can spill any beans only a person straight out of the booby hatch could believe that anyone regardless of power or pull could get away with such a thing it s just plain loony the one patsy oswald could have easily by pure accident and happenstance established a perfect alibi for himself at the time when he was supposed to be on the th floor shooting the president as mr garrison apparently did think occurred with oswald being seen in a photo taken as the bullets were flying even though all reasonable researchers know full well that doorway man was actually billy lovelady and not oswald lovelady even testified to that effect in plus if oswald had really been in that doorway at why on earth didn t he say he was there if he s got an ironclad alibi like that why wouldn t he use it instead he says not a word about being outside on the steps at and even tells the police a provable lie re his whereabouts the lie about having lunch with junior jarman at the time of the shooting how much sense does that make if oswald had really been in the depository doorway and the very fact that oswald did not have a usable provable alibi for exactly pm is absolutely remarkable if he had really been wandering around on the lower floors of the depository or was outside the building as many cters firmly believe and even the most rabid of conspiracy theorists have got to admit that from the ctpatsy pov oswald s not having a usable believablesolid alibi is certainly by far the biggest piece of luck in the whole patsy plot these amazing patsy plotters just lucked out evidently in that oswald was not seen by a single person inside or outside the tsbd at precisely the time of the assassination except by howard brennan ron fischer and robert edwards of course who saw oswald or a nicely arranged oswald imposter in the sniper s nest at or just seconds before and the likelihood that all of the non tsbd bullets are going to somehow get swept under the rug is extremely remote especially in a bob groden like scenario mr groden per his book the killing of a president incredibly has zero of the shots coming from the oswald window and a total of up to ten shots being fired and all of them coming from rifles other than the one rifle these idiot plotters are going to attempt to frame oswald with ! could groden s scenario be any more reckless and preposterous i doubt it and a biggie that most cters evidently don t think could have ever happened before on november nd the one patsy mr lho could get wise to the plot that is brewing all around him and take measures to guarantee he could never be blamed for the actual assassination of john kennedy when thinking about any frame lee oswald as the one patsy plan i just cannot visualize any professional assassins even for a minute contemplating the use of multiple shooters let alone some gunmen firing from the grassy knoll i e the exact opposite direction from where their single dupe is supposed to be located as the previously mentioned quotes from the mouth of mr garrison amply demonstate if anyone has a desire to set out on the trail of a lunatic conspiracy theorist look no further than earling carothers jim garrison 
boo hiss this book was disappointing it s title lead me to believe that it would be an extensive and thorough compilation of most if not all of the bikes schwinn produced not so i own a schwinn twinn tandem bike and was hoping i would read and see information on tandems they picture one tandem and have very little information about it they also fail to depict several other models if you look at an orignal schwinn catalog you ll find that they built dozens of models each year ! do a google search and you ll find it one of schwinn s more popular models was the typhoon and i don t even see a mention of it ! what a crock i have a standard catalog of corvette and it s is much more thorough than this one for the bike 
how the mighty are fallen i m afraid very afraid for the preston child team i loved their early books and recommended them to countless friends but their latest offerings specifically brimstone and its sequel the book of the dead show signs of too much fame and too much formula they re writing less well and they re trying to write blockbusters hoping i imagine for that booty call from hollywood significant portions of both brimstone and botd are set in italy and we know what that means don t we it means weve caved in to pressure from agents publisherssatan and decided to try to shove our way onto dan brown s overcrowded coattails it s a little bit sickening really in books like thunderhead and mount dragon you felt you were in the hands of someone who knew the territory he was describing knew it inside and out and could take you there p c s italy is generic google search lonely planet italy sure they ve been there who hasn t but it isn t what they really know well and the result is a warmed over hash of italian sterotypes and shibboleths that make you shake your head in disappointment doug lincoln why d you do it brimstone isn t a terrible book though there are at least a half dozen particulars of the central mystery that the authors never explain or wrap up what s terrible is that it s like other assembly line thrillers and their books once upon a time were unique now that the wal martization of the preston child franchise is nearly complete i worry that there s going to be less and less reason to keep shopping here 
form over function the language is beautiful in form inspirational is the best way to describe his ability to describe any one moment the internal mechanisms that move a story from one moment to the next is what was painfully absent the main driving force of plot was overt sexual tension once this aspect had reached its climax early in the novel there was little holding my attention i put the book down not knowing what became of the chink or any of the cowgirls is literature supposed to have a point or not there are works of art that are beauty in of themselves and only for themselves and represent a voice that was never heard of before then there are pieces of art and literature whose point is to edify through illustration explanation or even catharis this work was absent of any meaningful satire that i could discern robbin s strength here was in his unique way of illustrating with words i believe an earlier reviewer used the words literary masturbation perfect discription sadly this was my first exposure to t robbins doubt if i will try again any time soon i do get cinemax afterall 
help i keep falling asleep reading this book i have always loved the kinsey millhone series they used to be fun and entertaining but this book is different it just can t keep my attention the story may be authentic but is so thin that it could have been written in maybe pages at the most the filler story is boring to the point it puts me to sleep descriptions of clothes meals surroundings you name it anyting are so totally unnecessary and actually get silly if it wasn t so annoying too bad i ll think twice before buying an other sue grafton 
grrr mars and venus together forever is one of the most ridiculous stupid books that i have ever had the gross misfortune to read i probably should have expected what i got considering that mars and venus on a date left me cold but i read this one anyway because the original mars and venus book had some interesting insights and i m a sucker for a cheap book anyone who buys into the stereotypes promoted by john gray must be barmy he exaggerates overemphasises and blusters his way through the pages probably with the best motives in his mind but in the end the stuff he writes is uninspiring and insipid according to him men and women are still ruled by ancient traditions which dictate that women are all do gooder types who only desire to stay at home chatting with other women and looking at flowers whilst men are all aggressive cavemen grunting their way through their lives with zero finesse a beer in one hand and the tv remote in the other i don t see how anyone man or woman could read this book without being annoyed for women the book is terribly unempowering if you don t fit in with any of gray s ideas about what a woman should be then you are labelled as masculine i don t want to read a book which tells me that when i am at work i am moving towards my masculine side because being goal oriented competitive and efficient are male traits it s all phooey ! for men the book is also offensive john gray says that men shouldn t express their feelings because it will cause a woman to lose her attraction for him no i don t believe that men and women are the same in all respects there are gender differences but in mars and venus these are distorted overall this book is not worth your time underneath the waffle there may be some good points but all of these are outweighed by the stereotypes joann 
definitely not for beginners like another reviewer i had a hard time following these recipes many ingredients are given in hindi for example brinjal or hing powder i know that it is possible to google these things but it s still an unexpected nuisance additionally the chapters run right into each other without a break there is no index there are pictures of dishes but you d be hard pressed to find the actual dishes because no index i believe that many measurements are also off as an example the rice pudding recipe calls for cups milk and tablespoons of rice many recipes call for cup of vegetables erm i have no doubt that the book was originally published with metric units and converted unsuccessfully to english units some day there will be a nice book for non indians on south indian food until then i think i ll have better luck with recipes from the internet 
disappointment the only reason i made it through this book is because it was our book club choice for the month otherwise i would have quit after the first chapter i found the girl s thought patterns unrealistic for a girl of the plot of story develpment was very weak it didn t ripen until the very last few chapters by that time i was so sick of the repetitious story line i skimmed through it just so i could finish it the language was very rich and descriptive but with such a boring story line who cares i m glad to be done with it ! 
other methods meanwhile a lot of other people written very good books in a very different stile suzanne clothier bones would rain from the sky patricia mcconnell the other end of the leash turid rugaas calming signals we have three irish setter and we prefer a soft method for our dogs 
not worth the paper it is printed on i did not like the book which is fundamentally flawed from the concept and proposition sorry to have wasted my time going through it 
slow start set the pace this book started off slow and i read about of the book until i was interested in the story at all while the writing is very descriptive the author does not engage the reader by developing empathy for the characters not recommended 
not for me you can find all the information and more this book provides on the internet so if you have a little time to search the web you don t need this book and it doesn t answer all the questions you may have you still need the help of a lactation consultant or your baby s doctor so if you have more problems than mastitis and engorgement this book won t help you 
mcjihad vs reality this book is inexplicably influential probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis instead delivering an exasperating page long list of every single thing on earth that he disagrees with barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass culture sameness interestingly barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance using each other s excesses as excuses for their anti democratic behavior that is a fascinating thesis which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating the first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists of cultural trends that barber disdains in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary it s all tied together with attempts at edgy pop culture references made up terminology like the annoying infotainment telesector and pseudo intellectual quotations and namedropping all is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term mcworld which is so vague and all inclusive as to become meaningless in his never ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days or both in the second part of the book barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation states his umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term jihad note that this book was published back in so that word was not as prevalent in western discourse as it is now but barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout muslims and ardent anti islamistswhen it comes to the specifics many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in barber s arguments and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task you can agree or disagree with various critiques of barber s contentions based on your own personal politics but everyone will probably conclude that in this book s final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis embodied in the book s title and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector overall this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know itall who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world doomsdayer 
very biased and anti communist propaganda book i m not a big fan of communism nor of stalin but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war dont waste your money on a propaganda book better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer thats what biographies are supposed to be 
caution other reviews i would give this book but you can t give half stars it had to be rather than because i think all the other reviews are written by the writer s mates the book has some value but is poorly structure spends too much time talking about standard screenwriting form and illustrates points inadequately pointing to only a few films to make each point 
working moms don t bother i was so excited when i bought this book dispair set in once i disovered the focus was on stay at home moms of very young children i couldn t get past all of the examples of the trails and tribulatiions of quotnew moms quot to focus on the balancing act of working moms 
too drawn out normally i don t take the time to write a review but this book just bugged me when i finished i felt like i had run a marathon the book was just too drawn out and i felt the descriptions were long winded faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem the plot was good but moved slowly i am typically not drawn to danielle steel books and probably with good reason that i never seem to like them very much i am glad that this book was in a box of books that i paid for at a used book store i would have felt like i wasted my money had i actually paid full price for it 
attention to detail sometimes a distraction as far as crime dramas go this is firmly mediocre the story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically but the author s writing style is sometimes a distraction why do the african american suspects always ask for slice soda to drink and they repeatedly make a point of asking for slice do they even make it anymore i thought it was replaced by sierra mist and another distracting detail is the author s way of giving so many people nicknames you don t need to tell me that a guy s name is ed smiley jones if you never mention smiley again or there s not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname that said i liked the use of dc as the backdrop and if i was going on a plane ride i would probably pick up another book by pelecanos but i wouldn t let anyone see what i was reading and then i d leave it in the seatback when i deplaned 
blah blah blah blah too much talk not enough action this book is putting me to sleep ! i bought it a few days ago and have spent that entire time reading i m more of a visual learner usually the tyid books are very hands on so far this one is harshly hands off how can i be expected to remember all this information i need examples not just charts it doesn t look like its going to get any better later in the text i ve scanned through the book several times wondering when this terribly detailed nonsense will end and from what i ve seen it continues through the entire book yawn 
tedious and boring and self centered oh my gosh this book starts out tedious and self centered and just gets worse with each page when the guy describes how he throws a rock to kill a rabbit just to see if he could i stopped reading 
unrealistic repetitive couldn t finish this book was interesting at first it shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like but that only takes a chapter after that it just keeps repeating itself over and over who do you think bought the watch and who bought the lower priced watch yeah yeah i get it the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending no real wealth guy then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point i want real examples i don t care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity but don t come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn t real then there is the advice on being frugal i am pretty frugal but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if i had to live like that sure i could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget but then i wouldn t be very happy who cares if i have a million when i m ish if i had to live miserably up until then what is that worth i know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car but driving around my year old jeep is no fun either this book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender people with common sense need not buy this book just check it out at the library like i did 
title misleading there was hardly any mention of pixel the cat it was alot of dialog tried to resemble a fast paced action book but i found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while for a female i like action and for the plot to move along there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging and multiple partner sex i felt like the over tone to the book was well ok we all have alot of sex with lots of different people in the future it was too focused on that i liked stranger in a strange land alot better by the time i was through with this book i kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page 
the book description says it all as an african american gay man gomes is interested in re viewing the biblical passages on sexuality and race without even picking up this book you can see where it is going the bible clearly speaks out against the homosexual lifestyle strike those passages the bible is god s word and ought to read as such not reinterpreted to make us feel better about our sin by the way being named one of the best seven preachers by time magazine is like being named one of the best seven republicans by moveon org it doesn t hold much authority read a decent translation of the bible for yourself and see what god has to say to you 
only for d students i will tell you why i did not read this book the back cover shows it is unnecessary by telling you every single tip you will get to know in this book the tips are so simple too simple you will wonder how this guy even managed to make a book out of tips your teachers and your parents have told you a billion times if you are a d student this book will help you by telling you to start working instead of writing notes to your girlfriend boyfriend of day and plans to break up just read the back cover and write down what you plan of doing if you are a a b student go home a poster can do the job of this book another problem would be that since this tips are so simple you may not have the attension span to read every atom of a detail behind it

god hater s book think carefully before buying this trilogy is indeed diabolical the temptation a captivating nicely written story but beware of the message the world view that the book is advocating is that god is really an evil angel that is just pretending to be the creator the devil s revolt was actually the work of good angels god only does bad things the enemies of god also do bad things like intentionally killing children but they should be forgiven because they are working for the good cause of killing god there is absolutely no discussion or attempt to show a different viewpoint the evils of the church are the evils of god period i guess that a lot of people missed these points because they are skillfully camouflaged in a truly imaginative story ! but be carefull ! messages work on your subconscious reasoning if you don t think about them rationally analyze the message carefully i read to the very end hoping that there was going to be some discussion or debate but no this is a bigoted narrow minded hateful worldview that is pretending to be humanistic it is presenting half truth in order to make the rational plausible all the bad things people have done in the name of god was god s fault and the good things they have done are not even mentioned if you think this is just a bit of harmless fun and should not be taken seriously be careful the story is indeed very imaginative and captivating which makes it even more evil if you hate god this is the book for you ps it is really funny to see religious people making such a fuss over harry potter which is a truly moral story when there are abominations like this one around this book openly preaches god hatred ! which is different from just not believing in god this book states god exists but he is evil i don t believe in banning any books but i am very very sorry i spent my money on this book 
hypocrisy writ large describing the democratic party as the party of death is classic phony con propaganda designed to attract attention without engaging in intelligent debate the notion that the republican party is prolife is one of the greatest scams ever perpetrated on the american public republicans support the death penalty and the iraq war which has caused the deaths of thousands of americans and thousands of non combatant iraqi civilians as governor of texas george w bush presided over more state sponsored executions than any governor in the history of the united states this included people who were determined by medical experts unanimously to be mentally retarded and incapable of understanding their actions or the punishment that awaited them so much for respecting life it is also a blatant lie to claim that abortion is the central theme of the democratic party democrats stand for freedom of choice in all aspects of life they stand for the rights of individuals to live their lives without interference from an unchecked government and religious zealots that is the fundamental premise on which the united states was founded anyone who wants to understand the true impact of legalized abortion without a lot of hateful name calling should read freakonomics by levitt dubner let thinking feeling americans consign ponnuru to the garbage can where he belongs 
the protection of the remnant petra of all places supernatural protection persecution on ad naseum the one drug on and on and on and on same tired story persecution by carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies sorry i think the series denegrates christianity rather then exalting it i ve read all and found it morose and condemning the opposite of how i view christianity is 
grad student s review i am a graduate student at asu this book is part of the required course materials since montgomery is affiliated with asu the quality of this textbook is what you may find in a mediocre statistics book i have not seen statistics dealt with in a more confusing manner explanations are incomplete graphs meant to illustrate concepts are not labeled symbols and functions are used without defining them and there are errors in the examples my understanding was that d montgomery has been in this field for a long time however basic principles like including units with the data are ignored i expected by the th attempt these problems would have been worked out the other reviews do not make sense to me since my classmates feel a similar frustration with the book 
insidious and i use the word in its strictest sense more harmful than is apparent the only reason esposito has been able to rise to the heights of his profession is basically because his audience consists either of muslims who approve of all the congratulatory things he says about islam or americans who simply don t know one way or the other and naturally would like to believe his drivel about the peaceful religion notice that his audiences never consist of those nonmuslims who haved lived and traveled in the middle east who speak and read arabic who have read the koran or who have dealt with muslims and arabs for years such people invariably revile esposito and would promptly laugh him off stage still it s interesting how someone can study a subject academically for all his life and never really see it for a useful analysis of islam without rose colored glasses robert spencer david pryce jones thomas friedman victor davis hanson serge trifkovic bat ye or daniel pipes even bernard lewis if you must 
not the best i would have to say that i don t particularly agree with this book i mean in my opinion the most important thing about an apple is that it is food not that it is round regardless it did provide for an interesting conversation in my nd grade class as well as a fun get toknowyou activity after reading the book disucssing differing view points each student created a page about the most important thing about me is 
self indulgence i think hemingway wanted to do two things critique certain aspects of how wwii was fought particularly the politicalization of battle plans and pay homage to his beloved venice to do so he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age the plot to the extent there is one and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story the bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about venice locales architecture food markets layout and of course the canals and a journalist s rants about us generals in wwii diehard hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read others should stay away 
overly broad too generic for me mr edwards book needs some updating also it s a very general look at the real estate field it s a little too broad mr edwards does not go into great detail in any chapter and he basically just gives an overview of a career in real estate i would tag this book as more a choosing a career resource book something someone might read if they are thinking about real estate and know absolutely nothing about it if you are definately going into real estate buy a different book this isn t for you most of what is in the book is so basic anyone who has ever bought a home knows the material ie he explains what a closing is what a downpayment is etc sorry but most people already know what those terms mean the beginning of the book takes up so much time on choosing a broker etc again more of a choosing a career handbook i was expecting more of a howto be a successful realtor book i wanted ideas and suggestions on what to do after getting my license to attract clients get listings etc you won t find any of that in this book sorry 
absence of content it is rare to see an author tackle such a rich and interesting subject and write a book so vapid and lacking in content the material is quotexplainedquot in terms of inept metaphors and vague hand waving assertions after devoting several hours to studying the book the reader has the feeling that he s quotbeen had quot since he has acquired nothing in return for his effort in fact the author appears to have no more than the faintest grasp of the subject he is writing about 
one of lightman s lesser works if you have read reunion or einsteins dreams you ll be quite upset with this novel it seems rather limited in its scope and is lacking metaphor like lightman s other works he has developed as a writer since this book however don t let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels 
british sensibilities save your money or if you need to spend it buy plain yogurt you will find the bland white stuff much more exciting than this novel if you do buy this book you will wade through pages and pages waiting for the story to get started and then you will not care about a single character you meet in the course of the book there are love affairs savage beatings and a kidnapping or two and all these incidents unfold without an ounce of passion desire or emotion anna the long suffering wife is so strangled that she can t bring herself to demand a new washing machine she and her obtuse husband never talk to each other or to their children and we are supposed to care about the marriage of these two buy yogurt 
where are the first stories i bought a dog eared copy of this collection quottrouble is my business quot at a book sale for a year ago the copy i have is thick with stories i bought this copy of quottrouble is my business quot to have a better copy but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four marlowe stories my question is what the hell happened to the first and why is amazon com still describing this as a collection of when there are merely four that s not jake fellas 
great plot poor delivery it s summer and my reading matter always lightens up significantly ! i spotted this book at the library and figured why not ! i know i said never again for danielle steel but the plot interested me how bad could it be right well there s good news and bad news the good news is that the plot is different for ds and held my interest enough so that unlike impossible i actually finished it in one day the bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing the repetition is maddening when reading becomes a chore and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything it s time to start some serious editing here are some suggested areas of improvement shorten up the paragraphs they should not exceed a page try spending a little more time developing the characters i couldn t see sarah when i read i want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages i never had a clear vision of the main character pay attention to style every time she spelled out i wanted to pull my hair out small thing but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence as i ve written before ds needs a good editor this book could have been one of her best to date 
not as sweet as i d hoped a recipe for bees reminded me a lot of the novel vinegar hill in both stories a wife is living in a dark unpleasant home environment in a recipe for bees augusta an older lady approaching the end of her life reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage her mother dies at a young age leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father when she meets karl and they become married augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another living at karl s father s farm augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life the rest of the novel delves into augusta s search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life the story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage being a misfit in the community and mother daughter relationships the main problem reading it is that i couldn t find it in me to like the main character augusta i also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like the weaving of the quotbeequot theme added a nice touch to the story but if you re looking for a great read with a quotbeequot them try the secret life of bees by sue monk kidd the writing in a recipe for bees was good but i felt the story was lacking something 
the dating game i did not like this audio book out of all of danielle steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story in a world of finding a new job and starting to date again it was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man it tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again 
inexplicable i couldn t even get through this novel documenting the rock n roll industry and band dynamics is undoubtedly a difficult task some have done it successfully others have not unfortunately the anomalies falls in the latter category goebels novel told from multiple point ofviews a al faulkner s as i lay dying could have been intersting but let s be honest here and cut right to the novel s central problem how many bands have an year old sex starved granny an year old girl an effeminate iraqi soldier and a satan worshipping teenager the novel loses any credibility because its initial premise completely unbelievable and head scratching there s simply no way these people would ever get together much less form a band i m growing tired of writers who assume they have to have quirky and offbeat characters to make novels interesting quirky characters more often than not make for obnoxious and annoying characters and does little more than display an author s inability at novelizing complex human emotions and relaitionships unfortunately the united nations esque freak show band is little more than a gimmick and a tired one at that the writing itself is mediocre at best goebel s still a young man and it shows most of the prose comes across as juvenile and simplistic probably because it is it never really sparkles never really reveals anything substantial about the plot or characters the dialogue is ordinary and by thebook the quirky characters are by and large one dimensional stereotypes and the shifting p ov could have been interesting had the band member s observations about each other amounted to anything insightful or interesting it takes a lot for me to give up on a book way through it but of the anomolies was an uninspired tedious exercise in band dynamics a major disappointment 
unauthenticated foolishness with some good tangents while the ancillary material on cryptid hominids is well organized representing a reasonably clean presentation of typically widely scattered material the lion s share of the book is valueless for one simple reason not one claim is substantiated it would indeed justify rewriting human history were a machined steel component unearthed in an ordovician matrix or a precisely carved stone tool found embedded in mesozoic strata yet despite the copious bibliography there is not one footnote associating any of the outrageous claims with a verifiable published source beyond that some of the claims are just plain silly for example i have trouble seeing through the authors eyes how a vaguely dumbbell shaped outline in archaic shale is ironclad evidence that a shod human foot walked past in remote times mine the internet for the useful cryptid material and save your money otherwise 
lazy and lame book i ordered this based largely on the concept which seemed like a book on gay history that was much needed to fill in the gaps instead the book comes off as if kaiser got a nice advance and then needed to submit some kind of manuscript but he had lots of other things to do so he did the absolute minimal amount of new research instead he relies heavily on taped interviews with or gay men to fill out the pages the chapter on the s one of the most important decades in gay history has nothing more than former bartenders saying that the mineshaft was wild man and a politico friend of his talking about how he semi came out of the closet no sense of the gay metropolis here just a random series of unconnected anecdotes i hope he got a nice advance but this book isn t really worth actually buying just check it out at the library in all its dismalness and see for yourself 
sensitive types highly sensitive people hsps are already sensitive to the role a book like this can play in their ability to take an active approach to self understanding once one s status as an hsp is established by way of this book s sensitively provided self tests the book then goes on to provide the tools to categorise one s sensitivity type st even further the rude and insensitive sector of the population raips would no doubt be surprised to learn that there are several types of hsp with different levels of sensitivity depending on the life domain introverted creative sociable and worried hsps everywhere will be grateful to have these tools at their fingertips to increase the depth of their self awareness on the hsp scale my own self awareness journey however has been hampered from the beginning by the gaudy colouring of this book s pink and yellow striped cover with bright green and red overlaid font can t the publishers provide a version of the book suitable for highly photosensitive types like myself we hpsps are too often undervalued and ignored by the hsp community in general 
quite a surprise i went to the library with my year old son and just grabbed the book we have read pinkerton stories and have always loved them and i didn t even look through the book or even much at the cover until that night when we settled in for night time stories i then realized that there was a quotrobberquot with a gun on the cover i thought to myself quothow did i not see this before quot and by then it was too late my son saw it and had a zillion questions so we read it i was shocked by the content ! we are very open with our son about anything he asks and i explained that yes there are quotrobbersquot and yes people do get into dangerous situations like that i felt very uncomfortable having to almost outright lie to him and tell him that quotno noone will break into our house because we lock our doors etc quot how else do you explain this to a yo at bedtime we got through it and son loved the book i thought it was very cute that pinkerton was confused but could have done without the break in part i feel it could have been as cute without that very irresponsible in a child s book but i guess i learned a lesson to read the books before we check them out even when they are written by someone you consider quotsafequot 
heart healthy excellent book gives background information about a heart healthy diet and some excellent recipes i love it 
there s no future in murray s dreaming this book came highly recommended to me with all the hype surrounding its apparent genius i expected to be blown away sadly though this book comes across as someone who has just played a video game for the first time myst and decided that the kids might be on to something murray proclaims that one day in the distant future they ll make a holodeck and we ll finally have true immersion in the mean time we can gloss over all the interactive components that make such an experience compelling in the first place the future of gaming narratologyludology whatever youwanttocallit is already here you don t need a vr suit or some imaginary technology to have a truly immersive experience her woefully uninformed look at the games of her day are completely inexcusable interactors will be lured into worlds where they float tumble and arc through thrillingly coloured spaces fly through imaginary clouds and swim lazily across welcoming mountain ponds the nightmare landscape of the fighting maze in which we feel imperiled may give way to enchanting worlds of increasingly refined visual dealight that are populated by evocative fairy tale creatures at the time of this book s publishing games such as jumping flash mario and tomb raider had already taken the world by storm by reducing contemporary gaming to mindless juvenile violence while championing those themes in war peace hamlet and star trek murray shows a complete lack of interest and imagination the heavy hand of narrative is not the only way to tell a story we don t need a cyberdramatist the likes of a dickens or a shakespeare to show us the way she could have explored the work of miyamoto wright or kojima and the stories that arise out those gaming experiences instead she focuses on the miller brothers because they offered up the most conventional form of storytelling eight years on their impact is almost forgotten above all people want to act not in the theatrical sense but in the name of imaginative play maybe someday she ll prove us all wrong and the dr quinn holodeck will sweep us up in the rapturous joy of existing in a town populated by blacksmiths barbers general store owners saloon keepers scouts and of course female doctors and who could be given their own homesteads or boardinghouse rooms in particular physical locations within the fictional world sounds like fun criticism aside i did enjoy the chapter elizas daughters murray s look at procedural characters and believable agents proved informative and intriguing if only the rest of the book were as objective and plausible then i might actually believe the hype surrounding hamlet on the holodeck 
a book to make its readers angry for the wrong reasons i found the whole woman more antagonistic and needlessly controversial than enlightening greer makes it quite clear that there is exactly one feminist left on the planet and she is it im hard pressed to think of any third wave feminists who live up to her standards to do so you would have to be an earth mother living in a separatist commune with her lesbian lover there s nothing wrong with that lifestyle but it s not one to which most feminists would aspire it s not one to which i aspire also it s as limiting a construction of womanhood as the patriarchal one she deplores what do you do if you are heterosexual it s all very well for her to say that you can reconstruct yourself as a lesbian but that s as insulting as the implication that homosexuals just need to try hard enough and they can be heterosexual in a similar vein i found her views of men particularly unpleasant she suggests in no uncertain terms that they re all potential adulterers rapists child abusers wife beaters misogynists etc etc and that any woman who wants an equal non exploitative relationship had better become a lesbian it s hard to see it as anything but pure slander backed up by the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence just because you can cite a few cases of sickos who get turned on by their baby daughters in their nightgowns does not mean that all fathers will inevitably turn to abuse the rest of the book is no better it s very poorly researched and argued and parts of it verge into the insane she seems particularly taken with the idea of primitive women as whole women because they aren t bound by western concepts of femininity what she doesn t mention is that those women experience the same oppression that western feminists fought long and hard to overcome they might not wear bras or high heels but that doesn t make them any less oppressed by patriarchy it seems obvious to me that women from tribal societies do not generally have much real political power but are doomed to bear lots of children and die young when she does look at the appalling aspects of those societies she puts a positive spin on them there s even a section where she seems to defend female genital mutilation also i can imagine that some of her ill informed views are extremely offensive to people in those situations she describes ivf as patriarchal appropriation of and interference into the process of reproduction similarly she suggests that women who don t opt for natural childbirth without anaesthetic of course are allowing men to remove them from the process it s utterly disrespectful of the choices women may choose to make not because they ve internalised their oppression but because inseminating themselves with a turkey baster seems vaguely ludicrous or because they don t want to experience agonising pain its been a while since i read a feminist book that made me angry and this one does so for all the wrong reasons it makes me embarrassed to call myself a feminist 
the time machine well the time machine was an ok book it could have been better wells does a great job at describing the future from his view point high points in the book were chapters through thats where the time traveller goes to the year and meet carnivorous creatures called morlocks one thing i did like about the book is the epilouge after chapter saying that the time traveller never came back it was a great cliffhanger all in all the time machine is an ok book i strongly recommend this book to h g wells fans 
this book sucks i hate this book it is extremely boring and it is way too long there are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar do not read this unless forced to i like to read but this nearly put me to sleep avoid at all cost 
not as good as i expected my house was a total loss after a fire i needed info on home insurance so i got this book big disappointment no help at all i then got another book on amazon titled mold fire flood other topics homeowners insurance explained great book i recommend it 
sophomoric and sloppy i ll preface this by saying i m a cryer i cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining i cried all the way through superman returns i did not however shed one tear during message in a bottle in english class i always learned to show not tell when writing when that is your rule of thumb you ll write a moving piece of literature even if you re not completely skillful sparks is the master of telling without showing im honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets the story is somewhat engaging but with no payoff but the work is filled with passages like and these are from memory if i picked up the book to look for verbatim examples i d have to type the entire thing he went to the refrigerator opened the door and took a beer after opening it he sat down on the back deck or though she was overweight she moved quickly around the table she got out of the shower dried off and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt have you read enough yet im new to the romance genre my mother inlaw recommended sparks because i think she was trying to imply his sex scenes aren t too graphic they were to me but then i m new to romance and spoiled by the masterful unequaled storytelling skill of stephen king please hold your new york times bestsellers to a higher standard let s hold on to whatever quality control we can in music movies and literature 
wrong wrong wrong someone should actually read this book before reviewing it like bill gates popcorn is as wrong as she is right visionary i ll tell you who the visionary is ted nelson not faith cocooning it never actually happened as popcorn describes it 
the book was as rocky as the characters in it i saw jessica hagedorn speak at the nd street y which is where i recieved her book once i began to read the book i became absorbed into her book jessica hagedorn does a good job at describing the essence of the bohemian punk rock culture my only problem was that the book became really confusing once in the middle the beginning of the book was straight forward and easy to read but once rocky becomes pregnant the whole book seems confusing the book became really boring once it got to a certain point and i became really dissapointed 
a little to much hype on here about this book it is a good book for reading but not as a refrence if you in the trade and want a book for the plane ride ok but will you learn anything new maybe if you read jlc journal of light construction and keep up with the trade you won t find anything new here if you a novice with basic knowledge and want an overview of building that is well written but poorly photographed and lacking when it comes to illustrations then buy the book for refrence and true learning for not just professionals but every day people i would recommend jlc field guides or graphic guide to framing either will suit you well no matter what your level of skill 
nothing particularly new here this is just another themed deck that adds nothing special to the rider waite family of imagery yes the pictures have an eastern flaire the insights pretty much stop there 
a real farse i read the other reviews and thought wow a good source of knowledge instead i got a book full of ridiculous so called tools to help in defining the data model meta data bingo if i sent mail out as suggested in the book to play this sort of game i think i would lose all credibility with my peers this book just does not add any value unless you are a complete idiot actually the only value add is to the author a real waste 
useful historical tool this book doesn t exactly have an original premise a west point graduate named philip dru fights for the rights of the oppressed by overthrowing the american government and implementing a benevolent dictatorship forgive the oxymoron so as to correct the problems of society such a book while shocking at first glance is so common that rarely would i consider it worth reading this one however comes with an interesting catch it was written by none other than edward house the name might not ring a bell for most people but colonel edward m house was woodrow wilson s closest advisor during the first six years of his presidency and as such this book yields amazing insights into the philosophical and personal character of a man who was one of the most powerful in the nation and for a brief period of time in the world for that alone it deserves to be read it suffers however from house s own shortcomings as a writer the prose is pedestrian the dialogue cliched and trite the narrative development utterly predictable and often unrealistic and the explanations and analysis given to major problems of the day simplistic and absurd indeed it is amazing that a man of wilson s great intellect and brilliant insights would have ever associated with much less trusted someone who could write something so poor the fact that wilson was one of our greatest presidents is a wonder given the content of this book aside from its historical significance it has no redeeming value 
fitting finesse for a novice sewer i found it to complicated to follow 
don t expect much this book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy save your cash and get it from the library then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman not a child taking orders or information without question if you want to go through pregnancy labor and birth and have no say at all or learn anything useful then stick with this book i e go to the hospital have an epidural episiotomy then finally the c section that must have been necessary this is it beyond that read ina may gaskins henci goer the sears books and childbirth without fear read a broader selection many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore i am a mother of have had healthier more positive birth experiences than anyone i know this book is misleading and negative make it the joyful event you deserve 
a dull psychoanalysis as an avid fan of desperate housewives i am really not all that impressed with this book while some of it was interesting to read the majority was dull and often annoying at times it seems as of the editor of this book was looking to make a quick buck off of america s hottest new series this book is a collection of essays that picks apart and analyzes certain aspects of the show all along diagnosing and dissecting the characters and the motives behind their actions it basically recaps what we saw in the episodes and then whoever wrote the essay throws in their opinion and psychoanalyzes the scene characterepisode where it gets annoying is when the editor author of the essay goes into their own life biography and tries to make themselves feel important enough to be compared with the characters on the show half of the essay is an overly detailed explanation of the author s daily life and then suddenly a quote from the show is thrown in summarized and analyzed truthfully i don t understand the purpose of this book it s as if a bunch of women got together and threw in their opinions along with their own personal stories and issues it s basically boring coffee talk with a bunch of strangers fans of the show will be disappointed this isn t worth buying unless you are trying to psychoanalyze the show and even then it s not quite worth it 
premise has potential but disappointing the premise of people with animal dna i thought had potential for interesting differences and conflicts having read and enjoyed other paranormal and romantica novels the reviews had me looking forward to this one the main characters were attractive enough and although the plot was fairly predictable the book s biggest disappointment was that the hot encounters between callan and merinus was so motivated by an overwhelming chemical dependency via callan s pheromones that the sex was disturbingly and distractingly involuntary like a drug addiction if this sounds like it would bother you look elsewhere 
just about unfinishable bore the bourne identity by this author was great but this is a contrived monumental bore intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention this book is some kind of desperately single minded looney left hate fest ok you can say hoover was a monster and say it again times maybe even or times but that does not a book make the world presented here is sick but the sickness is the author s monomania 
a sinister plot worthy of dr evil the book starts out well enough when banker ben hartman in switzerland on business runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him then through a series of accidental discoveries narrow escapes and unbelievable coincidences hartman learns that practically everybody he knows and everyone new he meets is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination when you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is it seems like something only austin powers nemesis dr evil could have pulled off without giving too much away i have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain s heavily guarded secret mountain lair and of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero yeah baby yeah 
duveen this book was horrible ! there was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about duveen it is so boring all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from duveen and his crazy ways this book was so bad please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book 
frustrated can t give any star but your system insist i have ordered the items twice and still have not received it by now because your shipping department have problem to provide the correct mailing address to dhl 
nambla members line up for blocks to get this now that hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation thank god for hannity ! lee krock founder of nambl 
the writing never really comes together this is a collection of short stories revolving around the new founder of her own detective agency the book spends a fair amount of time on local color the mysteries if you can call them that are light weight there s nothing wrong with any of that often i want a light read but there were two big factors that i could not get around that make me give a one star rating first the people in botswana are presented very negatively and the men are even worse than the women maybe most botswanans truly are self centered bastards but i found that too hard to believe even so i could accept that depiction in a hard boiled detective book but this is more of a sunny sideup book second the author keeps presenting contradictory pictures of the characters particularly the main character in one story she is shown as exceptionally honest while most other stories show her freely lying in one story she says she would never commit a crime and in another story she steals a car in one story she is attracted to a man who beats and rapes her in some stories she has no interest in any man and in one story she is attracted to an apparently nice man i kept asking myself if the author was trying to make some point by these contradictions but i couldn t discern any theme and came to believe it was simply poor writing 
far from the standard of the delaware series two huge problems with this book one this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and traveling and learning when they already know his identity so i guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass two the city of los angeles functions as a character in kellerman s other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels this thing drags on in some unnamed nondescript city 
warning recipes don t compute the book may be easy to read and a good overview of the zone diet plan but the first recipe i ve tried vegetarian lasagna turned out to be a disaster to begin with the ingredient list is faulty it calls for tablespoons of italian seasoning but in the procedure you only use teaspoons it then tells you to blend the cottage cheese until smooth what cottage cheese it was never on the ingredient list finally right when you now know something is definetly off with the recipe and your assembling the noodles etc it doesn t fit in the pan so much for for tonight s dinner and the two hours in the kitchen the recipe was a good idea and i m interested in a solution if you ever read this ms gittleman 
sick book we were forced to read this book in philosophy class some yearsback and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men andinability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse her viewof women isn t much better in that they are supposedly thepoor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such adistasteful act as intercourse the male in her book is theaggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willingvictim to only get children and love in return if she can t seethe pleasure of the sex act then it s no one s fault but hers every page of the book was hard to read i don t know why somepeople bother to read such books because it s a waste oftrees paper and time another problem is she makes it sound as though women wholike intercourse aren t up to her intellectual level as thoughshe has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse she tries to make very subjective material sound like it ssupposed to be the objective norm for every woman not very dangerous book 
too much hyp for an okay book i have heard that this is a children s book and perhaps there are abridged versions but i have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense verbose novel and understand the subtle underlying themes swift portrays i have heard many positive reviews concerning this book and although there are many insightful points perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion for very often i got lost in the words and nonending references to english politics on the other hand it s important to note that in the early th century english satire was probably extremely dry very different from today huh and hard to follow all in all this book is an exploration into man s true nature and despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge expresses a mature intellect that reflects swift s intelligence 
big bummer i cook healthy all the time and just got this book as a gift im so unimpressed i d seen ellie s show on the food network a couple of times then stopped watching because the stuff she makes is still fattening if you re trying to stay in shape sure it has healthy fats blah blah but that doesn t keep you in shape i d be a bit forgiving if the stuff actually tasted great but it s mediocre at best the book is no different and she s not even fun to watch like rachel or giada i have a pile of healthy cookbooks and diet books this one is definitely my least favorite 
rubbish first let me say i am a beleiver in the ufo phenomenon however the special on saw on tlc absolutely proved to me the phoenix lights were flares but i guess people will beleive almost anything if it make their theory correct 
could be so much better than it is although the book with its illustrations sidebars and accompanying cd seemed so promising in the end this is a disappointing compilation the book and cd waste a lot of space with some of the most commonplace forms of poetry mother goose rhymes and limericks to which many parents will have already introduced their children the book veers from nursery rhymes to multiple poems involving death to shakespearean sonnets the choices of poems within each form introduced could have been improved upon many are downright uninteresting finally i reached for the cd hoping the purchase could be saved by the careful luscious reading of selected excellent examples on it alas alack two professional actors read neither unfortunately possessing either the gravitas or the tonal depth to make the poems ring and again the cd is littered with limericks and nursery rhymes 
i agree i agree with the reviewer who wrote the parental warning i tried to submit a similar review when i first got this book in december of but amazon edited it out because i mentioned some of the chapter headings on various forms of sex covered in the book i guess in four years time mentioning oral and anal sex has become more acceptable i bought the book because i had found mavis jukes first book to be so helpful wry and well written while this book is indicated as a book for pre teens it is much more advanced in it s sexual content than i felt my then year old was ready to read about now that she is almost i am thinking about bringing it down from the topmost shelf of the cabinet where it has collected dust for the last years be warned that it is not really appropriate reading for a pre teen at least not in my hosehold and certainly not without heavy parental input and discussion 
the chicken soup for the writing itdown souls this book may be as well called the chicken soup for the writing itdown souls the author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories however if you are a self help reader like me who is used to david allen s getting things done you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can 
too painful ms headley really does seem to be just thrilled with herself that s fine but i was far too bored with her life to want to keep reading 
waste of time buy quothow to draw comics the marvel way quot instead as stan lee and john buscema cover all the necessary points in a few pages as opposed to wasting your money on a book like this although kudos to this guy for padding a book this size he must be close with scott mccloud 
please do not be mislead by the title if you re interested primarily in near death experiences then do not go with this one mrs whitfield describes her two nde s here but this is for the most part a new age compendium on how to increase your spirituality through the balancing of your chakras handling psychic and kundalini energies etc there s nothing wrong with that except for perhaps misleading the public with the title such as it is mrs whitfield is an accomplished therapist and extemely well studied in her work but there are too many publications available like this one for those wanting powerful testimonials from those who have had near death experiences you will not find it here there are so many more books available from amazon that carry nde accounts that will change your life 
high hopes not fulfilled i was really looking forward to reading this book after several warm recommendations but i was sadly disappointed the contents was reasonable giving but the language and the presentation i give it for contents for language and grammar for presentation and structure hmmm divided by is no that s more than it deserves 
alrighty then i ve read through rolling stone s greatest albums guide and it has some real problems all of which add up to it being extremely unhelpful for someone honestly looking for great albums i considered giving this guide a higher rating simply because i agree that many of the albums included really are great but the writing or really the lack thereof is so bad that this book couldn t possibly be helpful to anyone who was not already familiar with the albums this book gets off to a preposterous start when the editor claims that the beatles first album should be the number one album because it is the first one that he bought and getting all nostalgic about it makes him feel all warm and fuzzy inside wha and this guy is the editor that s not a basis for an argument for an album s position on a list ranking greatest albums ! that should have told me what i was getting myself into by continuing to read if you were to ask yourself whether or not you know anything new about the music after reading the article for any given album in this book most likely the answer will be no especially for you may know that the drummer spilled beer on his drum kit while recording the big hit single or some other piece of at best marginally useful information but that s about it and they don t even put much effort into providing much in the way of that level of information beyond the first albums the rest only get a paragraph of completely obvious and or useless information for a while i was under the impression that rolling stone was a music magazine that was knowledgeable about and understood and appreciated music well rock music at least in the most narrow definition of the term and perhaps blues the father of rock this book and other publications such as their brazenly mindless album guide truly show what little respect and appreciation that they have for music i almost get the impression that they want to show that they are too cool to take music seriously enough to put any thought or effort into what they write they rarely even attempt to make a convincing argument as to why the albums hold the positions that they do in this book it s clear after reading this guide and their magazine review section for a while that the critics at rolling stone do not thoroughly listen to albums and that they rate music based on things that have nothing to do with the merits of the material they rate music based on type and image more than anything else being much more concerned with shaping and pushing their idea of cool than with the actual merits of the music it s obvious that they don t even understand jazz which i guess goes hand in hand with not understanding even the fundamentals of music theory but there are many areas of music that they don t seem to understand or appreciate i don t see how it is at all helpful to judge music by how closely it adheres to aesthetic characteristics that are generally specific to the type that you like those that fit the mold will likely be overrated and those that don t will likely be underrated rolling stone takes this unbelievably self indulgent approach throughout this book so this guide ends up being really unhelpful but hey where else are you going to find a book with so many pretty and glossy artist and album cover photos unless that s what you re looking for though you re better off saving your money the only consistently helpful and reliable expert critical review source that i m aware of is wilson alroy s record reviews so you should go over there and check out their site and their star records page in particular if you want a truly helpful guide to some great albums 
should have never been written this book should never have been written as the ending to hyperion was perfect in my opinion this story feels rushed and simmons completely changed the writing style of hyperion to force this book out one piece of advice read this really fast so you won t notice all the plot loopholes the only reason that it is not a one star book is that the setting of hyperion is impressive 
disappointing disappointing disappointing i have enjoyed many of anne tyler s books particularly dinner at the homesick restaurant breathing lessons and back when we were grownups saint maybe was a huge disappointment the plot and characters were mediocre at best and a bizarre religion the church of the second chance played a major part in the story by the end of the book it had completely taken over the church of the second chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult yes ian bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life but why the book was named saint maybe is still a mystery to me one of the children in ian s care made reference to ian as perhaps being saint maybe but who the heck is saint maybe the closest i could come up with is maybe you will finish the book and maybe you won t 
at times enjoyable and a great read but overall a long bore that drags on i really liked the book from the begging i got hooked and could not stop reading i loved the part with the missinaries and there triels and tribulations we see how the missionaries tried tyo change hawaii s customs on the people and we sew the down fall of the missionaries but after that the book draged on and lost it s touch it went on and on and on and only a few other things i enjoyed i laos enjoyed the leaper partsd and the trials and tribulations of the chinese and japense people the problem here is that the auther gose on and on about pointless stuff we will soon forget this novle could easly of been pages but it s over i was dissapointed but it wasent entirley a bad book it was enjoyanle at times 
not my favorite from koontz i love koontz but this book fell far from the mark it started off slow and i found myself thinking where is this going and in the end i felt it took me nowhere and the t s elliott quotes got a little annoying if you re a fan like me i know you ll read it despite this review but if you re a first time koontz reader don t start with this book it is definitely not his best work try odd thomas or even going way back here the funhouse instead 
i m really sorry i tried to read and love this book several times and i have a degree from columbia in literature and i read a lot of fantasy but i just can t get into this book nothing happens ! it just goes on and on and i can t like or identify with or wish to live vicariously through anybody isnt that what the fantasy genre is supposed to be about 
why continue to be deceived tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the pre trib circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler etc continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen s the real rapture based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period series see prophecy house s web site prophecyhouse dot com for details on these items 
complete i was very disapointed that the cards were not the most current with the publication date of october and this coinciding with the release of onslaught i thought it would be included my disapointment increased fold when i found out that oddyssey judgment and torment were also missing from the book i don t understand how one can say complete ! and have the buyer expect anything less than the inclusion of the oddyssey series 
underwater close encounter of the boring kind this thriller focuses on norman johnson a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes as the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the us navy johnson learns that the crash site is located feet under the south pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft he was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration an assignment that johnson would just as soon forget once the team is taken to the navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances that the navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology labels and directions are even written in english leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is the suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile this novel is quite predictable just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby that the undersea environment will become threatening there will be many deaths there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on while there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment crichton is capable of so much more if you are a fan read it but be forewarned if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this 
disappointing and unconvincing i thoroughly enjoyed the author s earlier work on how the irish saved civilization but this book was a disappointing compendium of greek myths legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book taken in its subparts many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight where s the big picture the author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the greeks variety of human response lightening quick transmutations resourcefulness and inexhaustible creativity a subtitle like a greek treasury of personal vignettes might have been more descriptive and merited another star but it falls short as a hinge of history with impoverished and even maladaptive connections fdr as solon really to the modern world i am sorry to not recommend it 
newberry winner i am a retired teacher and work part time in a school library i read the newberry winners each year for the second year in a row i am disappointed in the choice ! last year s kirakira was a disappointment as is this year s crisscross i m not certain of the standards by which the books are chosen crisscross remains a mystery to me because i see no outstanding literary value in the writing or the story itself 
horrible book did heinlein really write this this book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships heinlein is so different here than in his good books tunnel in the sky starship troopers door into summer or orphans of the sky that i wondered who actually wrote this awful work it seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti woman the basic premise is what would happen with a man s brain in a female body maybe a good concept but it is terrible in application here i just hated this book i was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work please consider avoiding this work perhaps every writer deserves some grace but this work is almost beyond redemption maybe heinlein was ill while writing this or maybe his editor was on drugs 
a little dry i found the book informative while reading it but also a bit confusing and a little dry best used for a college course and not for recreational reading which is no doubt why we even had it in our house someone had to use it and it s equally boring companion for some college course i m certain of it 
so glad i m done this book goes on my list of the worst books i have ever read it took me tries and a five days to get through the introduction i had to read it for my ap us history class and sure it was very educational i have a test on it tomorrow so let s see how much i retained it just took forever ! i spend days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful smokey mountains those days it took me to read the intro are not included i read all day every day and it bored me to death i constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those days i liked the last chapter because it was the last 
this was a really pathetic excuse for a seller the first book that was sent to me was defective the pages in it were out of of order and the book was missing about pages the seller assured me he would send another book which was also defective in the exact same way the seller has not contacted me despite several efforts to contact him and resolve the issue i am never speaking to dealing with this seller again 
huge disappointment and overly simplistic i was really looking forward to this book as a fan of some of his earlier books especially five dysfunctions of a team which is one of the most elegant frameworks i ve seen on team dynamics lencionis solution to silos and politics a shared goal with supporting objectives and metrics it s a lot more complex than just that and i m surprised he didn t bring in some of his other work related to team dynamics and leadership which must also be significant levers to help combat this problem if you re looking to solve your problem with silos and politics within your own organization keep looking 
bad i was looking foward to this book and then i read it and was so shocked ! it could have been a really great book if only the characters had morals it was suspensful and like i said could have been a good book if the characters didn t jump at the first hormonal chance to cheapen what could have been a good romance i strongly advise that anyone with the smallest shred of morality stay away from this book i only wish someone could have warned me 
militar policeman in vietnam i found this book to be well written and all the individual stories very interesting and factual war is hell 
only for diehard charlotte bronte fans although the spark of creativity is there it still takes some time to appreciated this novel after reading janes eyre the main character crimsworth seems to be arrogance aristocratic and audacious this could be bronte s first take on a male perspective but is that what she considered the male psyche to be as she portrays on her other novels male characters all in all the novel has some worth but needs getting used to 
stay away i ve never read any of her other work so it s actually possible that the author of this book is as awesome as all the reviews posted here say however i have read this book and it s not awesome in fact it s achingly far from being so stupid characters snail like plot and a complete lack of insight into anything i think reading it may have killed brain cells i can t afford to loose if you re interested in groupie musician relationships i suggest getting yourself a copy of bye bye baby my tragic love affair with the bay city rollers 
maybe i m justing getting older i have read all of the artimis fowl books and loved them until nowi was disapointed with this one and not found artmis unusaly irritating but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good truth be told i was younger when i read the first three but still i can reread them and enjoy them as i did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris so if you want my advice then i suggst you don t buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
left me empty my kids started reading the left behind kids books and because i was concerned about the message and theology of the books i started reading them also then i decided to check out the adult books from the library i am a born again pentacostal believer in jesus christ and parts of the theology are not what i read in the bible ok i can stil enjoy a good book one with interesting characters realistic dialogue and a good plot the issue of plot is difficult for the left behind books i admit because we know who wins if we ve read the end of the new testament as to the rest it fell flat most of the dialogue didn t ring true after a few of the books i was interested in some of the characters but by the end of the books there were only a few of the original characters left and they were some of the least interesting to begin with how many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in revelation how many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in book there is nothing new and interesting in this book the last book is just boring it would have been nice at the end of the book to wrap up everything jesus comes back and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over right some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all it was an incredible let down i felt like i had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over nothing we stick with that one main guy and everyone else is left in the dust it should have had a really really happy ending but even that was boring if i had my time back i would stick to the kid versions if only to discuss theological issues with my children at least in the kid books the sermons are shorter and i will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
rubish bla bla bla read inside job by jim marrs and watch the dvd in plane sight maybe you ll learn the truth 
gender of history this book fails to present any new argument for the treatment of women historically it does point out that women have been ignored over the centuries but most of us already knew that the use of technical language assumed foreknowledge of historical figures and an overestimated understanding of historical process make this book inappropriate for most undrgraduates graduate students should be able to muddle their way through most of the book and it is also a book for academic collections 
prose to make you cringe my favorite from this one had to be the fat guy s comment id be a rich man if i had a dime for every hour i ve spent auditing pentagon departments what he doesn t make more than per hour give me a break yes these are great page turners but the dialog is absolutely horrendous shakespeare he is not 
for die hard conrad fans only and i thought i was a die hard conrad fan ! he s one of those writers by whom i must read a book every two or three years but this one i did not like at all despite the usual brilliant prose much of it as good as anything conrad has done quottetherquot is a let down astoundingly depressing ! most conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure it all quottetherquot holds out no such hope it concerns a captain who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind doing so in order to provide for his family nothing turns out okay and no one ends up happy i don t ask for a lot of hope from the books i read but at least a little 
disappointed ok i went into this book hoping it would be a james michener type epic with sweeping characters and a grand sense of the rich field of middle eastern history since world war ii what i got was a romance novel about men s boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice the book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy in addition i was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the israeli point of view undoubtedly since i was hoping for the more inclusive michener type approach i stopped reading about halfway through my grade f 
superficial irrelevant and irritating let s see i graduate from law school at age twenty work as an attorney a real estate developer venture capitalist and a banker over a span of about thirty years then i get sick and am out of work when i am ready to return to work i through a large network of past contacts just happen to get a job teaching college courses which leads to writing books and appearing on national tv shows and which in turn leads to forming consulting businesses including life coaching and of course my advanced degreed wife takes a well paying job at a magazine as a cushion then i hold myself up as an example of how the typical person can launch a second career and put it all in a book second acts so the reader learns early on that the author cannot distinguish the irrelevant from the situation of most attempting to make a career change furthermore it is an irony which the author little sees that he did not depend on the exercises that he recommends to others in finding a second career he actually stumbled into most of what he calls a second career is that the real message get lucky of course what would a self help book be if it didn t have any number of exercises that must be followed to find a second career first of all one is to write about their dream passions strengths and weaknesses interests needs and the specific dream and then there are the typical obstacles of which one must be cognizant age money duration consent location physical condition education and training timing esteem fear of failure fear of success and fatalism there is a subtle message here that failure to launch a second career may be due to your failure to overcome these obstacles like they are not really obstacles after all this is the wrong genre to look for a realistic description and assessment of the world of work and training and education for it if employees were actually empowered and if students could get educated and trained without tremendous amounts of extraneous hoop jumping perhaps all of these books about how to deal with work and workplace unhappiness would not be necessary issues such as obsolescence and downsizing could be dealt with realistically taking into account the interests of all parties changing the content of one s current job would be possible chances are those who are doing what they absolutely love painters writers wood carvers etc aren t reading this book for those who have struggled in the world of work the typical self help platitudes are here their help is doubtful the author can hardly change workplace realities when careers or jobs are changed there is a very real possibility of experiencing the same limitations as before just in another guise adding to the irrelevancy of the book the author insists on adding numerous mini biographies of celebrities which have absolutely nothing to do with finding a second career as most would understand the concept furthermore those writing a serious book on general employment need to keep their personal lives out of it if one wanted to read memoirs one can find plenty 
written by a manger for managers i was able to go cover to cover in about minutes if you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit i found it to be off topic for me as i was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who think for a living rather than their managers 
what you would expect the jacket cover which talks about walsh being independent and unbiased belies the fact that walsh s report was issued two days before the election between bush and clinton there can be no doubt of the animus walsh had for bush if the things in this book are true after spending million dollars and years walsh could have gotten more convictions than oliver north for spitting on the ground this book is terribl 
left me feeling wanting somehow if i had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing i wouldn t have bought it he talks extensively about competition rigs rules etc which i had no interest in i have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns ever see a bad review in any of the gun magazines 
promise lost the title is misleading it should indicate that a great deal of other information is brought into play such as history politics and propoganda many will no doubt make the case for how these add information to the main story line i don t see how a flawed and simplistic history of early research in radiation helps tell the story of how a boy becomes interested in building a reactor if you want to read a better and more correct history of the discovery and early work in radiation even an encyclopedia does a better job and the author s drive to paint nuclear energy as black as possible leads him to huge errors in his facts what wernher von braun has to do with radiation i can t begin to guess but he was never a major in the ss he was never an officer in any nazi organization some reviewers dispute the author s aim to attack nuclear energy it s very telling that one of his oft quoted sources nukespeak was published by the sierra club and written by a trio who have made it public that their aim is to be sure this country turns permanently away from this energy source the author s significant mistakes are enough to discredit this book on their own merit or lack of i feel a need to also address his characterization of david and other geeks especially in lack of a mentor or proper guidance with potentially lethal equipment an enthusiastic student shouldn t be run down by adults that as much as any other event in david s life helped push him further into the hole he was digging withdrawing from possible assistance and causing david to adopt a suspicious and sarcastic attitude toward adults that s a certain recipe for the disaster that nearly was in david s life i do know of that which i speak my own experiments when i was younger nearly disposed of me and the abuse i took from peers and adults only made me more determined to show them i knew what i was doing i secreted all i did as david began to do we dorks may be dorks but alienating eccentrics doesn t help them or those affected by them a disappointing book one that could have risen to great heights the bigger shame is that there is no other book on the subject that i can recommend 
they shaved an ape and called him sean sean hannity s rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country especially when their audience consists of like minded organ banks hannity is stupid hypocritical and loud his sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon oxygen exchange hannity is well coiffed well dressed and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the hannity and combs report this bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt sizes too small get a real job you poser 
left behind certainly a nice looking book from what i understand marvels launched the careers of its two principle creators and it s definitely not a bad place to start alex ross s work is nothing short of spectacular his art is the closest comics will ever come to fine art and demands respect however i cannot give this book a glowing review because it failed on a very base level it failed to pull me into the marvel universe sounds odd i know but as a man in my early twenties with little to no understanding or appreciation of the marvel universe i m left in the dark i could easily understand why an older man or a marvel comic enthusiast would love this comic but as a newcomer i was left behind there is a very fine difference between inventing a concept and perfecting it marvels serves as the prototype for future masterpiece kingdom come which also featured an everyman pov naturally there s a frustration on my part that comic creators often make allusions or other nostalgic call backs to the silver age of comics this is problematic for comic readers who like myself have no intimate knowledge of that bygone era and from what i ve read of it there s not a lot that impresses me do not buy this book unless you are very much aware of marvel s content history otherwise you ll be left scratching your head god only knows what was happening during that galactus bout 
silly i found this book was written like a comedy but because it only made me laugh once it was just silly comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it and love it or you don t i didn t i found the dialect frustrating it was supposed to be set in kent but the dialect read more like northern england you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you re not even aware that humour is present at least that s what it was like for me whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn t explained in the end but you re left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn t really suit the book being or trying to be a comedy hence the lack of explanation i ve given it two stars because when gibbons takes a step back and looks at the overall picture she has a great way of describing scenes 
the idea is good but the idea is good the characters are really good with a few exceptions but this book s plot is extremely repetetive oh my gosh she s committed the unpardonable they have not choice but to curse her with death over and over again ayla breaking the most sacred est rule ever and then mysteriously not getting in serious trouble for it consumes the entire plot well not the entire plot the other involves how brun likes his son now he doesn t now he does ad nauseum in addition to the repetitious plot there is so much redundant text that one must wonder if anyone read the manuscript before it went to print the author will write for instance about how the clan was confused by ayla s tears since they don t cry and then pages later she writes the same thing i don t know how many times she wrote about ayla s tears brun s worry about broud how intercourse is strictly a natural function how they think she s ugly etc etc etc etc the be sure and purchase the next installment ending in infuriating i wouldn t recommend this book to anyone i see now why there are copies of it in every used book store that said i read the whole thing in days so that must say something good about it 
a waste of money a waste of money and time information so general that only a abolute beginner can use it so called expert tips are common knowledge tips for a succesful email be responsive to customers tip be honest all times tiptest tip have a good mailinglist tip have a good offer or quality product well well that s great news this book is a recyling of the recycling of the recycling you can easly see the book has been made in a few day 
a little dry good book if you re a booze fighter interested in the history of the club really the stories aren t that wild 
poorly organized the problem that i have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine that would be fine except that i go to the word it said to look up and discover that i either have to look up another word this book is not helpful in that respect and given that a lot of pcs run windows it doesn t really make sense to release a hypertext version for the mac but not one for windows so the windows users are stuck with a book that really isn t that good 
do not recommend this book is full of typos what happened to proofreading is that a lost art jobthis book is also a good example of what andy rooney spoke of authors making thousands on the backs of others nothing is original by the author in this book it is merely a compliation of the works of others you would think at least since the author did have to compose anything she could have at least proofread it 
not what i expected i was disappointed with this novel and expected something completely different i found it to be a little too out there and had to force myself to finish the book 
funny but under this guise should provide actual guidance a good helping of humor is good for potential grooms but most of us need more substantial info along with it this book does provide a few good laughs like the description of a diamond as an quotoverdigested lump of coal the kidney stone of earth s urinary tract quot but if you are looking for actual guidance which you most likely will need look elsewhere in the handful of books for grooms 
listen to your heart send in your query or your three chapters to fifty of these guys and then wait first they don t want to read them they hire someone to do this task they don t want to do it either they send you their rejection card and don t even acknowledge the title of your book once they did now they re too many of you they do get shills to write good things about their own published book because they want the expectant writer to buy it that s how they make money you must have a contact with a publisher or an agent or they won t touch your stuff even hemingway was going nowhere until scott fitzgarald reccommended him enough though of opinion ask anyone that you know who is an aspiring writer if they ever got a positive response from an agent michael blake dances with wolves never got an agent until costner said he was going to make the movie even then it was like pulling rotting teeth the publishers sent regection after rejection until blake sold it for to be published in paperback with a bonus if the picture was actually released he had given up writing after years when dances sold but who did he have to know kevin costner of all people another agent not blake s said he had only taken one client on in one year and only because the guy sent him a bottle of french wine he liked french wine go to the agent how badly do you want to be published talk to the agent find out if they are even in the neighborhood of what it is that you re writing call publishers talk to their assistants they ll talk to you if you keep it short find out what they really want go to the library or the internet but don t encourage these write and be published authors they are conning you none of these agents have the slightest intention of reading your chapters anyway one way or the other you will find out don t use someone else unless you have an in be your own agent good luck you writers some of you are great and are anguished over nothing you will succeed do it yourself and don t forget foreign publishers that publish in english they will read your stuff for heaven s sake s don t just sit there ! good hunting ! 
so disappointing i am glad i read this book before i saw johnny damon in a yankee uniform because the book is boring and could have been written by a tenth grader damon is in love with himself talks trash about his ex wife and the whole book sounds like a bad tv interview i can happily look at johnny damon in yankee gear and know it s no loss to the red sox 
deeply flawed the shortcomings of doniger s general indological scholarship have been detailed by michael witzel and rajiv malhotra this book suffers from the same flaws the translations are idiosyncratic and she is obsessed with finding sex even in situations that none is called for 
even if i didn t know this book was a farce it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read i read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about the writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read i ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over i know this is supposed to be for emphasis but i just found it indulgent the lack of correct punctuation was distracting too had i read this when the book first came out before everyone knew he lied i would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of aa although i have not attended aa or any similar support groups i feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own which in most cases i am sure they are not i found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than james frey and i can t say that i felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself but i am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn t feeling so badly anymore 
boots the original he was kind of cool but now he ain t people using his backwardness against us forget this dude or perish speech was a total sell out to da man drop ya boots dawg i 
the pursuit of arrogance simply put this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself it s like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical drunken uncle blah blah blah and then i saved the world and looked good doing it blah blah blah aren t i great 
relationships this book is for women who enjoy reading about relationships in repetitive excruciating detail her mother father sisters girlfriends boyfriends etc etc and her drinking guys will find this hard to keep open 
would you blame a cancer patient for her cancer then let s not pretend that diet has anything to do with the severe pain associated with endometriosis i followed the recommendations in this book for a month trial note i m already very physically active so i only followed the dietary recommendations result no effect whatsoever on my longstanding severe endometriosis the more i read the more i m convinced that dr redwine in oregon has the real answer meticulous surgery as the only real cure for endo hormonal treatments are only temporary and many women cannot bear the adverse effects associated with them including depression mood swings decreased intelligence etc pain medication works but who wants to be drugged for the rest of one s life medicinal cannabis helps the most of any nonsurgical treatment i ve had each of my surgeries has reduced the pain i hope that that my next surgery which will focus on the bowel bladder and diaphragm implants will be my last oh i ve gotten away from the point of this review anyway i checked this book out of the library to see if it said anything worthwhile but it didn t it s easy to prescribe good nutrition for a chronic condition who among us couldn t stand to eat a little better but this sort of approach is really a form of blaming the victim if you women would only eat properly you wouldn t have this terrible condition nonsense ! endometriosis is just like cancer except it doesn t invade the bone or lymph system that we know of and doesn t lead as quickly to death although some women suffering the intense pain of endometriosis sometimes briefly think that death would be preferable worst of all endometriosis can really ruin a relationship between a husband and wife because sex usually makes the symptoms far worse especially if the wife s physicians aren t sufficiently educated and think the problem is all in her head 
not recommended there are better novels of marie antoinette i often wonder how many more novels have yet to be written about marie antoinette how many times can the same old untruths be rehashed and retold the doomed princess trapped in an unhappy marriage surrounded by a hostile court who dies on the guillotine and on and on versailles is a vulgarized hazy rehashing totally lacking the delicacy and authenticity of chantal thomas farewell my queen or the powerful innovative punch of elena maria vidal s trianon at least it is not a complete fabrication like erickson s hidden dairy not my cup of tea but i do know others who have enjoyed it and kathryn davis seems to have a loyal following 
almost unreadable the text is thoroughly unorganized it has almost no coherent linear progression the author often repeats himself uttering the final solution of the jewish question over and over without giving an studied analysis of what that means the book is a pistache of accusations and anecdotes about people s involvement in the final solution without offering any studied analysis of any one particular group or person for example we are introduced to a commander wohlauf an office of battalion and his wife we are told that he killed jews and his pregnant wife watched but thats about it the author also infuses his writing with pedantry rather that presenting the facts as they are he is compelled to make the reader feel shocked by using exclamation points to drive home how we should feel undoubtedly antisemitism was endemic not only in germany but throughout europe but one gets the feeling that the author is cherry picking throughout history to bolster his outlandish thesis that the germans were predicated to mass murder of jews 
lazy man s way to riches there is supposed to be a companion web site that is not available and no contact with the author seems to be available very frustrating there is a companion guide that is out of print and is offered used on different web sites for over it s ridiculous 
they teach all this in college i didn t see anything in this book that was not covered in my college courses i felt like the author assumed i knew nothing and it felt like she was speaking down to me i wish i had never bought this book because now i have to deal with the hassle of returning it 
forget it this wasn t any good as a hardback and reissuing itin paperback doesn t change matters to get an idea of what you are in for see the reviewsof the hardback version bottom line don t waste your money 
to much detail moore told a good story but when the action would get going and you start getting ready for something big stop it all with a flashback at times one would have to reread something just to get your bearings again just too much detail at the wrong time in the story loved the bar fight in the middle but the sewer fight and few pages following with the horse and the gardener just about ruined the book i do look forward to reading his next book on conan just cut to the chase eri 
don t waste your time or money on this unless you ve never read any of his other books don t get me wrong i can t say enough good things about robert kiyosaki s books if you haven t read them rich dad poor dad cashflow quadrant etc i highly recomemd that you do but there s nothing new in this book it just a retread of ideas already presented in his other books and not as well if fact reading it felt like a advertisment for his other books and products 
a bit like a s serial frabato bardon battles the evil lodge on the eve of wwii this book is written in a flash gordon vs the cosmic meanies style further fractured through the services of a bad translator if this is bardon in action then imagine a scratchy sound track really evil bad guys in black suits and top hats and the ultimate good guys being koot hoomie and his ascended masters gliding to the rescue on flying carpets bardon s secretary wrote this one and i really believe she was planning to farm this script out to fritz lang at most quaint at worst a disappointment to anyone seeking enlightenment on the hermetic front 
boring this book is a great disappointment i forced myself to continue on thru the first pages and now i am getting rid of it what of waste of my precious reading time 
some people some other place i belong to a book club comprised of mostly school teachers and other professional older women members read this book and not ! liked it 
why is newt perpetuating the jesus freak cause our founding fathers were not christians this propaganda is by a guy who tried to impeach clinton while he himself had an affair on top of that gingrich tried to pass a bill that would give the death penalty to pot smokers people who brought grams of weed with them over the border talk about crazy this guy shouldn t be in politics he should be in a siberian labor camp he like all christian fundamentalists should just take his bible and his lord baby jesus and shove it deep up his a because the rest of the country really doesn t want to hear the bells of theocracy anymore do we really want to put our nation in the hands of this antiquated nihilistic jesus myth i think not again this isn t the united states of lord baby jesus and we as a nation should do everything in our power to prevent it from becoming so its also important to realize that our founding fathers were not christian they were deists which is akin to today s agnosticism george washington s practice of christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a christian he repeatedly declined the church s sacraments never did he take communion and when his wife martha did he waited for her outside the sanctuary even on his deathbed washington asked for no ritual uttered no prayer to christ and expressed no wish to be attended by his representative here are some of the many anti religious quotes by our founding fathers john adams this would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it the divinity of jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity nowhere in the gospels do we find a precept for creeds confessions oaths doctrines and whole cartloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in christianity thomas jefferson i do not find in orthodox christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law benjamin franklin lighthouses are more helpful than churches the way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason i looked around for god s judgments but saw no signs of them in the affairs of the world men are saved not by faith but by the lack of it thomas paine i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief and for my own part i disbelieve them all all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit the study of theology as it stands in the christian churches is the study of nothing it is founded on nothing it rests on no principles it proceeds by no authority it has no data it can demonstrate nothing and it admits of no conclusion save yourself the money and do the research yourself the proper role of a government is to remain agnostic and remember our founding fathers did not believe in jesus 
mcdonald s how to build a mcempire while making people mcfat funny how people always vote a review to be not helpful when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn t like if you are a mickey d s binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage or if you are a mc exec you ll automatically hate my review or any others like mine but if you re here to really see what someone who hasn t been mc brainwashed hopefully this review will help you this book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit focused means by which mcdonald s has grown into the fast food empire it is today sure it s a capitalistic wet dream but what this book doesn t cover is how mickey ds exloits workers vales corporate profits over franchise success and feeds people mcgarbage that can t even be called food all without being honest about its products or practices im sure devoted mceaters and mccapitalists will trounce my star rating review but that really just proves my point read this book but if you care to know the whole story be sure to also read something presenting another view such as fast food nation 
sometimes witty often wrong mark steyn in broadway babies say goodnight musicals then and now has accomplished an unique objective he has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative love musicals particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author s glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance even stranger is that he has found these people and god bless them they have the book they have always dreamed about for anyone else this can be a bit of a slog it is funny espcially if you like puns in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless this book is not truly bad it is just simply odd if you like mark steyn this book is more about him anyway then enjoy othewise it is worth a pass 
wolf in sheep skin if you are a christian this book isn t for you it is full of blashphemy concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution since when was god in need of forgiveness isnt it that god so loved the world and it wasnt us that loved god i have no words in describing this book it is full of error because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner and that it isnt your fault and that actully you are a good person why do bad things happen to good people wrong question there are no good people in the world in the first place for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god the world is in sin the world does not have good people only by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book it hasnt helped million people but it lied to them kusher please turn from your ways and come to jesus then will you understand the life question why 
elegant but still empty among the most provocative comments on heaven is a cartoon that appeared in the new yorker years ago it showed the pearly gates with a small sign in front welcome to heaven population heaven is what everyone hopes for the leading underpinning for faith yet it has never been shown to exist russell s elegant and intelligent book makes a powerful case for the notion that attacks on the concept of heaven and by extension religion are flawed with an appreciation for subtle argument and vast historical tradition he canvasses some of the most important sources of the heaven myth for such it remains this is a rather one sided book whether marx freud dawkins or derrida makes flawed arguments russell has still failed to answer the objections of those who see a preview of hell in the collapse of the world trade center there is little appreciation that heaven is not just a divine reward but has also been used to justify oppression cruelty and indifference with a shrug of pious shoulders and the equivalent of the oft repeated therell be pie in the sky by and by heaven was the lure that drew terrorists to die in an act of foul murder to them it was a faith based act that guaranteed admission to heaven who can help but be ambivalent about anything that is claimed to inspire such profoundly different and morally inconsistent consequences arid discussions of aquinas simply fail to deal with these issues russell also does not meet the legitimate claims of those who know how easily promises of eternal bliss can be used to crush hopes for justice fairness and compassion here on earth let alone the notion that we still actually need the earth people who can defend global pollution and fear mongers of all descriptions rail that we need to prepare for the rapture and let our unique and wonderful planet die we have heaven to look forward to after all somehow the idea of heaven has been permitted to eclipse the wonders of this earth however it came to be and to obscure the need for morality as opposed to mere dogmatism in this life i think many of the early religious fathers would cringe at the way heaven has been and is being used to inspire violent fanaticism or indifference to humankind and earth arguably god s creation this is taking heaven in vain russells book tells us nothing about any real afterlife there is after all nothing to tell it is rather a useful way of understanding the sometimes beneficent often ugly values of those who cannot be happy with life on earth and want their reward or revenge in the alleged hereafter like individual notions of god notions of heaven readily become mere extensions of one s own predilections far more worthwhile is still the classic and profound work of william james the varieties of religious experience who was reputed to be too religious for the skeptics but not religious enough for the doubters for those whose minds are open to the real physical heavens carl sagan s outstanding new book published posthumously by his widow and colleague ann druyan is truly awe inspiring she adapted the title for this collection of sagan s gifford lectures from james himself the varieties of scientific experience we can read sagan s words with new delight as he offers among the most thoughtful insights i have ever read on the universe and our place in it the lectures are rendered in sagan s characteristically lucid delicious prose with gorgeous photographs often in color of phenomena in the actual heavens this is a handsomely produced book in it sagan gives as much proof as anyone can of how wonderful our planet is and how fortunate we are to be able to enjoy it if there is a heaven sagan must be there along with darwin galileo and t h huxley but enough of that heaven let s enjoy and preserve the one we have now while we can 
not nice i fell in the pond once and it really wasn t very nice and this book brought back horrible memories for me especially with its overly descriptive passages on pondweed and quacking ducks i was too traumatised to carry on reading not a book for sensitive people 
asinine with vapid characters if this were a satirical view of regency books i might have bought the far fetched storyline the flat idiotic characters and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot as i rather suspect it is not a satire catherine coulter being a best selling romance novelist it was disappointing to say the very least i only i repeat only listened to it in its entirety because i hadn t brought anything else to listen to at work one day if you like historical romance that s fun and funny try katie macalister s book improper english or for some more serious historical fiction check out phillippa gregory s wideacre series 
alarmingly bad shtick this is a very bad book once you get past your self conscious fear that you are missing something i would say an alarmingly bad book one has to wonder why this manuscript was submitted and if submitted not edited this turns into a repetition of the allusive and graceful for sure but unsubstantiated shtick of the by now facile co mingling of forms and genres made even weaker by a lack of discipline to corral digressive discursions and courage to present arguments in at least occassionally straightforward logical presentation this is all riffing on material we ve seen before and it repeats and repeats and repeats itself yes we can treat yahweh as a purely literary textual rather than an embedded national cultic figure whose text was never naked and whose narrative was never uninstantiated in an actual religious national culture itself progentive but not as a culture textual canonical and compare this to the figure of jesus christ as god and then propose a gnostic trope of yahweh s self shrinkage in internally distancing and neurotic zimzum presumably we could also describe quantum mechanics in a poetical fashion and discourse freely on the feline qualities of schrodinger bifurcated cattiness vis a vis the solid roundness of newtonian physical matter except we would be missing what was substantive and unique about the actual subject matter i will let christians decide whether the oft repeated and repeated remark that jesus christ is not yahweh is meaningful or provocative for them as a semi agnostic jew i would agree that christianity has not supplanted judaism and that judaism will and must always attempt to define itself on its own terms still i must wonder what this observation when it comes for the second fifth and tenth time actually tells us about the plurality of second commonwealth judaisms the full gestalt of yahwehism throughout patriarchal rabbinic and mystical literature or indeed the jewishness of classic christian doctrinal claims in an age where very orthodox jews who do it is true practice the law now freely confess to belief in a dead messiah who will be resurrected and who many declare is the essence of god in a body moreover the second andthird hand derived picture of kabbalah most particularly the poetical post kafkaesque elaboration on the meaning and emotional import of yahwehs zimzum is a debilitatedly reductionist and misleading summation for the reader of the contextual placement and import of zimzum and shvirat keliim within the rich panoply of inter related lurianic symbology as understood through its oral and written expositors just as hamlet really is not yeshua and bloom s yahweh is an over familiarized and sized down version of the theophononic and hieraphantic yahweh adonoiel of jewish tradition and practice so is his yahweh of zimzum an over angst compressed shoebox size misimpression of the divine structure of actual lurianic kabbalah 
fabrications helllo ! i am mambo racine sans bout the same mambo racine about whom ross heaven has so many nice things to say in his book vodou shaman it is with some regret that i must warn the prospective reader that most of what is in this book never actually happened ross is willing to say anything for a buck apparently he never let me see what he was writing until the book was published and i never imagined he would make up so many stories ! now that i have refused to support his activities he is very angry with me but the fact remains that this book is bunk 
trotsky mass murderer and liar you know i hate to burst the bubble of devoted trotskyites across the globe but trotsky was just as responsible for stalin s rule as anyone for leon to blame stalin is the height of hypocrisy without lenin s apparatus of social repression and trotsky s apparatus of military dictatorship stalin would never have been the russian revolution was never a win for workers it destroyed them some million at lenin s hands million by stalin and million by mao tse tungno policy or ideology that denies the soul can ever succeed and communism does just that by denying that which makes humans humans it can bring only suffering 
bad compilation although compiled by someone who is supposedly an english expert the manner in which verses are compiled in the book is much like ready on very long run on sentence more thought should have been given to a format that is more readable 
no on the whole i wasn t satisfied with the book in all fairness i did take de as a summer class maybe that s why i don t have fond memories of this book i m not an engineering major i m not physics major i found the books almost constant reliance on engineering and physics to introduce concepts to be very disappointing i think the book lacks balance also i found some of the examples lacking i found better explanations of identical topics in my calculus book larson and in my linear algebra book kolman an engineer that i know tried to use the book to review some stuff and found it fairly useless dover makes some good cheap de book 
one percent of trillion is page for example out of a worldwide total of trillion in international bank loans and deposits in only about billion went to poor countries less than one percent out of trillion in international investment securities only about billion went to poor countries an even smaller fraction of one percent i really enjoyed this book until i read this passage now i m doubting everything i ve ever learned about math 
this is not the original story this is a shorter much simplified version of the original story that was published by pantheon books in i m not sure what the point was in making a simplified version since the complete story of cornelius was my son s favorite when he was years old i d skip this version and go with the original 
not far enough the wisdom of menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman s body during and after ovarian failure menopause this book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause ovarian failure while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace i don t believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer 
please stop if you had a son or daughter take their own life would you try to profit from it this is a sad sad story of a sad young man who took his own life to become closer to his delusional mother wake up anne you talked all this physic nonsense and new age mumbo jumbo to your vulnerable and hurting son and you have the audacity to write a book in his name after he is gone this is not his story it is your sick twisted story told in your words not his you are evil 
quotwartime america quot this book took me three months to read it was so dry and boring it put me to sleep the book contains no charts no photos nothing but text it was part of an assignment for a college lesson i m embrassed to admit i chose this book because it was thin yet the subject was over the topic i wanted after i read it i didn t find the deepth it promised its view was off in left field if i was going to point out any one thing i learned for this book i d say size doesn t always make a book easy quot 
disappointing but readable two andahalf stars in requiem faulkner pens a sequel to his sensational novel sanctuary attempting to navigate the troubled marriage of gowan and temple stevens he delves deep into temple s psyche revealing a woman unable or unwilling to escape her troubled violent past in memphis just as her marriage is spiralling to destruction gowan and temple s daughter dies at the hands of their nurse nancy faulkner seems to be trying to lend some serious philosophical weight to the otherwise lightweight sanctuary two problems first sanctuary was fine as it was a sequel was unnecessary second the narrative structure of requiem half prose half play while initially intriguing ultimately hinders faulkner is his attempt to probe psychological depths theres only so much of that you can do when you re limited to dialogue oh and of course that annoying ubiquitous allknowing lawyer gavin stevens has to put his in i recommend this book only for true faulkner lovers 
how can a writer this bad sell so many books someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was halfway through i find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style it s a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing it s good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors i m not missing much 
hugely disappointing but essential for d d i was hugely disappointed with this book while some of the new rules features are nice those familiar with its nd edition predecessor the monstrous manual will find the more aesthetic aspects of this book lacking firstly the quality of the illustrations in this book doesn t even come close to that of the e monstrous manual the same could be said for most of wotc s illustrations some creatures don t even get an illustration secondly the book is poorly laid out this has already been discussed and wotc rectified it in subsequent mm publications but they should seriously consider re revising this book thirdly the editing is almost nonexistent barely a page goes by without some sort of typographical error ie cleric spelled clertic or x monster is about is about y feet high hell the sub editors didn t even notice that their entry in the credits is written as editorial assitance there is a proofreader named in the credits but it s painfully obvious she didn t actually do any proofreading before the book went to print in conclusion while the e monstrous manual might be obselete in terms of rules it was a much better product it had more monsters better illustrations a better layout and better editing it was better value for money than this rubbish sadly though if you want to run a game using the d d rules you re going to need to get a copy of this book see if you can get one second hand though as it s really not worth the price new 
good info but trite and patronising the book is filled with good definitions about the winding road that is ivf fertility treatment is packed with acronyms abbreviations and science and the author does do a good job of explaining what all of the acronyms and abbreviations are the book flows well and has wit but the constant underlying message is one of success ! ivf succeeds ! just keep your legs in the air take to bed rest keep thinking smiley happy positive thoughts and it always works ! as someone who s been through a few rounds of ivf and ongoing still it s not that easy for most people ivf is hard enough without infusing constant messages of false hope i feel the author is irresponsible in suggesting that ivf can be otherwise 
into the deep drowned in the cases this student textbook assumes a basic of management accounting well i was known with the terms and understood their examples but completely lost track at the cases at first i thought it was due to my language knowledge but colleague students had the same problems and couldnot explain to me which information to use which parts of the cases was useful and what was rubbish of course management accounting is about retrieving the correct information but it was a few steps to early for me 
find better information online i m not even going to go into how basic and well bad this book is i recommend you go search some free websites on how to buy a business you will learn everything that s in this book and more 
who fact checked this thing this book is terrible riddled with mistranslations gross generalizations and mystifying pseudofacts a lovely idea with poor execution 
beauty is skin deep such beautiful pictures and they are great inspiration makes you want to spend the day in the kitchen there it ends i tried the white chocolate candy cane recipe twice it just doesn t work we i have a professional kitchen added flour to make a manageable batter but after baking could not get them off the baking sheet more adjustments and finally succeeded in making a cookie that no one liked we also tried the two layer desert with brownie bottom expensive mess the beautiful photographs are worthy of framing or put the whole book on your coffee table 
the relativity of choice mrs windle s book was very entertaining although not very original mostly it consists of a laundry list of the alleged activities by the antis whom she blames for all her troubles although others may say that her career choice was the cause of her grief she specifically blames operation rescue s impact school graduates for her decline in health and finances but brushes aside the stigma of an quotimage of providers as less than noble quot her own words and the visual carnage that must be the daily reproductive health scene as contributing factors although the subtitle of this book is antiabortion terrorism she details many antiabortion activites which are harmless and legal could these actions have significantly lowered the daily quottakequot and thus be the real reason why mrs windle cried uncle 
disappointed i have read many of james patterson s books and have never been disappointed this book however was a big let down i almost didn t finish reading the first few chapters because i had difficulty following it they were choppy and confusing after the shaky beginning it was much better and i found myself enjoying the storyline until the end the end was stupid for lack of a better word twist yes it was a twist but in a direction that made no sense why i thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending but he didn t 
not recommended the premise the title and even the cover art are all misleading this book does not really explore the world of internet dating beyond or dates the main character jess is single and envious of her sister olivia and olivia s perfect marriage and children as a birthday gift jess receives a subscription to an online dating site and manages to go on about dates during the course of a year not stunning odds and not very interesting reading either maybe it s just me but i really thought this book was going to focus more on the dates and less on jess and her sister in the midst of the book the story takes a drastic turn and becomes very deep in terms of the storyline the storyline which involves olivia just didn t gel with the rest of the book and its upbeat attitude it was as if a large cloud came over the book midway through and it was hard to get the spirit of the book back jess does change throughout the course of the year but with only dates as a frame of reference her changes are not that believable and neither is her eventual romance i just thought this book was poorly written which aside from its poor storyline is illustrated by all the swearing waste of your time 
a long running series has run too far downhill it s not unreasonable for authors to give the characters in their mysteries background lives and to have those lives evolve in volume after volume however there is such a thing as changing a character so much that she or he is no longer recognizable that s happened in this volume along with a lot of sloppy stilted writing that seems almost as though someone took words of brown s and tried to arrange them into one of her mysteries and didn t quite succeed lets start with the biggies harry quit the post office while a reason is given for this let s face it without the day today post office stuff and the people who help at the po and the people who come in and the downtown businesses an awful lot of the atmosphere of the village is removed and an awful lot of the interesting things that harry filled her days with as well among other things that have changed all out of recognition harry s become friends with boom boom the woman who s the reason that fair is her ex husband and not only harry but all her friends as well seem to have suddenly become virgin marygroupies a statue we ve never seen before is suddenly treated as if oh yeah all the women in this town go up to pray to it regularly all the time and always have and it s really important to them oh really then there s the dialogue for the first pages or so it s mainly about trucks and cars talking about the ford f vs the f complaints about the bmw series have we ever known these things to be so important before that harry and her friends would spend pages talking about them not only is there a lot of talking about them brown inserts text explanations that sound as though they came out of an owner s manual for the vehicle and then we have the monk supposedly very devoted to his monastery visiting his family for thanksgiving who suddenly says land is the ultimate wealth you know and launches into a speech about the land that sounds like scarlett o haras daddy not a man who s devoted his life to god and things of the spirit for years i could tell who had committed the first murder within about minutes after we first hear about it and there s an irrelevant totally unforeseen and totally unnecessary plot twist at the end concerning one of the secondary continuing characters just comes out of thin air and then is brushed away as quickly what the i always endeavor to mention something i like well simon the possum makes a brief appearance in this one and so do a bunch of the barn mice i really enjoyed when they made fun on pewter by singing the old grey mare at her pewter is a fat grey cat you may recall summary even for dedicated series loyalists this is a tough one to swallow i won t bother reading the next one 
worthless picture book this is not a how to book this is a picture book the author is a consumate artist no doubt about that but the publishers have marketed it in such a way as to suggest that you the reader will learn how it can be done not true the author merely shows countless numbers of his own work this leaves you to guess how it can be done if you are a fan of the authors work then add this to your collection if you want a book on how to render lighting effects in your own work then pass this book bye 
inelegant ill written and unreliable having read kerry downes standard monographs on hawksmoor du prey s quotarchitecture and theology quot is very disappointing du prey does not to begin bring the book to its logical conclusion despite commencing with a gushing account of anglican divines in augustan england atterbury and aldrich though not rather surprisingly sacheverall the way in which contemporary religious thought might have conditioned the form of the churches built is inconclusive and not argued with the conviction that made an old article on the matter by du prey himself ie the basilicas of the primitive christians worthwhile furthermore broad out ofcontext and misleading generalisations such as a description of the tory party of as rightwing mixed with pockets of narrative make the book extremely irksome to read as if that were not bad enough du prey proves himself a brazen and misguided name changer st george intheeast becomes st george sintheeast whilst st alfege greenwich is nicely modernised as st alphege which is in fact in dioscean records a completely different church these observations might seem pedantic but such mistakes are quite surprising from a professor of architectural history du prey does not mention the churches of gibbs st mary lestrand st martin inthefields archer st john smith square westminster st paul deptford or john james st george hanover sqaure even though the latter collaborated on st john horselydown and st luke old street with hawksmoor himself ! neither of the churches not surprisingly are studied at all this is a flaw which kerry downes highlighted in a review of the book it ought to have elicited a little caution on my part because quotarchitecture and theology quot is definately not worth the asking price 
does not teach how to model i bought this book thinking it was going to teach me how to model a female character i was dead wrong ! this book does not teach anything about modeling the only thing it says to do is create a box and extrude following the sketch outline the programs covered in this book are mainly poser maya and photoshop they should call this book how to pose and texture a character in poser because that is really all this book tells you to do but if you want a book full of pictures of nude d models then by all means buy this book 
gregory disappoints once again what i find so troubling about many of gregory s books is her failure to present a heroine who isn t insipidly weak this book the favored child and the virgin s lover both spring to mind the favored child had great potential in terms of gregory s beautiful writing but julia s consistent inability to stand up to richard ruined the book for me i found the characters neither realistic nor sympathetic after pages of drama i quickly flipped to the last page and read julia s letter to james i immediately threw the book down because i was so disgusted i would ask gregory to write a book where the heroine actually has a backbone i understand that the modern mindset greatly colors my thinking when it comes to a woman s role in society but no one expects that degree of historical accuracy from pleasure reading such as this ill throw one bone to gregory her descriptions of bath were marvelous 
pages of torture would you stand in line at an applebee s for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good maybe better at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes of course not ! why then would you spend countless hours plowing through this page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books or a patterson and a connelly or two thomas harris books my apologies greg iles but for a simple formulaic serial killer book blood memory was just way too long the book has two co plots one involves a serial killer who murders older men the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting but at least two thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles or his editor had chopped out about pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for o or even pages but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera speak meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream taking showers and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it s some strange exotic treat that no one s ever heard of before just as some people love to hear themselves talk i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good blood memory misses the mark by a long shot 
same old same old this book has the same old information you have already heard i really did not like this book it had several items that are false in it like gorillas eat meat which they do not it has lots of negative information on various foods but offers no suggestions on where to buy an alternative product i just do not see the point of adding this book to your library or collection no new information whatsoever 
power of trivial writing it takes indeed some real power to get so many five star reviews for such shallow writing this book is a very poor way of handling thw well known concept of paradigms and paradigm shifts if you are at all familiar with these concepts simply forget buying this book as just because you paid money for it you will naturally be inclined to read it and this will be a total waste of time and energy there are so many books on creativity innovative thinking and innovation look for them this is a book on nothing was it a busines book on business models was it a cookbook for personal development what was this for god s sake apart from being an insult on iltelligence 
a disappointment some of the reacher novels such as the killing floor have been incredibly good but i was genuinely disappointed in this one the author describes reacher as heroic a loner etc but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told phrases such as back in the day get repeated much too often reacher has become a caricature of himself 
perhaps maybe suppose an entertaining though frustrating look at the victorian era wilson s habit of using words where will do and never writing an unequivical sentence grows old quickly and it is hard to keep track of where each chapter is going paragraphs and chapters do not segue neatly into one another while the book does discuss a lot of interesting ideas and people i can t help but think other books on the era must do so as well and in a more pleasing style of writing 
overlong and overwritten the message is good while i strongly agree with the message of this book i cannot recommend it the theme of the book is that you need to save part of your income and invest it to create wealth for your old age this agrees with the research in the book the millionaire next door cited by mr hanson that book through personal interviews shows that most self made multimillionaires lived on part of their income and invested the rest for high return the main weaknesses of good debt bad debt are repetitiveness and overwriting the author jon hanson says he wanted to be an author for many years when he told this to an english teacher he says she laughed uproariously he would have done well to have called her in to help with the volume the book could be in my judgment about one third as long with judicious editing and still convey most of the information contained i found it hard to read the last one third also the author self consciously and seemingly proudly coins new words and phrase as well as second lessons the writing itself is clear and there are very few typos the message is fine reduce your consuming being in the consumeratiand then invest with real estate being favored the author also shares some of his personal history including his own weakness in following this advice there are some brief descriptions of people who have good and poor savings patterns i d like to see more detailed case histories of people who changed from poor to good financial management and the results because of the repetitions some readers might find some ways of saying things a little clearer than others overall while i like the message i don t recommend reading this book to get it oh why does my review different from earlier ones i feel this author got shills to give him excellent reviews which in my view are not deserved only one of the four other reviewers have reviewed other books than this one and two of the three apparently shill reviewers are in the same state as the author suggesting people who know him so i recommend you ignore earlier reviews 
turgid and slow researching the history of race relations between korean americans and other groups i purchased this book because of its subject matter although it describes some key events in the la riots of the early s the writing leaves a great deal to be desired and the authors thesis is not well argued 
waste of time i think when silvia first started writing she was good but i m sorry her last few books including this one are sarcastic and weak the depth is not there and the joke cracking is out of line i learned nothing here like i did in her earlier books waste of money 
zoolander on the wagon interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring about half way through i had to quit it was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl will he call me did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me all i do is think about him is he thinking about me oh please please please let him say something to me i love you but i m not in love with you on and on the humor is mildly amusing but seems forced it doesn t ring quite true like the author is trying too hard an earlier negative reviewer said they didn t like the author it didn t prevent me from reading the book i like the writing of a number of unlikable people but i now understand the book is completely about this shallow person his struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting humane things about him his colleagues force him into rehab which turns his life around he returns to work a changed and invigorated man loving life but continues to mock the people who saved him it doesn t dawn on him to thank them 
full of information needs editing and focus the first four chapters of this book are very useful but they are short and jumbled the information in the appedicies is more useful than the rest of the text it provides an entires methodology for using programs to complete projects the biggest problem i see with this book is the grammatical errors at least two per chapter as well as spelling mistakes such as wonder ie people continuously wonder to and away from the presenter the word is wander these are doctors at penn state they should be able to spell anyway there is probably better books out there but this one was fairly inexpensive and does have alot of information 
would not recommend this book to anyone i was really surprised at how bad this book was it was terribly written and cheesy both of the main characters are completely unbelievable the author describes joshua seigl as though he were an year old man he is supposed to be in his late s he wears tweed caps and calls people darling even for a literary type completely off the mark his whole persona was like something out of the depression as for the tattooed girl this character was also annoyingly unbelievable no one under the age of uses the word jewess ever this book reminded me of a book that an adult wrote for children completely failing to grasp a certain time and place cheesy and overwritten but naturally i had to finish it and i was glad when i did 
poorly written according to amazon author paul a woods is among other things a researcher this is not apparent from reading this book i was not expecting a literary classic but at least some accuracy would have been nice much of the book reads like bad fanfiction the author introduces a jason voorhees who is willing to follow the requests of someone other than his mother jason also uses a hunting rifle as a hunting rifle rather than a club or spear the poor mischaracterization of the main character stands as the most glaring error in the book this is not the only error in the book however the author also introduces a laser pointer with the ability to burn flesh a caliber handgun and a pump action double barreled shotgun the ending of the book is forced and makes little sense it reads as though the author was told to hurry and decided to kill several characters out of spite waste of money and time 
this series is getting old now just finished reading this novel this morning and i think it is probably the weakest one of the lot like a lot of reviewers i didn t find this one anywhere near as gripping or well developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the stephanie plum series as well the supposed sexual tension love triangle between stephanie joe and ranger is approaching its use by date it is definitely becoming boring and i think ms evanovich needs to resolve stephanie s romantic situation once and for all i still enjoy characters like lula and grandma mazur but a lot of the situations stephanie found herself in fell flat with me there are only so many times she can have her car blown up handbag destroyed apartment broken into etc before it becomes tiresome and repetitive i still think there is a spark of life in the stephanie plum series but i hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by thenumbers as this one 
shallow characters snarky remarks i did not care about the people in this book it seems to want be a romance story but fails the writer sacrifices any chance of eliciting real feelings from his readers in favor of making sarcastic remarks disguised as cogent observations one particularly icky description of a first sexual encounter supposedly recounted by an elderly character does not have the ring of words being spoken and instead comes off as nothing but cheesy erotica writing additionally an entire scene at a shotgun wedding in the sticks replete with bitter bulging bride and fluffy lavender bridesmaid gowns a scenario that s been done to death is nothing but a bad excuse to take cliched potshots at the straight world i bought this based on a rave review from the ny times that appeared on the cover i do not know how this book received such a review the writing style is snappy and shows promise if only the author chooses to tackle a story with a bit more depth otherwise this book offers nothing more than a couple of brief moments of humor that is all 
crusader the wayfarer redemption book i found this book to be of little enjoyment i feel it strays to far from the rest of the series and leaves the reader with a dull and vague finality to the series 
quality of the delivered product while the reason for buying the book was met required text book for university study the condition of the delivered item was very substandard when the book arrived it was bent and creased and the front cover had been pushed in such a way that it was starting to come away from the spine the book was not secure in its packaging and was able to slide around inside the box scuffing both front and back covers i would not be happy if this happened to a book let alone a book that cost me aus i will seriously consider next time i need a book whether i will get it from amazon com the amount of money i saved was not worth the damage that occured to the item not happy 
poorly written copycat novel this book is a feeble attempt to reproduce a tom clancyesque type novel unfortunately this author has little writing ability and didn t even come close what a disappointment 
lives not worth living other reviews give a good sense of the concretes of this book so i ll just mention what struck me as the fundamentals the characters and i do mean all of them are pathetic thieves and murderers the setting is a dark pointless future containing not a single real person with a real life and the plot feels like a confusing tumble down a well although gibson is intelligent and quite creative he seems to enjoy creating difficult jargony prose muddying the waters so that they appear deep if this is one of the best in the cyberpunk genre then the genre is not for me 
not what i expected a bit cheesey i felt like i was reading a fluffed up self help book ! if you are a fan of the da vinci code looking for more information on the lost sacred feminine this book will be of little help i bought it because i thought it would be an interesting way to absorb some facts but i found it to be a simplistic repetetive overly idealized account of a woman s rebirth i couldn t even finish it while its okay as a light read it won t satisfy your want of solid religious historical information 
ruination dear god in heaven what a dreary little effort this is and what a disappointment after a simple plan great idea for a very short story bad idea for a novel in the end if you can finish the tome you ll be rooting for the plant to do its darnest and quickly 
fast paced but predictable while edgar winner walters psychological thrillers in the ruth rendell vein are among my favorites this is her weakest effort to date british war correspondent connie burns recognizes a sadistic mercenary while on assignment in iraq she had met the man while in sierra leone two years earlier and based on his reputation for brutality towards the native prostitutes suspected him of the vicious murders of five women though nothing came of her suspicions she immediately resumes her digging when she spots him in iraq under a different name his employers stonewall her investigation and shortly thereafter she is abducted then released after three days though she refuses to discuss her ordeal we know who grabbed her and as the book proceeds nothing about her horrible experience comes as a surprise traumatized she holes up in an old house in dorset where walters lives suffers panic attacks and edgily befriends a taciturn local woman who as a teenager lost her family in a car crash the predictable stalking by the kidnapper overshadows the subplot concerning this woman and the elderly owner of the dorset house while the protracted ending is first not credible and second way too talky a major disappointment portsmouth heral 
certainly a book for idiots this book was a waste of time and money the author spends nearly pages revealing things that are obvious to absolutely anyone he tell us how smiles usually mean happiness crying usually means you re sad and faces that look angry convey anger ! the writing style is painful to read i assume the writer is in his late s but trying to be hip and with it there are aweful jokes through out he also likes lists and bullets that outline painfully obvious body language rules to follow how do you tell if someone doesn t like how you re touching them are they wincing and flinching telling you to stop crying it really goes like this i couldn t finish this book you shouldn t start it 
not really interesting enough to be predictable a group of disaffected viet nam veterans cab drivers calling themselves green band blows up several buildings in a carefully orchestrated attack on wall street in the chaos they steal a large number of securities which they plan to sell in an attempt to ruin the american economy archer carroll a us anti terrorist agent for the dia teams up with the beautiful and multi talented caitlin dillon of the sec in trying to track down the mysterious organization that doesn t seem to have any specific demands theres plenty of action but none of it s very interesting and the story never really hooked me i finished it more out of curiosity than anything else and lack of something else to read and the characters while sympathetic aren t very well developed i couldn t understand why carroll who supposedly had a whole team of men reporting to him was the only one who was working on a case of such importance also there s a minor brazillian character at one point but she speaks spanish i thought everyone knew they speak portuguese in brazil overall marginally interesting but i m sure you can find something better to read 
just a bunch of chess articles i am rather disappointed after buying this book it contains just a bunch of articles about different chess topics illustrated mainly with the author games the articles are rather interesting and well written games well annotated but it is hard to find the idea behind the book as a whole i would rate it higher if it had title like alex yermolinsky selected chess articles but this book does not offer any organized plan of work towards reader chess improvement ohh there is suggestion to study own games on the beginning so i am just disappointed after buying it 
not the real thing this is just a watered down version by replacing the colorful language they have also taken away part of the beauty of the story i wish i had not wasted my money on this version 
success secrets of the online marketing superstars i bought this book for my wife but after having looked at it i should have bought some flowers instead the book was bilge water but for those who watch the gurus of e marketing the classic formula for e book selling has been followed to the letter really great ad copy to move the book sell the sizzle not the steak and use the book as a thinly veiled advertisement pushing the products of all the gurus who generously supplied content for the unititiated i would suggest this go to each of the websites of those marketers mentioned in the book or the teaser copy what you will find is the same names popping up on all of the different websites this is because they each act as an endorsement for the others product go to mitch s website and you will see the usual suspects endorsing this book as the greatest thing since sliced bread then go to one of their s and you will find mitch endorsing their product as the greatest thing since sliced bread it takes a while to spot the mechanics but before to long you to will learn the secrect too cross plugging and expert endorsements for fame and fortune it reminds me a little of the old shakesperian acting troupes where the same five or six actors toured together in each play it was the same actors only playing different parts i also suspect that those who have provided glowing reviews are either new to this game or are schmoozing for an endorsement of their own product by one of the big fish bottom line save your money and remember how this game works the next time you get one of those youve just got to see this emails touting a new product from one of the usual suspects this is how you take dishwater and turn it into an overnight best seller which ever one of these guys who s turn it is to shear the sheep this month simply has the other guys who are waiting their turn at bat blast their mail list with a glowing revue and a to good to resist offer the groupies and the newbies fork out the shekels enmasse while the gurus begin work on their sheep shearing best seller 
there is no storyline i bought this book because it was on my son s school summer reading list and he loves cars trucks buses etc however it has no storyline each page has one or two words that basically say nothing my son liked the pictures but the story didn t hold his attention at all 
disappointing i was really curious about angela davis but i found this book really boring it seemed really clinical and dry i ve read alot of autobiographies and this one was really disappointing she never really opened up 
skip this one i ve read most of sandra hill s books and i ve enjoyed the saga of the eriksson and magnusson families the story of madrene and ian is a disappointment hey try the drinking game or if you re like me the chocolate chip cookie game have one each time she mentions the size of madrene s breast or mentions the men and women who can t keep their eyes off them you ll either be totally drunk or gain pounds the story had so much potential with the navy seals and a beautiful viking warrior princess but this one fell short it had some funny parts but overall the humour found in her earlier books was missing 
too little too late i was very dissappointed with this book first of all the title is a little misleading taking the leap i was more interested in a book that would help me switch from my current job to a career as an artist this book is designed more to help the artist just starting out in his her career presumably just out of artschool to set realistic goals build a body of work and guide the artist through the business side of the artworld ie approaching galleries selling copyright and other legal stuff etc for what it actually is the book is about average clearly written easy to understand if not on occasion dumbed down for example the section on understanding who the major players are in the artworld includes such catagories as the artist you the collector the gallery owner including definitions for these terms seemed more like filler than actual usefull information another problem with the book is outdated information mainly where the internet is concerned but also when it comes to the sample resumes and artist statements the book has it s good points too as i said it s well written and easy to understand the section on photographing your artwork is a keeper as well as the guide for creating a submission package to send out to galleries if you have trouble with setting and keeping realistic goals for yourself this book will help you with that as well id be interested in finding out what s in lang s new book taking the leap which unfortunately i wasn t aware of until after i bought this one and at the time of writing this review it s still yet to be released i don t think i d invest the money in buying the new addition but i might breeze through it if i saw it at the book store 
descend into insanity page at a time in another rehashed treatise on savage s perverted sense of truth he sells a miserable peripatetic screed to his lemming like followers this man s politics and principles have been condemned by such well established conservative journals as the economist we all need someone to trust and for savage that person is the md who will prescribe him some thorazine gets stars only because of the book s educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic barry goldwater must be spinning in his grave 
horrifying hero i would have rated this book with no star if i could severin was such a horrific character forget about the rape scene what about the one where severin punished hastings for being jealous of lady marjorie by tying her to the ground and made her eat on the floor with his dogs in front of everyone in the dining hall is that supposed to be romantic this is suppposed to be a romance novel not strictly historical fiction as such there has to be some romantic element to the story but i found nothing romantic whatsoever between hastings and severin s relationship this is definitely the worst book i ve ever read bar none ! 
wow this product really sucks i was very interested in this product when i read the description however after recieving the product was disappointed to find that way in which you catch a liar is to become a bigger and more manipulative liar if you have any sense of intergrity ignore this product the author must me one of the biggest decievers out there to put such effort in this product 
a story betrayed by it s author maybe at the time it was written i would have reviewed it more favorably in light of the life miller led i can t help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play here miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism then miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole usa the very capitalist society that was supposedly willy s oppressor i think the years have taken the shine off of miller a bit i m sure the liberal literature professor will disagree 
the truth about burnout i read this book in my local libary and found it very interesting it also applies to government which have become infected with consultants and quotreformquot fads another good book was quotthe witch doctors making sense of management gurus we already survived tqm and now are going throug quotreinventionquot which was supposed to be all done in to years now years later it takes x the number of people to do half the work in twice the time this is is causing burnout in a lot of people i ll buy the book when it comes out in paperback 
dreadfully boring how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of and turn it into a tedious snooze fest one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding 
oh snap what is with this trend of good kid s books being followed up by seemingly rapidly produced poorly thought out sequels as bad as sequel s are in american cinema i think sequels in children s books are even worse we loved five little monkeys jumping on a bed cute pictures the fun bouncy lines of the old kid s song plus an opportunity to practice counting and there is a lesson there kids don t jump on the bed the book legitimizes the temptation especially at the end when we see the mother taking her turn to jump on the bed but the monkeys fall off one by one momma calls the doctors and we see the monkeys lines up with there ice bags on their heads in their post concussive stupors but we recently got five little monkeys sitting in a tree the helpful everyday lesson for kids in this book is don t taunt a crocodile okay perhaps one could generalize this and interpret it as a useful aphorism for navigating hierarchies but doesn t quite live up to the standard of the nice concrete no more monkeys jumping on the bed but beyond the pointlessness of this book it s terrifying although in the end it is revealed that the monkeys do not get eaten by the crocodile and on subsequent readings one spots them hiding in the tree which is slightly clever we spend of the pages thinking that some or all of the mischievous monkeys have been eaten by mr crocodile we see nice colorful illustrations of distressed relatives including the frantic mother sobbing inconsolably i know i ve been told i take these books too seriously maybe your children won t be as traumatized as i was i don t know maybe it s a good way to teach math and i suppose also an opportunity to teach about the cruel pitiless realities of the animal kingdom and to teach that the inherent nature of life is suffering ultimately these are important lessons for the toddlers just a bit heartless and harrowing for my taste 
not at all what i expected i thought this book would be more technical with more details about glass itself it s really just about the renaissance and greek revival i can remember reading many pages without the word glass even being mentioned ! if i wanted to discuss the origins of science i would have read a book titled that not a book called glass i expected the book to actually be about glass ! i m actually dreading finishing this book 
painfully bad writing i was assigned this book as preparation for an a p english class and i was incredibly disappointed with it although it features some stirring stories of bravery and compassion hence the two stars every word of it is poured over with syrup and then carelessly vomited onto the page only about half of the words in this book are necessary at all to the context of the stories it tells the rest are flag waving literary masturbation consider sentences like these millions of men and women were involved in this tumultous journey through adversity and achievement despair and triumph certainly there were those who failed to measure up but taken as a whole this generation did have a rendezvous with destiny that went well beyond the outsized expectations of president roosevelt when he first issued that call to duty in yes i get it grandma and grandpa were great ! now please sir learn how to structure a sentence ! most of the rest of the book is mindlessly self indulgent treacle in this repetitive vein how this man got a book deal is comprehensible to me only because i know how famous brokaw is but how any sadly misinformed american bought this book is more than beyond me please if you respect yourself as a human being do not buy this book

the labrador shooting dog if you like stories then this is the book for you gould does not discuss training until you are half way through the book the training starts with introducing the dog to the field and the waist cord you will do better to look elsewhere for more in depth training information especially if you need to start training at the basic level of come sit and stay i would recomend game dog by wolters he is precise and compasionate in his training techniques 
more than minutes just a warning minutes doesn t count warm up stretching or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise something that i find really annoying and ineffecient ! i have not read jeorge s book i got the routine from an excerpt in o ! i don t understand why he doesn t pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing it s such a pain getting up and down up and down plus i feel like you lose that whole idea of no rest i m sure i expend more calories to get up an down but it s all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself i have been following ww while i have been doing the m workout more like for me and i have not lost one pound i ll keep doing it because it s probably better than nothing but i m not impressed so far about weeks 
and the point was i was excited to read the book because it talked about even how unattractive or intelligent women can be seductresses however all the author talked about was how the various artists intellectuals and adventurers used sex to get what they wanted from men basically the author reduces women to physical beings and tries to justify this treatment by comparing the women in her book to the sumerian goddess inanna there was no everlasting love for these women a myth if there ever was one and then prioleau claims that if women reclaim their sexual selves they will gain the everlasting love that has been eluding them essentially the book is bs and i wouldn t give this book to anyone i would actually advise friends and family members to avoid it at all costs it just perpetuates the image of women as sexual creatures to be used by men in exchange for power money fame and security 
already in citizenship papers these nice and thoughtful essays were already in berry s citizenship papers essays i wish i had known that before i bought both 
not even for alas i ve joined the group of dispointed consumers ! i love alton brown but this so called quotbookquot is less way less than steller i actually saw this at chapters for and couldn t bring myself to part with the twoonie required to purchase it all the previous reviews sun up my feelings but i just had to add my two cents 
not at all what i was expecting i am a professional pet stylist and when i saw this book advertised in one of the groomer magazines i immediately went to amazon to purchase it i was excited to see that someone had actually written a book addressing the issues of grooming mixed breeds a ka mutts unfortunately i was severely disappointed this book provides no real information the author uses drawings of dogs she has groomed in the past these drawings are only a side view and no drawing of the all important head is included i am giving this book stars instead of only because the author at least attempted to write a book about mutts the author simply suggests that you as a groomer determine what pure breeds the mutt resembles and then groom accordingly i can tell you that in my shop i see many mutts that are impossible to determine their lineage i was hoping this book detailed the different requirements of grooming a mutt such as providing details of creating a teddy bear head on a shih tzu or how to set up a mane when doing a strip on an alaskan husky the book is short on details and actually gave me no new information or tips that are not readily available in any one of dozens of pure bred grooming books i cannot recommend this book to professional groomers as there is no detail and the drawings are sadly lacking i certainly would not recommend this book to the grooming doityourselfer as there is no information concerning the basics of grooming such as proper bathing and brushing etc dont experience the buyers remorse i am experiencing i absolutely do not recommend buying this book 
nothing learned here can sum this book up in one word disappointing there is nothing artistic in any of the pictures no commentary given as amuturistic as nude photos can be 
expensive advertisement this book does describe how to wet pan dry pan and a few other things but it is a very expensive advertisment for garrett metal detectors and the quotnewquot plastic pan very disappointed in content pictures are ok but not worth the money 
disappointing self centered and unchallenging after multiple shopping excursions leave her captivated with amish dolls and quilts affluent american sue bender attempts to impose herself on an amish family in order to use their community as a personal spiritual retreat the result was a pseudo spiritual journey that gave rise to this short self indulgent ethnocentric work needless to say that sue bender is not an ethnographer she is we are repeatedly reminded an artist and plain and simple is not an ethnography however in between vapid musings bender squeezes in a few pages about of the book recounting some of the experiences she had while living with two amish families for a few months this is the part of the book that s actually interesting during her stay bender even manages to cast off a few of her prejudgments and sterotypes about the amish people and their culture although she admits that she expected a prompt spiritual revolution her instrospectional conclusions are still tidy and conciliatory she resolves that it is tragically not in her nature to be calm and then labels this epiphany as triumphant progress such is the depth of her revelations that she contradicts herself when describing them bender s pap analysis of the amish identifies several paradoxes in science the emergence of paradoxes tends to indicate a flawed theoretical model but sue bender instead chooses to cling to her convenient superficial interpretations of the multifaceted amish ethos which she regards as a novelty having learned so much from an amish community in iowa bender proceeds to simulate the experience by remodelling her modern kitchen entirely in synthetic materials years later but only a few paragraphs after comparing herself to a zen monk she finally admits that cultivating a focused amish like calm might actually require some sort of inward self actualized change at least that s something maybe sue bender will grace us all with a follow up work in which she experiences another spiritual awakening while hat shopping in tibet 
dangerous information i really liked the book the drawings are great and the words are fun i was rappeling not too long ago using the prusik to make me safe like they do on the cover of the book the prusik tightened onto the rope just at the end of my reach and i was hanging from the one loop around my leg it was really uncomfortable and it took me a long time to get free i asked a guide friend and he showed me two much safer ways to do the setup now i have to wonder if the book has more dangerous mistakes because this one was on the front cover 
the invisible woman denmark fancies himself a real tough guy because he grew up in the tough brownsfield district and because he was named after slave revolt leader denmark vesey okay denmark is married to a ghost of a woman named sierra she starts off as a ghost to the reader and is still a ghost at the end of the book who was she what did she want what did she like how did she feel about being placed on a pedastal like some kind of plaster cast mannequin what did she think about the life she had in which she wasn t even a real woman just some breathing fantasy come to life denmark doesn t seem to know or care she cheats on him he gets real real mad why he is so mad about losing a woman that he doesn t even care to get to know is never made clear but he is real real mad so mad that he sets out to get revenge by sleeping with every woman he knows even if her man is one of his friends things get ugly the only good thing about this book is that sierra escapes her cage hopefully she will find a real man 
he gets important stuff wrong i come with an axe to grind i wrote two playwriting books of my own but one of the reasons i wrote them is because i found so much in this one so wrong headed the idea of starting with a theme or intellectual premise is so bass ackwards as to be jaw droppingin my experience you don t start with a theme you find yourself attracted to characters in a situation that compels you to explore them and it sometime during the middle of the writing if you re writing honestly you may find out what the play s theme is but theme should emerge organically not be imposed from the beginning to start with theme is like trying to build a skyscraper from the top down it may be where you want to go but like building a building you need to start with scaffolding and a foundation i trust that when i m grabbed by character and situation that there has to be some underlying thematic pull i don t want to force finding what this is out too early if i surprise myself a little i have a good chance of surprising and delighting the audience now there is a different craft to writing the first draft and doing rewrites i suspect that some of egri is more applicable to the second stage so yes obviously i prefer my own books the dramatist s toolkit and solving your script also thornton wilder wrote a terrific short essay on the subject in which he talks about the differences between writing fiction and drama since he is the only writer to have won the pulitzer prize for both he comes to the subject with credibility i mean when is the last time you saw a production of an egri play announced 
good zeal bad science this book is revealing a typical young earth creationism yec these people have a good and great zeal to defend the christian faith i commend them for that but i must say in a loving way that their method is unscientific it is misleading and untruthful we cannot defend truth by using part truth either way this is still lying ! how can anyone defend a good cause with bad tools this will destroy the christian witness of the gospel as a theologian and scientist i must refute the young earth creationist movement many christian leaders and theologians are opposing young earth creationism because of their lies the scientist community including christian scientists rejects the kind of pseudoscience promoted and distributed by yec today the evidence against young earth creationism yec continues to accumulate this leads inevitably to a general conclusion against all christianity i am so grieved when i see atheists laughing at the kind of science that is propagated by yec christ s name is being hurt why do young earth creationists have to twist facts and lie so much well the answer is simple they do not have any evidence in science whatsoever ! then they have to invent it somehow this is how they do it they say god created the universe this is right by using usher s genealogy they believe the bible says the earth is young the bible does not say that then they say we have to prove what we believe by means of science after all god created science but the science is not helping them then they are forced to dig around to find any flaws in science that they can use and abuse they continue by accumulating anything they can find to make a case bits and pieces of unresolved issues like little discrepancies in scientific data and so on by using scientific language and their degrees in science they go out of their fields of expertise and continue their propaganda by misinterpreting and manipulating scientific data twisting and ignoring facts misquoting various writers using the wrong tools for different kinds of measurements etc this is lying if they find one discrepancy out of lets say one hundred they choose to ignore the in order to stress the one that fits their theory this is not integrity do you call this science by doing sound apologetics we need to bring the unbelieving scientists to faith in christ unfortunately this kind of yec propaganda is doing exactly the opposite one day they will be held responsible before god zeal is not enough you need wisdom too yec do not have any ! this is sad 
hearsy to disprove hearsay the author of this iconoclastic text claims that the sinclair legacy in scotland is based on hearsay and then he proceeds to use hearsay to try and disprove it i bought the book to learn about the sinclairs and rosslyn and came away knowing not what they are but what they aren t 
what i don t why anybody liked this book the story line wasn t bad it was just that is was way to vague and not enough interaction with the characters i mean there is hardly any conversation at all 
better for a good laugh than anything thankfully i found this book at a secondhand store so i didn t pay much for it it is not worth the money granted there are a few good tips included but the really ridiculous bad tips far outweigh the good ones for example budget for fresh flowers okay not everyone can do this some people have bills that need to be paid instead put a small refrigerator in your bedroom for chilled glasses and strawberries if your house is too big to pop into the kitchen for these items then you need a maid to bring you chilled glasses besides honestly who wants a refrigerator in the bedroom not me ! she mentions that one of her friends leaves beef tips simmering on the stove in her apartment whilst she is at work hello fire hazard ! when she was sick with a mild case of the flu she got an armload of magazines and called the florist to have a hyacinth sent over must not have been very sick forgive me for saying it but really i have never had a hyacinth sent over when i was sick and doubt that i ever will mark on your calendars to have your knives professionally sharpened twice a year im doing good if i can remember to schedule to have my teeth cleaned twice a year knives i don t think so ! on top of these and myriad other laughable tips she name drops throughout when i was so andso in the luxurious hotel so andso with peter for relaxation and beauty or my actress friend mrs x does so andso i don t care where she has been or who her friends are i wanted nice sensible tips for daily living that commoners which i m sure i would be in her eyes could relate to i didn t find that here she also goes onto a tangent about obesity in america in the bathroom section i have no idea where it came from but it really took up a lot of my reading time it was unnecessary and had nothing to do with how a bathroom could contribute to a beautiful life she really gets off course a lot so i won t be reading mine over or trying to sell it to anyone else i figure my copy will go straight to the trash which incidentally is not a white wicker basket 
nothing spectacular unfortunately for all the name brand that this book conveys i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales boggles this readers mind the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book i would be astounded save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation by the way those giving stars either can t read english very well or are shills for mckinsey 
way overrated when i bought the book i did not know that they already made a movie out of it but i learned about it later on so i was really excited when i started to read it also because other comments were really good unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all first the story development is really slow it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens second several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly the worst part of the book though is its style it does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime he she gets an extensive characterization most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about pages shorter but even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter couldn t it still be an interesting book unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well the detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than pages on top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is and wonder why you need to go through over pages to find out officially conclusionif you are a psychologist and or like in depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you but for those of you who like fast paced stories ample twist and turns surprises action thrilling developments and or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time please do not come anyway near it watch the movie instead this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in hours 
more a mystery than a comedy this is a rudderless work for the life of me i can t figure out why it s so often performed it s as if the work were written on commission every single act bears the mark of duty james yanni comes close below when he remarks that there is little to recommend this play that wouldn t likewise recommend almost any of shakespeare s comedies i think the problem more precisely is that the devices used to such wonderful effect in shakespeare s other comedies shipwrecks twins transvestitism are deployed here to no effect at all there is not a single sympathetic character in this play everyone is obsessed with either booze or money the fool is more annoying than amusing the rushed climactic scene in which orsino having pined for olivia for five acts turns his love abruptly to viola whom he has never seen outside her male disguise speaks to how urgently shakespeare must have wanted to put the finish on this awful mess and bring down the curtain for a taste of shakespeare s comedic power read well read any other comedy he wrote 
a letter to sean hannity dear sean thanks for sending me your book deliver us from evil defeating terrorism despotism and liberalism before i put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep i just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me let me get this straight you d like to see all liberals vanish from the face of the american political system and have only conservative republicans running the show is that right hmm let me see if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system there was the soviet union fascist italy nazi germany those are three just off the top of my head they didn t like liberalism either well sean i got to get going i m sure i ll write again soon all my best billps remember fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
not a strong point for naipaul i am a huge fan of v s naipaul the premise of this book exploring the effects of the colonial situation upon the lives of three men is excellent however this book is a confusing conglomeration of three separate and unrelated stories and there were times when i found myself wondering what was going on i love naipaul s flair for narrative and description but the sections on miranda are almost entirely dialogue with lots of obscure references i actually skipped over the last section on miranda because i just could not get through it whereas normally i am unable to put down naipaul s books not one of his best works in fact i don t recommend it to anyone aside from those hardcore fans who are determined to read everything this great novelist has ever written 
warning magic decoder ring not included as a graduate student in history i was intrigued by sahlins subject however sahlins does his best to hide his subject from any reader not in the club i e anyone who does not speak the jargon of a structuralist or post structuralist anthropologist sahlins is a very inaccessible and is thus by most rules of writing a bad writer whose elitist attitude negates any interest i may have had in his subject matter 
i can t stand this woman this was the only bertrice small book i could find in the gift shop of an airport that should have been warning enough not to buy it rosamund was an unlikeable character she left her young daughters so she could make love constantly and then was oh sosuperior with her maid when annie did the same ! i guess being a rich snotty noblewoman means you re not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help i found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived small s readers are smarter than most so i m surprised she expected us to swallow it like some other reviewers here i thought it was more lust than love it was clearly a mid life crisis hook up for patrick and if rosamund truly loved patrick she never would have left him when he was ill memory loss or not not planning to read either rosamund or phillipa the other books in this series it was hard enough getting through this book let alone another one with her uppity daughter the good stuff getting to meet patrick leslie again but it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter janet decades ago if you ve read the kadin you know that janet eventually returns to her home but only after patrick has died 
it s not that bad then again it s not too good either if this is your first barbara taylor bradford book you may never pick up another one i on the other hand like to give an author the three strikes rule so won t hesitate to try something else but it won t be very soon if you want to read one of her novels do not start with this one like i did this is very boring like snails serving as soap stars not to mention slow and predictable i listened to the entire thing on cd but think it was mostly because i liked ms o karmas narration she has an appealingly smokey voice like carolyn jones from the adams family it still couldn t save this story with its endless self serving whataboutme mantras and valentine s overly moralistic attitude i m the same way and i bore myself you knew from page one where this story was going and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper i was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me resounds every other page yet she wants to get away from all of that nothing s worse than a character or real person who brags then turns around and screams look at me look at me how dare you look at me 
you can do it jonathan pond doesn t provide a financial game plan he rehashs the obvious information readily available the disappointment in the end is that his advertised website becomes another pay for service 
pretty crappy in my opinion not only are the things listed in this book cheap trinkets but most everything in the book you have to pay or for the stuff you do not have to pay shipping for are useless pamphlets and literature there are a few things that are pretty cool and possibly some useful information for some folks but most everything is junk plus a lot of the things listed are repeated through the book its like the author needed to add stuff and thought nobody would notice that several of the things were repeated overall this page booklet was not worth the paper it was printed on if you are interested in getting free things i would suggest finding freebie message boards on the internet 
replacing old stereotypes with new ones this book is as much about the gypsy communities as it is about confirming the author s own preconceived notion of what eastern europe is or what is not in her own words certainly not a melting pot i will not comment on how the author deals with the main subject of her book on the gypsy communities its cultural heritage and its current problems as a romanian i am ashamed i know very little about it and i was hoping to find out some answers by reading this book i did not there is one point where i agree on with the autor when she deplores the absence of this subject from the public debate and modern scholarship let me now say what this book excels at a lack of scholarship the author does a poor job identifying her sources the century of eastern europe as seen through the eyes of this author is full of surprises to give just one example the princes of the teritories that would become romania made great fortunes of war supplying food to constantinople this is quite funny given the intricate politics among the ottoman empire and the various genoese and venetian principalities that controlled the trade in the area at that time what is more surprising is the almost random insertion of this statement in the context of the book b to donwright plagiarism one chapter of her book is entitled temptation to exist which is the famous title of a book by the romanian author emil cioran name dropping cannot replace bibliography and this is unfortunately one of the more annoying habits of romanian scholars that the author seemed to have taken to c to insulting ignorance is she aware of the sympathy of young cioran for the iron guard movement in the is paraphrasing a fascist sympathizer appropriate in a book about opressed minorities d to cold war cliches to the people of the balkans the ursars gypsies travellers with dancing bears must have been a wonderful sight in the grueling last years of communism for some reason in ceausescu s romania people continue to pay money a bit assuming isnt it well what else were doing romanians during communism gymnastics nastase sucking their own blood perhaps since even even the literacy of the average romanian is subject of mockery eto selective century history here again the evil spirit of eastern european chauvinism is the obvious cause of all the evils of the century if it weren t for other standard choices nazy germany etc how about mussolini there is not one mentionabout mussolini and the fate of gypsies in italy for various reasons perhaps some or many of them good the author hates the country i am from sometimes i do too but i think a writer an intellectual should always be ready to engage in dialogue and thus set an example rather than labelling people who did not benefit from the same schooling as the author did as ignorant folk on the contrary this author does not permit even her close romanian asisstant so much as a tentative revelation on the subject these are the author s own words not to mention that she misspelled her name twice in the acknowledgement finally i have a recommendation if you want to know more about gypsies and eastern europe check out emir kusturica s brilliant movies 
a history of the same tired stuff intelligent design is ultimately an intellectually dead end this is the large elephant in the living room of mr woodward and mr johnson what is the practical use of a theory such as this in what ways does it lead to expanding humankind s knowledge to simply avoid answering this adds nothing to the quotargumentquot for intelligent design what great predictions will i d give us in the end i find this history lacking in that it provides no real reason to use i d as a productive approach to science 
another unfortunate representation as much as america needs a real understanding of the indochina conflict this work falls drastically short the sources sighted are the typical biased rationalizations void of depth and understanding anyone with an elementary wish to finding truth in mid to late twentieth century indochina has merely to check whether actual primary participants were used in the construction of this work clearly they were not as an examination of american political decision making it may have certain merit it is however impossible to gain a full understanding of the decisions without knowledge of the depth of the situations this book does not do that clips taken out of context from the frus foreign relations of the united states compilations are not a substitute for scholarly research this work is long on pages but short on understanding 
buy it used or not at all i ll start out by saying that this book had a co writer that s not usually the end of the world but in this case it seemed to make everything sort of wooden and unfeeling not that i expected much more from an investing book it was a triumph i laughed i cried ! but this was really at the edge of readability in my book which leads me to two huge pet peeves which were violated in this tome first penultimate means next to last some people even to those that ultimate means last think penultimate means very last or really the conclusion last but it doesn t it means next to last i learned this in school in th or th grade when we read some knights of the round table stuff le morte d arthur the green knight i think and others uther pendragon was king arthur s predecessor and he was in shallowly veiled allusion the pen dragon meaning the one before the dragon who was arthur so remember penultimate is not last the other complaint which is somewhat esoteric is on the definition of inflection point inflection points are not places where the graph or plot peaks at highs or lows inflection points are specifically where the rate of change shifts from positive to negative for example if the market grew at in year then grew in year then grew in year then grew in year then grew in year then lost in year then lost in year the inflection point would not be sometime between year and the inflection point would actually be between year and when the rate of change of value stopped increasing and started decreasing another way to rememeber it is when the graph shifts from concave up to concave down if your graph can hold water like a cup it s concave up and the other part is concave down i m not explaining it too well but if you really care check out an algebra textbook or google it i checked other investing sources about this to see what they say and most have confusing definitions like a point on a chart that marks the beginning of a significant move either up or down that s sort of true but it seems to reinforce the neff like definition of an inflection point which is when the market stops going up and starts going down ok done with that rant believe it or not i actually thought this book was pretty good the first part is a sort of autobiographical piece about how he found himself as a fund manager the rest of the book is about what his fund did through every major market event from the beginning until the s a side effect of his windsor fund summary is that it s essentially a summary of every major market event for the last years i admit i started skimming in the late s only because i ve read other market histories lately it was good if that s what you re looking for being a person that felt the pain of a huge stock market correction in remember i was the guy that thought i was diversified because i held most of my money in fidelity select technology i enjoy reading histories of other huge market people that say everything has changed since things like the intelligent investor was written are up there with people that say value investing is dead neither is right long term so despite being annoyed at the little things this was an interesting read this is another book that i wouldn t recommend until you ve read some of the classics first though i give it a weak buy 
piece of those other reviewers are probably people that helped write the book i had to search all over to find the right instructions to each exercise some of them were so complicated i couldn t even do them i m in pretty good shape but how can you sit on a bench holding a five pound weight with your feet and lift your legs up without falling backward plus there were too many exercises for one workout i think you could spend much less time and get better results joyce says that these workouts take thirty minutes but it took me an hour to get one workout completed thats how long they are the only good thing about this book were the pictures but that s a given that in a weightlifting book that you need pictures the other thing that i didn t like about this particular fitness book was the eating plan the author had set up in the book come on guys ! we all finally know that pasta and starches are not going to make you thin ! they ll just add more insulin to your body which will turn into fat and therefore make it much harder for you to to burn the fat you already have but back to the book joyce should have done her research more carefully and made the instructions easier for us readers 
patterson readers beware of this dog the only explanation is that james paterson churned this dog out to make a buck i ve read a number of james patterson books and while i m not a hard core fan i ve enjoyed most of them i know this will outrage some patterson readers but i m not much of a fan of alex cross who frankly i find boring as hell as mediocre as patterson often is as an author readers should beware london bridges is especially bad the novel reads like an abridgement moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense the premise is ridiculous super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders sounds like the plot for an austin powers movie without any of the humour patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market an author who churns out or novels a year doesn t have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller the twists at the end hes the wolf no he s the wolf no she s the wolf no by the end i just didn t care james patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware quantity not quality seems to be patterson s priority these days london bridges is a mess from beginning to end 
for heavens sake i cannot say i enjoyed this book largely because the main character joseph reaveley seemed to me to be self absorbed and oddly moralistic in his approach to the horrors of war and the challenge of defending what often seems entirely indefensible for example there is the rotten war correspondent who forces though heaven knows why a courtmartial of a poor wounded soldier who may or may not have deliberately maimed himself to get out of the trenches and tunnels he was wounded in it is never quite clear why in the face of no evidence of self mutilation this fellow is courtmartialed and possibly we never know likely to be hung it is apparently because morality and honor require this then when this same correspondent turns up dead with everyone thinking it couldn t have happened to a nicer fellow saint chaplain reavely takes it upon himself to find out if he was murdered and if so by whom this in the midst of trench warfare poison gas and then the idiocy of gallipoli where joseph appears to confront another war correspondent who thinks the stupidity of that battle should be reported oh no says our joseph who is horrified that anyone in england should know of this and tries to stop him risking his own death how incredibly brave as well as that of another poor wounded fellow who of course is ready and willing to die because joseph knows best then of course there is joseph s moral outrage at his sister who is chastely yearning for a general and his courageous decision to ruin his best friend s life because doing so is the morally defensible and right thing to do despite the fact that joe knows what his friend did was necessary to save england from the truth of the horrors of war really this was the most disappointing of this series joe s previous moralizing was a bit much but tolerable this one was way over the top and thoroughly unbelievable 
quotpoor spiritual knowledge by the author quot in john coleman s book the committee of his publisher has book advertisements for some occultic topics the worst being nostradamus nostradamus constantly used astrology as verified in his book preface in quotthe centuries quot if a reader wants to know more about whats going on by a christian source might i recomend dennis l cuddy s book quot secret records revealed quotor joan veon books both very strong christian authors 
weak effort we recently heard laurie david speak and purchased this book later i can t say we got much out of it first i guess you can say it is compact but that is because there are only pages of content second if you ve not lived in a cave for the last year you have to be somewhat familiar with the basic issue of global warming i recognize that is largely due to laurie s role in an inconvenient truth a defining event in raising public conciousness short advice spend you money on a donation to nrdc or buy world changing and skip this book 
sometimes the classics can be boring oh well sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance a loosely constructed story held together by ideas rasselas johnson and candide voltaire are much better and worth a look meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast the ideas are quaint and silly the writing stylized and artificial the characters impossible the plot preposterous you have better things to do with your time like sleep 
convoluted and lame plot definitely not his best i have been reading the navajo mysteries for the first time in chronological order i was sad when each ended and could barely wait to get the next one from the library until this one the plot is convoluted and far fetched with a lot of holes and i found the setting ugly and depressing especially the character of the hit man this is the second hit man hillerman s given us who owes it all to his unhealthy attachment to a disfunctional mama hmmmm i skimmed the last chapters because i was tired of both the book and the setting i just wanted it to see how it ended and be done with it because i was not enjoying the experience as i usually do so as other reviewers have advised don t start here 
more a reference than a good read this book is not easy to read it reads like an encyclopedia and a bad one at that i could only bear a few hundred pages of it before i felt that i was wasting my time only for the serious medical history student 
good songs but book is not very user friendly i ve been a they might be giants fan for several years and i am about to become a teacher so i have been perusing many children s books lately and decided to check out bed bed bed i listened to the book with the cd and the thing that stuck out at me the most about this book was the pacing impossible is the longest song but all its lyrics are crammed into two spreads while listening i found myself becoming bored looking at those pages so long at that point the book just seemed like a decorated lyrics page happy doesn t have to have an ending though only spreads including the title page was much better paced because of its fast tempo idlewilds three spreads were perfect since it was a short song with few words however bed bed bed was a whopping spreads long even though its time length was just a bit shorter than impossible i know it s the title song and should probably have more emphasis but in this case it meant that i had to flip through one line pages so quickly that i didn t even have time to glimpse at the pictures if i wanted to keep up with the song ! i would have much rather had more images of the shape shifting imaginary creatures in impossible than individual pictures of kids doing things like brushing their teeth and sitting around i got this book thinking that it would potentially make a unique addition for a listening center in my classroom but if i had such a hard time keeping up with the book i imagine my students would be even more frustrated if only a few changes were made this book would be much better but for now if i want a visual representation of they might be giant s kid songs i ll stick to here come the abc s 
dull dull dull in this book james hansen manages the impossible by making the journey of the first men to the moon unbelievably dull ! part of the problem lies with the subject neil armstrong comes across as an intensely private man modest to a fault and unwilling to dish the dirt on his colleagues time and again when asked about some of the controversies that have arisen from the apollo program he refuses to be drawn and usually gives some self effacing response or gives obscure convoluted technical explanations it makes for a frustrating read the space program aside armstrong appears to have led a fairly uneventful life during his detailing of armstrong s combat duty in korea hansen is reduced to writing about the other more exciting missions experienced by his fellow fliers or reeling off endless reams of statistics to pad out some not very interesting events perhaps unsurprisingly the book only comes to life during the description of apollo s mission and even then one has to wade through paragraphs of technical jargon i realise that to some extent this is unavoidable but then i remember that jim lovell s book about apollo lost moon later retitled because of the movie was similarly full of technical info yet it never felt dull and in fact gripped me from beginning to end overall first man was a disappointing experience i normally plough through books very quickly but found this one a real struggle to stick with i have to admit that before i got to the appollo section i had put it aside for a few weeks as i was fed up with it i replaced it with dear boy tony fletcher s wonderfully entertaining biography of keith moon i came back eventually but was left feeling that there must be a better book out there about the apollo astronauts 
disappointed again i think like many readers of the anita blake series one question keeps coming to mind why do i continue to read her the reason is that there is always hope that the series will shift again laurel k hamilton has invested a great deal in anita she is a necromancer a succubus and a panwere with a very convoluted and confusing personal life she is also a federal marshal licensed to handle preternatural crimes that is the part of these stories that captured many readers however laurel k hamilton has not been paying any real attention to anita s job and has focused instead upon the ardeur the power that makes anita a succubus i tend to find this aspect of anita the most uninteresting and this novel is no exception we have some new characters which promise some intrigue in the vampire world but nothing ever comes of it two of jean claudes friends arrive to help celebrate an all vampire dance troupe both of them have ulterior motives for coming and cause some problems but we don t focus on that merlin the leader of the dance troupe makes a power play against six vampire masters but we don t focus on that instead we have many sex scenes some of which are just far too long and descriptive the plot seems to stop whenever this happens and therefore the story never really gets going this was the exact same problem in the last two or three anita blake novels i love the character of anita i have enjoyed watching her deal with her growing powers and her growing understanding of herself while trying to deal with some interesting preternatural criminal but the last few novels have been solely focused on her growing powers and the problems they create my problem is that there has been no resolution to these problems anita has stopped growing and changing and is becoming whiny and uninteresting in the preview of harlequin we find out that edward is returning we haven t seen him since obsidian butterfly since that was also the last anita blake novel i could recommend to someone i have hope that the series will shift into something worh reading we can still hope which is why we re still buying her books 
reuters fired author joe maguire for being a bias liar joe maguire never takes on any of ann s remarks and so called lies he just babbles on endlessly about how much he really hates her that s it that s the whole book the best thing about this book is that it got joe maguire fired from reuters ! now he ll have some time to think about why it s wrong to lie maybe he can even find some time to polish up on his neo liberal goose stepping 
not the best book on wpf this book was obviously rushed to market while charles excellent writing style almost makes up for the lack of illustrations organization and layout it does fall short i highly recommend windows presentation foundation unleashed wpf unleashed by adam nathan instead adam is every bit charles equal in writing clear prose and both he and the publisher went the extra mile and a few months work to get it right 
well thought poorly written the quest for the limits of deduction is a well precedented and exciting topic and is worth of deep study if this is your opinion then this book is worth glancing at certainly chaitin s unique approach to tackling the notion of incompleteness cuts to the core of the matter and is free from the beautiful self referential chains that bind the reader from a clear understanding of godel s first and second incompleteness theorems even so chaitin s opinions of science his iconic worship of leibniz and consequent condemnation of newton his accusative implication that godel s contributions to deductive logic are overblown and confusing make this book difficult to read on the one hand chaitin appears to be a haughty mathematician reaching to mask his low self esteem he constantly references his teenage work and the technical reading that he was able to accomplish at the age of these comments are ostentatiously interweaved into a forest of exclamation points and the thesis that he alone understood and extrapollated on leibniz s understanding of algorithmic complexity i believe that this book is very much about an author desperately trying to establish his legacy as a great mathematician and not just a simple read about the limits of knowledge if you can stomach pages of writing from a self aggrandizing braggart establishing himself as leibniz s natural successor in the understanding of information and have a deep need to understand the notion of incompleteness in a new and innovative light then i recommend this book only to you 
meh been there read that for the most part not a bad book per se but the least helpful i have read 
awful i actually threw this book out i never do that but i d already wasted my money and i didn t want to waste any more of my time or that of anyone else its so terribly put together typos galore on every page sawyerisms double spaced as space fillers no original thinking and simple regurgitation of info readily available ive also never felt so compelled to write a review and this marks my first ps i would ve given it stars but that unfortunately wasn t a choice 
really really bad this is my first time dipping into barnes s carlotta carlyle series and i can t say i was in any way impressed this novel is both underwritten and clumsy full of cliches poorly drawn characters false tension silly narrative developments and ultimately a revelation that makes absolutely no sense i don t believe in putting spoilers in these reviews so i won t describe the utterly absurd revelations that come at the end of this novel but suffice to say that to call it half baked would be to insult all the half baked books out there i am glad barnes s many fans find enjoyment in her works and i hope they can continue to do so but for a reader who is looking for something other than a lifeless installment in a feisty female detective series do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 
sloppy i think better information can be gained by reading wikipedia than can be gained from reading this book as a metalhead i have the feeling that moynihan is an outsider writing about something he doesn t really understand maybe he is just catering to people who aren t familiar with metal but it s to the detriment of the book s accuracy i think he misses the point of some bands he also does a very quick and sloppy job of some sections which is annoying for example he states the misfits mutated into samhain by the band had changed names again to simply danzig which is totally false the misfits ended when glenn danzig left the band and formed samhain which later became danzig furthermore the misfits reunited without danzig in meaning that danzig and the misfits existed as separate bands at the time of the book s printing it s one of many sloppy errors hasty summaries in the book that make it frustrating to read if you are a fan or already know the story this book will be nothing but agravation if you are an outsider to the genre it should be an interesting read 
franken is a failure al franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything this book is his attempt to take on radio giant rush limbaugh all i can say is it is a good thing mr franken used rush s name on the title otherwise this book would have been like every other franken project an abject failure if you are easily entertained by shrill and hysterical name calling this book is for you i found it sophmoric and superficial pretty much like al 
misrepresented this book was not written by hayek it was written by editor and confidant w w bartley when hayek was sick and incapacitated the only parts written by hayek were just random notes that only show up in the appendices 
poor execution national geographic magazine is famous for their excellent photography it is the very reason i picked up this volume however wide angle national geographic greatest places failed to live up to my expectations i was underwhelmed not only by a large portion of the images but mostly by the poorly executed concept in a title that clearly implies these are the greatest places featured i felt the chosen photographs illustrated some lackluster locales furthermore the organization was too loose the book could have benefited from better formating not only of its categories but of the photos themselves which are often stretched in an unflattering matter 
susan is no ann coulter why would anyone spend money for this book it is just more whining susan needs to get her own material and stop trying to be an imitation of someone else isn t susan happy in her own skin and with her own looks ann has the facts on her side susan represents the party that is quite happy taking scissors and sticking them in the back of the neck of a partially born baby whom they want to kill need i say more about who is soulless and godless don t waste your time and money with this book 
breaking news superpowers are not real i haven t done this in awhile but i don t think i could review this piece any better than the other reviews i ve read about it it s pretty average however filled with nice bits of knowledge they didn t seem well researched in some areas here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other critics that i agree with they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences would be enough john gallant biased against superheros sic christopher ritter i found this book to be tedious lacking in charm badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas c p halliday i picked up this book lawrance m bernabo their belief seems to be that donald duck was the best comic book ever m g bloedorn pretty boring bernardz a black hole is hypothesized lending a faint respectability to the premise behind green lantern s abilities peter vinton jr this book will not satisfy full on fans james n simpson ltgave it five stars a chance to laugh about the heroes i still love and that mean so much to me reviewer man there s a whole pages of this pooh poohing cranky oldmaid kind of stuff mark alfred they were even putting words into c darwin s mouth aaron spriggs mildly entertaining but not great reviewer when the man dean koontz in this case writing the introduction says he doesn t read comics i began to get worried ivan a wolfe i agree with an earlier poster reviewer almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible plastic larry the authors give us a more plausible given what we know now origin for the hulk involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification j draper carlson this book is not mean spirited or nasty reviewer supermans powers break the laws of science ooh stop the presses interesting rick hunter the science of superheroes reviewer 
she s supposed to be a bright cop but she does dumb things just to make the plot work not very realistic if you want a realist cop character try michael connelly s harry bosch 
this book is a shameful attempt to ignore the real causes of election fraud this book is nothing but a shameful and disguised attempt notwithstanding his denials to discredit democratic voters and to advocate the enactment of election reform laws that will disenfranchise voters while at the same time ignore and dismiss the greatest threat to our democracy today the privatization of our elections with corporate owned electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software and leave no paper trail for auditing them to be more specific the book is filled with purported examples of illegal voters ignoring the fact that this problem accounts for a small minority of election fraud in our country today to remedy this problem fund advocates several measures that will do little to remedy the problem while disenfranchising millions of voters mostly those who are poor or non white and most likely to vote democratic here are just three examples among the many cited in funds book disallowing homeless people to vote because they don t have a proper address requiring a picture id to vote which of the population lack and which amounts to a poll tax for the poor abolishing the extending of voting hours in situations where insufficient allocation of voting machines results in as long as hour waits to vote again this is a problem faced mainly in poor and minority neighborhoods but whereas fund is so concerned that an occasional illegal voter may slip through the cracks in our system when it comes to electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software although admitting that mistakes are sometimes made he claims that these machines cannot be used to steal elections to prove this point he does nothing more than quote a man who works as a pr consultant for diebold although fund is careful not to mention this fact 
terrible book this book is full of errors and the subject matter presentation is far from an introduction i used this in an intro class and it was one of the most useless textbooks i have ever bought if it is a required book do yourself a favor and buy some additional reading material 
narcissistic twaddle all i could think was damn if i had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge i d never be depressed i don t know quite how to explain it but i felt no empathy for him i only ended up feeling more depressed as a history of depression the level of research was quite impressive if you read prozac nation and wanted to punch her out steer clear of this one as well 
disappointing i had high hopes for this volume but like many other reviewers i was dimayed by the author s profound ignorance or economics and even more profound ignorance of history he has the british left s rabid hatred of maggie thatcher and consequently he is blind to the tremendous economic resurgence of great britain under her leadership similarly his analysis of fiscal policies under reagan consists mainly of reciting old charges of voodoo economics and so he blames tax cuts for deficits instead of actually looking at the record and discovering that us tax receipts actually increased after the tax reform the remainder of the book consists in large part of assorted bits of nonsense found in government and academia most of it of little consequence there are some gems buried in their as well but the bulk of the book is so taken with the author s personal predjudices and ignorance that i can t recommend it 
don t waste your time i thought this book would give a better insight into the world of the ha but i came away disappointed quesnel s story is interesting and controversial but i don t think his story reveals enough details 
scatter brain ranting at it finest i honestly admit i did not finish this book the topics jump from one to the next with no focus the author reminded me of my worst profs in college a self proclaimed genius with no ability to write or communicate 
reverse racism is not the answer referring to nice white people as demons who are just trying to hold the black man down is not an answer to racism akil is a hypocrite because he is just as racist as the people he is accusing of being racist stereotyping all white people as being oppressive to other races because white people don t want to see african americans succeed is ludicrous akil writes with hatred towards white people and blames white people for all of his shortcomings his message is a horrible one to expose to young influential adolescents because he is passing on a message of hate he gives the impression that a black person not accomplishing his her goals occurs only because white people will not allow black people to succeed maybe he should try passing along the message that people need to be responsible for their actions and any person that genuinely strives to accomplish a goal can accomplish it also he writes on the back cover of his book that learning to read challenging material such as work by shakespeare is a waste of time this is the exact opposite of what he claims his goal is educating young people of all races is an equalizer if akil had studied more shakespeare then maybe his book wouldn t be riddled with grammatical errors 
incredibly biased the china threat references president clinton always in a negative manner almost as much as china despite this edition having been written after president bush took office and in some instances his adding to the issues that gertz was upset with clinton about further there was little no negative reference to presidents nixon reagan or bush i either for similar actions eg building trade thus my conclusion that the book is incredibly biased true china has exercised incredible brutality against its people in the past chairman mao was responsible for the death of millions see jung chang s book for details however the situation has since greatly improved and deserves rethinking gertzs recommendation that the u s increase pressure on china for democratization rings hollow given the degree of gerrymandering and influence buying in congress and deliberate law breaking and lying by this administration gertz also brings up china s support for north korea s missile manufacturing forgetting u s support for india s ignoring nuclear non proliferation pacts chinese monies given to the democratic party ignoring u s funds given to various candidates in former russian territories and other locations and alleged chinese spying on u s atomic secrets ignoring u s spy plane flights along china s border u flights over china satellite photography across china and efforts to obtain information on china s nuclear programs and then there s china s large military outlays one eighteenth that of the u sgertz however missed the greatest threats from china economic our large and rapidly growing trade deficit over billion in manufacturing job losses and major borrowings of u s debt about billion second only to japan put the u s at serious economic risk not worth reading 
a conflicted review my review of this book is somewhat conflicted while i would state it would make a good book if you did not know anything about windows security i find that it fails as a preparation for the exam i read some of the paragraph length sentences to others at work and they too got a chuckle out of it the simplest of items are presented in a wordiness that would make reading our mutual friend or even war and peace akin to glancing through the sunday comics at the same time many items that should be the meat of the book are glossed over in an almost trivial manner if this were simply a training manual it would have received or even stars while windows nt server can be considered archaic not even a full page in this text is given to security concerns during the upgrade procedure from nt to i would heartily suggest brushing up on upgrade issues for the exam if this book is to be your sole study guide with only questions on the exam it would not take many nt questions to blow your chance at passing the exam 
way too complicated this is a good book for serious health nuts that have the time and energy to make simple easy recipes with a million strange ingredients that you ve probably never heard of if you plan on making lots of baby food with kelp and sea weed then this is the book for you 
unreadable this is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book this book in my opinion is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders a complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance take time researching this book before you buy it because it s the worst book i ve ever purchased 
freud must perish i was hoping to gain insight into the repercussions of incest i couldn t get past the beginning of the book as it was filled with freudian pseudoscience perhaps another revision is in order 
some of this author s advice is damaging i enjoyed this author s other outsmarting book better the one not about menopause this book comes across as whiney at times with a woeisme approach to midlife despite her efforts to appear positive she condones eating things like french fries potato chips full fat products daily chocolate and has a minimum necessary approach to fitness she clearly isn t a fitness fanatic she even mentions that larger women can have a commanding presence and lists aretha franklin as an example ! hello that woman epitomizes over indulgence also if you are very active you will have to get more food into you than she says i tried to only eat the smallest meals only when i was hungry and probably because i am fit and exercise regularly i needed quite a few more calories than she suggested i suggest women look to a life full of activity as an antidote to depression and aging and i would not suggest as the author does that the fat we need in our diet come from junk foods like potato chips there are so many more ways to get fat into your diet that don t involve saturated fats avoiding bad foods does not qualify as a diet it s good sense 
short changed i was excited when i saw this book at my local book store and after flipping throught it made an immediate decision to purchase i wish now i had looked at it a little longer before buying there are parts of this book that i just loved and parts that i hated because they were not there while i feel that this has the potential to be a wonderful reference overall i feel short changed because of the sections missing which dealt with some important bikes this is in spite of the advertising on the back cover which clearly states that it contains information on every american motorcycle made in the relevent time frame for example this book divides the excelsior chapter into two parts it covers excelsior from to and states on the bottom of page that the super x is treated as a seperate marque later in the book well it s not there the page section they did on the big excelsior is wonderful but excelsior s super x is nowhere to be found i felt cheated if they had done half as good covering the superx as they had done with the earlier excelsiors i would have been very happy also missing is the section covering the yale motorcyle page says yale data are contained within the yale section well once again there is no yale section overall an important work fatally flawed by omissions 
could have been better i think well the fact that i m writing a review about this book while it s sitting open on my desk next to my computer open and not being read might be some evidence of how i m enjoying this book this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn t be so difficult this book is not clear or easy to understand at all every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page making this work look like a research project for a phd publication i have the casebook in this series and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity and it turns to be true ! this book might be good if you re advanted contracts and want to know every little detail or as an advanced reference later on to look something up like in an encyclopedia some concepts which should be pretty clear just get too in depth coverage in this book it s too complex for a first year student sometimes it starts describing the different views out there and then there s a jumble in your head as to what the law really is i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors 
silly premise this is one of kellerman s poorest books when you finally get to what is going on it is ridiculous don t waste your time on this 
pete you still don t get it don t read this book i wish i hadn t it ruined pete rose in my eyes not because of what others have said about him but because of what rose said about himself my grandpa was a huge fan of pete rose and once took me to meet him at riverfront stadium when i was around six about the only thing i m glad for with this book is it didn t come out in my grandpa s lifetime we all make mistakes we re only human and that s what humans do we screw up sometimes badly i wish pete rose was in the hall of fame i wish he was coaching the reds today i wish most of all he d never placed a single bet on baseball but as for pete like i said up there he still doesn t get it and i doubt he ever will this book was a disappointment for many reasons it did give me a nice look at pete s career with the cincinati reds and took me back to my grandfather s tales of how great the big red machine of the s was but what was lacking in these pages was contrition and i think that was supposed to be what this book was about the pete rose i met in my prison without bars was a likable fellow but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative this is somebody else s fault attitude that put me off and i m sure put a lot of others off too rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the s a fact that surprised virtually no one but instead of presenting an apology or even a straightforward confession rose comes across as a bitter man still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing he blames everyone from his friends and business associates to major league baseball for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa charlie hustle the greatest baseball player of his era left me feeling negative toward him and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook those were not images i had of the man before i started this book and i m sorry that s how i felt when i was done if i could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work i d tell him pete you ve led an interesting sixty plus years you re one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field you deserve to be in cooperstown but your attempt to make amends with this book probably your last chance sadly is a dismal failure and a backset i remember well the night you passed ty cobb s all time hitting record i read this mostly to acquaint myself with a player about whom i heard so much growing up i now wish i didn t know ths of what i now do know about you as i said starting out don t read this book 
for long time readers only another enjoyable read quicker than most because you don t have to think it s not much of a mystery and the siamese cats really have little to do with its solution but provide a clever title mostly they give braun a chance to ooh and ahh over the inexplicable ways of cats it was many books ago that koko actually provided a useful clue to his host mr q the genial bachelor billionaire who is every tame girl s wish mostly this is a tale from moose county miles north of anywhere if you don t know what i m talking about this is certainly not right place for you to pick up this series brrr is celebrating its th anniversary with scots a giant cake bland good will from everyone and qwilleran s second historical disaster radio show up on stage that s pretty exciting too when we get to hear the whole script oh sure there s a bad happening or two in town but don t let that put you off for they occur well out of view there s also good times with q s good friends and a subplot about an old lady her fabulous antiques and her mercenary granddaughter there s no significant development in the relationships among any of braun s stock characters you know who i mean to top off a pleasantly fluffy read braun appends two of q s favorite delicious recipes a quintessential summer beach read guaranteed to pass a few hours pleasantly 
needs a companion book while this is a good quick reference guide i have found that i have needed another book for most things this would probably be good for kids as long as parents have another source for more detailed reference 
not worth the read or the money this is really an unfortunate book it reminds one of those town hall events that the white house orchestrated for the foolish stops in days tour during which president bush tried to sell his social security reform plan to the american public like those events this book is shallow and polemical altman divides the history of social security policy makers into the good those who would never think to question or challenge any aspect of the program and the bad those who either oppose the program or so much as question any aspect of it she devotes not a single chapter no not even so much as a page or a sentence to a cricital examination of her own preconceptions or to any attempt to understand in a thoughtful manner the positions of those who have critically examined various aspects of the program over the years this book is a catechism for altman and the like minded there is no serious analysis anywhere within these pages for many of us who do not favor individual accounts but who worry about the long term solvency of the program this book really is a disappointment i recommend diamond and orszag s saving social security instead for those interested in a detached scholarly account of social security s early years i recommend achenbaum s social security visions and revisions for those who just want a thoughtful analysis of the issues at play in the current policy debate over social security perhaps the best of all is daniel shaviro s making sense of social security reform anything but altman s book 
a total waste of money this book is a waste of money for whomever buys it a waste of paper totally useless and offers absolutely no useful info beyond what any reasonable person does not know the writer merely lives on a parked boat and might as well live in a cramped apartment from where he can write the same worthless stuff there are no essentials in the book believe me go spend your money somewhere else dutch west 
important story poor book i give james bradley much credit for making this important though unpalatable story better known we need to realize that as human beings americans are not significantly better or worse than most others especially when tested by the extremes of war however bradley s basic writing skills as evidenced in this book are not appropriate to an important historical volume he jumps back and forth between between ordinary colloquialisms and formal historical style he uses the first names of historical figures curtis for lemay some of his descriptions of firestorm effects are much overdrawn and unrealistic there are internal contradictions he frequently uses sarcasm which is completely inappropriate for a serious work of history it is most unfortunate that his poor writing has much diminished the contribution that this book could have made further a great annoyance is the word flyboys i lived through wwii and my older brothers were in the pacific theater throughout one was a naval air crewman who flew many missions over japan in those days i do not recall ever hearing the word flyboys used to describe any of our own or the enemy s air personnel i find the word sarcastic and derogatory 
leonard how could you i can t believe leonard maltin would put his name on this compilation of misinformation he must be spreading himself too thin and hiring interns to do his writing this book is so full of wrong dates films facts i hope if he comes out with a second edition maltin hires someone to go over it with a fine toothed comb and make corrections i expected better of him 
very disappointing not a good arthurian retelling at all i haven t read king arthur and his knights of the round table since i was in high school but i have become fascinated with the retelling of the arthurian tale written by various authors i picked up guenevere queen of the summer country because someone had recommended the book as one of the best retelling tales centered on the legend of king arthur bah ! this uninspired uninteresting novel has left a bitter taste in my mouth in this retelling queen guenevere lives in the summer country where women rule and take on various lovers other than her husband marrying king arthur a christian instead of a pagan means trouble and destruction in camelot especially after she meets sir lancelot guenevere and arthur try to create a more peaceful environment for all faiths in camelot but there are people who will not allow it like merlin and arthur s sisters namely morgan le fay the aforementioned synopsis is similar to the original tale which means that not much has been added in this version the only difference between this book and the original arthurian tale is the manner the story is told is quite insipid to me rosalind miles tries to write the tale from a feminist s point of view making guenevere a woman with power in her own right and someone who tries to avoid the overtake of christianity in camelot but neither her story nor arthur s is interesting to me not even merlin and morgan are fascinating enough to keep me riveted i forced myself to read this book in an effort to justify spending fifteen dollars on it i won t be giving the other two parts of this trilogy a whirl thank god i hadn t bought them ! i guess i ll have to look for a good king arthur retelling elsewhere i ve heard queen of camelot by nancy mckenzie is good i hope i ll have better luck with that one 
if you have a choice choose a different book i bought and used this book for a probability class and for preparation for the society of actuaries soa exam course i had never had a probability or statistics class and this book did a very poor job of helping me to understand the topics i had to resort to using other books not required for the class in order to understand anything i did not pass the the soa exam and i blame that in part on this stupid book i also had about class mates all of which had just as much disgust for the book as i did not disgust for the class but for the book 
really really not good i was really excited about this book i ve been studying islam for about ten years now and ride the cusp of converting so i thought this would be an excellent resource a christian convert to islam who has a b a and m div from harvard would seem to be a perfect read i was horribly disappointed the title claims this is an interfaith dialogue that s stretching the term a bit outer faith dialogue might be a better term for it it would seem to me that his information is as current as his mdiv degree which my guess would be dates back a far as the s it s as if he has merely rehashed that information much of which is quite outdated today heres his method take the gospels as we have them strip away their roots bring in the apocryphal literature as if they were concurrent with the gospels as we have them claim that there were many different groups fighting to represent the true gospel and make it seem as if the power mongers won out fine but his methodology is seriously flawed an example should suffice he dates the gospel of john to c e which is a pretty liberal date most scholars conservative or other date it prior to c e to between and c e take an apocryphal gospel such as treatise of shem dated between the second and fourth centuries ce and claim that the earliest date is most probable with absolutely no support so late date the gospel of john claim it has been edited the most take treatise of shem and date it to the second century perhaps c e and what he s done is presented the gospel of john and treatise of shem as two gospels circulating at the same time ! bunk other fringe ideas the jesus we all know and love was not from galilee the jesus pursued in the new testament was a member of the galilean part of paramiliatry insurrectionsts this is the jesus that was arrested when peter denies jesus three times he is denying this jesus not the jesus we think at the trial then barabbas whose real name is jesus bar abbas ie son of the father i e our jesus is released jesus the aforementioned insurrectionist is crucified thus confirming the claims of the qur an that jesus was not crucified ! how bout that though he does not claim this is actually what happened he tosses it in there as a hypothesis he s really working it to make early christianity fit in the islamic scheme the book is quite honestly a dismissal of and insult to traditional christianity and introduces the other christianities as being the more in line with the true christianity ie islam that s fine but the title and intent is flawed at best misleading at worst i felt as if i was reading the da vinci code all over again some of his sources are from the more fringe side of christian scholarship such as helmut koester from harvard no surprise there members of the jesus seminar even drawing from isaac asimov the vast majority of his sources are dated prior to nothing wrong with fringe scholarship don t get me wrong see some of my other reviews but he merely gathered information from high and low and everywhere in between in order to back his claims it lacks consistency its really not well thought out at all and actually does a disservice to islam as well as someone looking through these apocryphal gospels could simply make the case that islam borrowed directly from them the other problem is that the very same gospel he claims has been edited the most john is the very same gospel that claims to be prophesying that the advocate was really muhammad the only value in the book is that it does present what is standard polemic in many muslim circles overall a tremendously disappointing book for a better in depth discussion from westerners who have converted to islam try muhammad asad murad hoffman and or martin lings 
a book for a princess i ordered this book because my husband who owns his own remodeling company never gets around to fixing anything in our home go figure i was disapointed because it seems most of this book refers to is for people who have zero knowledge how to look at a circuit breaker come on if you don t know that then you don t need to attempt any of these things in this book it did include some basic wiring which i was glad for i would definitely save your money however find something not so dummy oriented if you already know the basics 
un inspired attempt this is an un successful follow up to culture matters cases are generally boring and attempt to answer the how culture matters failed we will have to wait for a better try 
too much aimless wandering i stopped reading after pages there are three interwoven tales the first of a serial murderer who wanders around trying to evade a supernatural monster and his half crazy ex wife who seems to get off on the prospect of being killed the second of a high tech pirate ship that wanders around kills a few people tries to find out something about a mysterious device the third about two men who only seem to wander around aimlessly and the prose which initially felt interesting seems to wander around aimlessly too a pity since a nice sf world shines through 
a complete time waster to appreciate bill porter s life and success it is far better to see him portrayed in the movie door to door featuring william h macy shelly brady s book completely misses the mark i found it to be a little too self serving syrupy and terribly redundant at times it read like the bill porter story starring shelly brady 
lost faith in seth godin as a marketing guru after this book godin wrote about the new way of customer and prospect communication in permission marketing a must read he then got bold and told us about differentiation by creating something completely out oftheordinary such as a purple cow agreeable airplane literature now there s really nothing else to talk about and he tries to push the envelope talking about how cracker jack s prize is the product your product s soul is not only about the extras i would have preferred he kept to his excellent job in permission marketing and not losing his focus as he did in free prize inside i am not going to read a th godin book 
neopaganism nonsense this book is anything but a source of information on real magick bonewits whose name is appropriate claims to be a druid and a wiccan although wicca has taken a lot from druidism they are not the same and you can t be both mr bonewits is nothing more than a hippie yuppie environmentalist ie a college puke who like nicholls and gar gomm invented neo paganism as a new movement just to put themselves at the forefront of it if you go to this mans website you will see that he will do or say or sell anything to make a buck beware true druids will know this to be true 
disappointing to say the least the pursuit is a sequel to johanna lindsey s wonderful love story love me forever in this book lachlan and kimberly s daughter melissa is and has unknowingly fallen in love with an enemy of her clansmen lincoln ross burnett due to a childhood misunderstanding melissa s uncles are determined that she will not marry linc they go to any extremes to keep them apart including having him shanghaied on a ship bound for china this is far and away one of the most annoying and useless johanna lindsey books i ve ever read i normally love her books and love me forever was one of my favorites which makes it even harder to put up with such a sad showing from one of my favorite authors the plot was hard to take throughout with the characters fierce resistance to letting the past stay in the past furthermore it s a ridiculous and overblown idea to even suggest that two people could fall in love after a minute conversation and so deeply in fact that one was willing to defy her entire family for it if you read this novel please don t believe that it is characteristic of lindsey s writing style pick up love me forever or prisoner of my desire for a much better showing from this usually very talented author of romantic fiction 
not worth the paper it s written on i read the book came to this site to write a review and was flabbergasted by the people that wrote positive reviews had they never encountered dietary information before was this their first knowledge of how food is processed in the body and what foods one should eat even if that were the case there are still better guides available i found this book to be a cheap attempt to earn a little money at the expense of people wanting serious nutritional information maybe the positive reviews really were written by friends or by the author s own public relations firm which advocates napping induced by reading his own book no doubt 
the bell curve in new clothes empirical lies and logical fallacies included i jotted down more than words of notes on just the first pages of this book so egregious are its wrongs that includes lies told from within his own scientific field of expertise by anthropologist vincent sarich an example on page sarich claims that the out ofafrica hypothesis of modern homo sapiens dates that to about bce this is not incontrovertible to the point anthropology shows modern homo sapiens outside africa long before that date and even if bce is taken as the point for some final breakout beyond africa and the neighboring edge of the middle east sarich s idea deliberately glosses over backwash migration back into africa primarily from neighboring parts of the middle east but also from elsewhere witness the colonization of madagascar by people from south india in the last few thousand years besides how can sarich fit those smart as a whip jews living oh so close to darkest africa into this hypothesis more seriously the jebel qafzeh skull from israel is the most commonly known candidate for the oldest modern homo sapiens skull ever found it dates to between years of age on page the authors misinterpret a lincoln quote about the difference between races and infer that rather than talking about the sociologocial fallouts from a clearly perceived difference in skin colors lincoln was talking about deeper differences in physical attributes the last paragraph of page has a logically fallacious appeal to authority which the authors continue throughout the first chapter of the book at the bottom of page the authors appear to make a logically and empirically unwarranted jump from all humans distinguishing other humans and classifying chunking them into certain groups to an almost platonic ideal concept called race page going with their unproven and logically fallacious idea generating year date for the evolution of modern homo sapiens miele and sarich then use this to bootstrap their own arguments about the degree of difference between races claiming this shows how rapidly human evolution can progress it s clear circular reasoning based on an already assumed point of view pages have a laughably racist genetic rather than sociological assumption of evidence for various types of athletic prowess i await every new world class african swimmer or hockey player to refute athetics of the gaps thoughts like this more seriously here s a sociological counterexample chinese children and adults are known from research to have an above average percentage of musical perfect pitch genes and the piece de resistance on page the mean sub saharan african iq of all together now can we say bell curve how ironic that coauthor miele is a senior editor of skeptic magazine because this book warrants incredible amounts of skepticism 
gregory has done better i couldn t tell you who this book was about but it certainly wasn t elizabeth i portrayed by gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship and the writing isn t so hot either if i had to read one more time that elizabeth was picking her cuticles i would have gone mad the other boleyn girl is a much better effort 
some good points it is a book with some good poems girl in a library for example is fine mazur has issues though that get a bit too personal with the girl in the library she fears for her ability to love in the future there are also issues with her mother it is a fine book with some fine writing but a bit too autobiographical 
a definite bonk i am not often motivated to rate books but this one annoyed me it is dull repetitive disorganized and discouraging as another reviewer noted i guess i just didn t get the joke don t buy it unless you want to be bored and depressed 
terrible worst book i ve read this book was terrible and i would not recommend it for anyone especially young teens although i do understand the author s intentions the grammar and punctuation were incorrect issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly overall the story was very unrealistic i had to make myself finish reading it despite wanting to quit many times it was not exciting and didn t keep my interest not recommended at all 
overblown claims from cassandra doomsayers are nothing new in the late th and early th centuries when jewish populations were growing rapidly in many parts of europe anti semitic politicians and demagogues leaped to the fore and claimed that jews were a fundamental threat to society jews stole jobs polluted and corrupted society destroyed culture and were responsible for crime i see a similar fear now re occuring except now it is for muslims muslims as a fairly conspicuous minority make easy targets for europeans to blame their complex problems however while europe does face some real difficulties in economic demographic and social terms including with integrating minorities the notion of a collapse of europe into something like afghanistan or iran or pakistan or saudi arabia is nonsense while islamic radicalism and terrorism are real and dangerous threats as the recent mi report indicates terrorists and terrorist threats come from only a small fraction of the muslim population problems with economic integration stem not just from religion but also from issues related to racial discrimination as well as things like inflexible labour laws which the french have refused to reform when it comes to problems like demographic decline or economic stagnation the europeans have only themselves to blame and need to adopt a more entrepenurial spirit they also need to recognise the need to allow people to openly practice religious faith lest dangerous pseudo ideaologies fill the void however muslims only form around of the population in france and of less in the uk the fear of being bred out is an illusion and in any case many non muslim migrants are arriving in europe each year from places like romania and poland will the uk become polish and romanian in two or three decades free borders are important in a globalised world and history has generally shown isolationism and protectionism do not work to build rule of law democracy and prosperity demonising muslims and other minorities is a dangerous way of trying to get out of dealing with complex issues which europe has to do if it wants to compete with india and china and the us muslims need to be seen as assets rather than threats to society and while muslim community leaders have an obligation to stamp out terrorism and radicalism and ensure proper integration europeans have an obligation not to repeat the ugly past in their treatment of minorities 
tough read for those new to the subject this book was first published at the beginning of the century and the expected audience was educated englishman this means that trevelyan assumes the reader is already very familiar with not only the general outline of the history but also of the individuals and the roles they play for example to criticize james i he says he deliberately chose carr and villiers if you nodded knowingly then you ll probably enjoy the book but most americans unless they have a strong interest in the stuart monarchy probably say carr villiers who the heck are they be prepared to say that frequently and to read at least pages often more before the casually thrown out reference is finally explained if you remember it by the time you get there in addition his writing style nears the heights or depths of victorian impenetrability be prepared to reread a sentence a couple of times just to figure out what the subject and verb are and what phrase modifies which noun i m not usually put off by difficult language but this book went a little too far in that direction even for an individual who reads dickens and donne for fun finally the author s prejudices and opinions are in full display this book was written before the expectation that an author should remain neutral or at least not overtly biased was firmly entrenched in my opinion this actually adds to the interest of the book rather than detracts from it but the reader should keep in mind that the opinions expressed are strictly those of the author and not the unanimous verdict of history if you extremely interested in the time of the stuarts then you will probably find this book fascinating in its presentation of the historical judgement of years ago if you are not already well informed on the subject and not a fan of complex language where plain would do then you ll be better off looking elsewhere 
tell me something i didn t know this book may be somethat interesting for polisci majors when they are first starting out but once a person has their degree and their resume it is not worth the time to read it 
stars for this one probably the most over hyped book i ve ever read no spoilerswhere to start this could easily turn into a long review but i don t want it to be so i ll try to keep it short also i ll stay away from the religious views regarding this book and focus on the writing because religion is subjective and everyone can and should think whatever they want about their religion having said that the one recurring thought i had about this book while reading it and while thinking about it after completing it for this review was that it is without a doubt the most esoteric and pedantic book i have ever read now i m not stupid and i can appreciate the beauty of words and the importance of diction but so much of this book was rushdie writing in such a way to make sure that you had no idea what the hell he was talking about there are times when you can be extremely metaphorical and lofty and times when you should just be blunt but for rushdie there is no bluntness and everything must be doused in the most stringy and free formed words he can think of why in some cases it adds to the story in this it doesn t while there are some very good parts in this book they are all surrounded by a lot of words that don t really say anything bottom line you can skip this book however those interested in religion and questioning said relgion will probably read it anyway i would suggest you get a durable copy because you will want to throw it against the wall a few times ps the best part of the whole book for me was towards the end in the scenes between saladin and his father if the whole book had been written like that it would ve been a pleasure 
hard to swallow i tried to read this book but only made it about pages despite the many rave reviews and status of this book it did not ring true to me i read it while vacationing in the galapagos and i just didn t buy it i love the genre krakauer being number one in the heart of the sea etc all good but this one did not work for me sorry 
feeble heart rate training this book tries to do too much it wants to be a heart rate training book and a book about training for sporting events the book is only pages get the picture the book provides cursory information on training for various sports walking running cycling in line skating and triathlon obviously if you really wanted to learn how to train competitively for these sports this isn t the book for you if you re looking for a book that tells you how to create a workout you can do at a health club on a stair climbing machine or elliptical trainer etc this is not the book for you sure there s a chapter on group exercise ie aerobic class but it far from practical the introductory chapters merely delineate the heart zones rather than offering suggestions for combining them meaningfully or providing progressive programs the book simply tries to cover too much in order to increase its market 
from the same minds that brought you joel osteen i purchased eldredge s wild at heart and i didn t think it was scripturally sound i was given waking the dead as a present so i tried to read it as well i finally gave it up john eldredge s writing is typical of today s movement to bring the world into the church trying to show a young christian the religious aspects of movies like the matrix may work but to my year old ears it rings very hollow perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute christ s message to get people to listen for better or worse i have little patience for it the author also presents the image of god as my friend to me this is nothing but another watering down of the gospel message to get the world to accept it giving the creator human attributes brings him down to a level where we can work things out between us i can t find that kind of relationship in any legitimate bible translation after all my friend wouldn t let my saintly mother die and save a worthless drug addict now would he god my friend probably wouldn t have sent his son to die for my worthless self anyway this is exactly the same theology as building the largest christian church in the united states and not putting any crosses in it so as not to offend anyone it s the same as getting on a nationally televised program and stuttering about whether you believe those who don t accept christ are doomed to hell when you profess to be a christian minister or author and you can t speak correctly of what christianity teaches it s time to examine just what you really believe god s word is not always easy to swallow either it s the truth or it isn tmr eldredge also speaks often of setting hearts free while i do believe hearts are free when released from sin a christian is bought and paid for with christ s blood and not free at all titus kj begins paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ christians are freed but to begin a life of service for a more accurate and fulfilling study i recommend the way of the master books and videos by ray comfort kirk cameron 
hogwash i saw the author this morning on good morning america and i couldn t disagree with him more he said that cardio workout s did not burn alot of calories that is not true as it burns much more than lifting weights orerall ! also walking is considered weight bearing it is good for so many things including depression memory and circulation they even say it can reduce the incidence of breast cancer and other cancers not to mention that it is great for your heart nothing could be healthier to do it is true that when you lift weight you will burn more calories at rest but it is not that much it is actually really low something like or calories a day it is good to do both and don t forget streching as far as weight goes it is true it is just calories that cause to gain or lose he was right about that but if i ate calories a day i would starve i workout alot on the treadmill and i am not overweight it does not increase my appetite it just makes me feel really good dont waste your money and buy this book 
worst humorous book this is a worst book i ever read also it is not written by jerry seinfeld but forwarded by him and i picked it up because of seinfelds name this book lacks humor its no way at the level of larry davids or costanzas character the chapters are just repetetive crappy letters and stories can be very humorous but that humour is completely lacking in this book i am giving it a star because that is the lowest i can go avoid this it is a waste of time broth must try a bit hard for his next publication seinfeld shows that he can be a loyal friend by giving a forward to this book i guess without reading it 
racist misogynist and dated these writings seem quaint and offensive by today s standards these are wholly disappointing stories from a mediocre writer like a second rate steinbeck cooper seems completely in love with his meal ticket but i doubt this collection will draw any new admirers 
wish i had not bought it great concept timely topic wrong author she is whiny thoughout the book she buys an elephant lawn ornament but only pays to go the art museum this book needs to be written by someone else and then she needs to read it 
big on marketing short on details i have over year of woodworking experience building tables chests etc i bought this book as it sounded like everything i ever needed to know about box making the book was a big disappointment it has lots of colorful pictures on nice glossy thick paper but lacks the detailed instructions of how to build a box normally the taunton press fine woodworking magazine has excellent articles but this book falls short of giving you the know how to build a box 
lecture bomb ed generally i wouldn t review a book i didn t finish i only got about halfway through this snoozer still i tasted the food and it was bland please skip this stinker there are no new ideas or theories in this book not to mention the theories espoused are wrong lack of food is not caused by the catholic church and family planning it s caused by political systems and lack of freedom period and although i totally support helping the malnourished i do not support making room in our own budget to support other countries we already give enough welfare to many countries who don t need it or who just hoard it for themselves and freeze out the truly needy the author basically lectures and gives the reader what he feels is the truth and avoids presenting the facts and letter someone make their own mind up my favorite quote is from page of my text virtually all populations contain very many different genetic types for reasons that need not concern us and some are always outreproducing others pass this book on 
not top quality this item was worn on the edges and didnt live up to what was promiced but you get what you pay for 
i do not respect this author these guys are douches the author insinuates a lot of nasty stuff about peope i m close to which was utter malarkey considering that none of these people would talk to him so yeah that s all i have to say rudy giuliani whatever i don t know about all that and i m sure he s a douche too but i know sometimes the authors read these reviews and so i just want you to know that some people perhaps not yourself have feelings and morals and that your conjectures of conspiracy are in some cases just a desire for drama ! anyway i just wanted to tell you thatyou have won the biggest douche in the universe award over ursula the giant douche and david blaine congratulations and i hope you feel bad 
truly awful i hated this book ! i usually love coulters work and her heroes but anthony was just revolting ! the rape the beating everything about the way he treated her including the whole i loved your mother you ll do as the next best thing just left me wishing that another character even edward would come save poor cassie from this monstrous man ! he just completely degraded her so what if he loved her move on get over it personally i see his actions as a deranged stalker not a man in love i disagree with all the other reviewers who state that we shouldn t apply modern values to historical romances hello if i want realism i ll read a history book this is supposed to be fiction ! if it was really accurate he probably would have no teeth and smell bad ! plus we as the readers should identify with the main characters cassie s decision to love the man who raped her just left me cold my kind of heroine would have fought and made him pay maybe castrated him after beating him thoroughly if you like romances stay away 
a rather boring translation of the great dreigroschenoper one has to know and understand the original german text of the dreigroschenoper to be really able to judge the quality of the english translations this one used among others by helen schneider on her album with weill songs has nothing of the sarcasms of the german lyrics better read the translation of marc blitzstein or the translation made by frank mcguinness in the early s 
disappointing i am sorry to say this book is a great disappointment compared to the other very good books in the series the author comes across as arrogant instead of informed the illustrations are not as useful as they could be not of much introductory help for the residents or deeper reference for those in practice pablo ros book ct and mri of abdomen is much better if you can find a copy 
it shows its age i have serious misgivings about the facts presented in this book the original french text was written in the s i was given this book as i am working on a masterwork on the cultural history of olives and olive oil in this respect she often jumps to the wrong conculsion and makes broad judgements that have been discounted by anthropology since the s for instance she lists oil stores in ancient babylonia as being olive oil we know from further scholership that this would have been sesame oil and that olive oil was a fuel and not a consumptive in that culture at the time this causes me to question the entire book this may be an interesting read but at least with respect to olives and olive oil there is much better out there 
deep downer janet taylor lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some pippi longstocking thrown in then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold sad version of reality that shocks and confounds the denouement involves mental illness neglect and orphaning for more on this kind of approach to youth literature check out welcome to lizard motel by barbara feinberg 
this book is horrible okay now for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it put this book away right now put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it laugh in a malicious tone because you haven t feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written this book ends with such a melancholy abruption that i thought i might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes this book is horrendous angry reader 
title certainly feels very silly and pathetic at this point bush is winning the war on terror who here is sufficiently blissfully ignorant to still believe that iraq has completely imploded even centcom has acknowledged that we are fast approaching chaos and total anarchy there bush s occupation there is effectively at an end as for afghanistan the military now admits that the taliban is making a major widespread resurgance and now controls much of the country our recent bid to push back at their growing offense ended in failure in fact we now only control the capital of kabul and that only tenuously of course bin laden still runs free laughing at those he killed on no the sad plain truth is that bush is not in any way shape or form winning the war on terror this book has simply become a pathetic relic of a bygone era useful only as an object of sarcastic mockery and derision bush like those who believed in him has become nothing more than a very sad joke 
lacks soul yawn another self help book this one is geared towards the would be business leaders of the future i had to read this for a graduate class and if it were not required reading i would have certainly quit reading it after the first few pages leading with soul is primarily a narrative tale that is the bulk of the book is a tale about a fictional business manager named steven camden and his spiritual awakening steven is feeling empty depressed etc so he goes to this wise women in the woods where he learns to find his soul and thus be the best leader and human he can be i know pretty lame huh at the end of every section bolman sums up what is happening to steve and what we can do to find our souls you have probably gleaned from the above description what kind of book leading with soul is that s right another annoying fluffy self help book that appears on the surface level to contain deep insights but is really lacking in sustenance it really made me laugh when the author mentioned that we are always looking to gurus and fads to tell us how to live our lives instead of looking inward and what pray tell is leading with soul does bolman really think that his book is any different from the rest of the annoying self help fads the suggestions in this book are nothing new you can gain the same insights from reading a book on organizational industrial psychology people like to see their work as meaningful and worthwhile to feel personally accountable for the consequences of their efforts and to get feedback that lets them know the results etcand for all this finding your soul business let me sum it up for you there should not be a disconnect between your home life and work life you should not check your soul at the door when going to work you should be your authentic self look inward for answers yaddy yaddy selftalk mumbo jumbo etc etc get it now you don t have to waste your time reading this book 
couldn t finish it oh my word i have only ever not been able to finish a book twice in my life and this was number the first few chapters were ok but when things really started cooking plot wise the writing style became well high schoolish i wanted to like it so i plowed ahead but half way through it i gave up the writing style is amateurish and clunky characters act in a melodramatically with no realism there are patches of good writing but these patches are quickly followed by a clunker or two i would hope that the sequel to this book improved but since i can t finish the first i won t be trying the second 
missing content this is a little fun thing to read but it provides too little content in my mind 
very muddy reveiw of global violence mr laqueur fails to adequately distinguish the different types of violence and prefers to lump them all together under the title of terrorism far be it for me to disagree with the likes of mr cannistraro but i feel it necessary to better classify terrorism as being carried out against individuals or groups not directly associated with the root cause or disagreement the author creates a muddy and very confusing dialog by placing nearly all violence save that carried out national governments as terrorism that said the new terrorism can provoke serious students to create and refine their own definitions of terrorism i can only recommend this book to those allready possesing a good grounding in global terrorism for it will require the ability to critically analyze what can legitimately be termed quotterrorismquot 
well written terribly researched this was the first book about ottoman history i ever read having now read litterally hundreds of books about the subject i re read kinross and have some comments kinross has an engaging style and this book may ignite an interest in ottoman history in readers but only for the early history of the empire which is clearly where kinross interests lie even then he doesn t seem to be able to distinguish between history and legend and a rich and dynamic history is reduced to an oriental soap opera his account of the decline is depressing reflective of victorian bigotry and bias and innaccurate and condescending to the point of being mildly insulting kinross uses no ottoman or turkish sources whatsoever but then he doesn t really use anything written later than the th c he brushes over the th c and subscribes to the th c british static view of imperial decay the ottomans just sat around declining and having things done to it in reality the th c is one of the most interesting periods of ottoman history wherin the empire was forced to respond to th impact of european capitalism and imperialism really dynamic and creative reform programs were instituted with the result that the ottomans at the turn of the th c were incalculably stronger than they were at the turn of the th the tanzimat is given short shrift as an insincere effort to please the powers and is portrayed as the idea of the british ambassador and the hamidiyan era is portrayed as a period of retrenchment fanaticism and decadence when in reality abdul hamid albeit with oppressively autocratic means enormously modernized the empire and created the school system that educated later reformers including ataturk kinross is totally ignorant of intellectual trends in the ottoman empire and their interplay with other muslim lands and the west if this is your first ottoman history book i would read it up until the death of suleyman and then drop it i am not aware of a more modern and accurate general survey of the same type that is not too dry and academic for the casual reader but i would highly recommend selim deringil s the well protected domains to get a feel of the self perception of the ottomans in the late th c 
disappointing i thought the book was quotoversoldquot in a way from reading the jacket it looked like the quotanswerquot to the berenger sauniere mystery to what on earth it was that turned this impoverished rural cure into a wealthy identity now yes i know we have the sacred geometry but it s unfinished where s the follow up on the trough near the grove of trees where s the follow up on just what may have actually happened at the focal point of that pentagram we don t see it while the anecdotes are interesting and tragi comic in some cases they almost appear out of place in some parts i felt like i was reading quotthe making of holy blood holy grail quotquot which i loved by the way 
doesn t hold up well to other historical mysteries thrillers after reading his dark materials the white mercedes and the broken bridge and enjoying them quite throughly i ventured forth into the deep unknown of ruby in the smoke expecting something equally well written insightful and entertaining what i found was below par to my standards first of all the character development was practically non existant i put down this book feeling that i didn t really know any of the characters at all sally lockhart is your average every day mary sue uncommonly pretty quiet strong independent and as flawless as the ruby that she is destined to find the emotions displayed at the death of her father are bland and un grounded and it s hard to believe that she has emotions at all at certain points of the story there are hints of romance that never follow through statements that are never really explained and mystery that is kind of unintriguing setting aside the flatness of the characters jim was the only one that i think i liked at all simply because he had some flicker of a personality there are many things that just don t go smoothly in my mind with this novel a girl wandering alone in england in the th century for one although she is rumored to be independent there really is no way that she could have been that independent given the context her strength is too faltering to really give credibility to the fact that she wanders the streets alone in her free time in an era where those sorts of actions were not even tolerated furthermore the plot is too formulatic it follows the hero motif to the t with absolutely no bells and whistles the heroine is perfect the companions are as following the charming one the mischevious boy the fiery maiden the kindly old man ms scarlet with the candlestick ok well you get the picture the villian is flat cookie cutter evil without the dimentions that pullman gave to his mrs coultier in his dark materials it s an ugly old woman that wants to kill little girls for fame and fortune i know that this book was meant to be a cliche but there could have been a little bit of development thrown in to make it well more fun the action is a little under described to make anything truly interesting it s a bit of tell notshow writing with a dryness that doesn t go down well enough and an ending that leaves you thinking is that really it who knows perhaps the other books in the series are more engaging than this one but the way ruby in the smoke reads theres really nothing encouraging me to go on with the series overhyped yes make room on the shelves for a better mystery this is something that reads better if you don t have to pay for it i m sure 
a waste of time don t waste your time this book is not about cooking it s more about existential angst that results from a dead end job even julia the real one living at the time when told about the project sneered at the idea the first half of the book is boring the second half less so but boring nonetheless i gave the book away 
a waste this book will not benefit anyone it is repetitive and lacking the necessary detail to truly plan and install a radiant floor heating system it s unfortunate that books like this are not screened before being made available to the unsuspecting public 
when used as a self study text when used as a self study text i found the book to be lacking a sufficient quantity of example problems solved in adequate detail to be truly helpful 
i would never recommend his biggest advice a rooming house for one good luck finding a house that has proper zoning for this politicians and neighborhoods hate these things not to mention the nightmare of the transient types you will attract also it s pretty dated as it still recommends buying rtc properties the rtc died out years ago after the aftermath of the s real estate and s ampl crash 
you won t need this one i just finished passing my a exams today and i must say that this book was definately not much help overall as a review perhaps it could be considered useful but only to someone who can spot the errors there have been several reviews already pointing some of these out but there are more dealing with file system types supported by which operating systems etc as another reviewer pointed out i think the cheat sheet is useless as a cram tool also the cd did not contain all of the materials listed in appendix a and the test engine interface was pretty cheesy with absolutely no graphics or picures i wouldn t recommend this one to anybody who is seriously studying to pass their a certification exams for my recommendation go get all inone a certification exam guide by michael meyers it s the only way to go 
not a useful book this book is really not useful the idea of thinking your way to happiness is interesting and imbues a connotation of a potentially introspective read unfortunately this book belies its title and focuses on not thinking instead it explains anything that makes you unhappy should be ignored and things that make you happy are ok materialism is bad but if shopping for expensive shoes is what makes you happy go for it ! the author describes how you shouldn t be unhappy if you don t have everything you want while in the same book detailing his extensive materialistic compilations of houses etc this book is shallow and basically tells you everything is all right just keep telling yourself everything is all right everything is all right it is a superficial way to seduce happiness for a minute in your life the question of happiness is one that has confounded philosophers and thinkers all humans for centuries and to think a quickly read page book could allow you eternal happiness by thinking as the author explains thinking is preposterous 
it was more about christine than erik the story was disjointed and lacked the title character he introduced so many characters that he did not have time to bring erik to life i was very disappointed but it was mercifully short 
antidotal history that morphs into an eta apologist tract for the first two thirds of this book is basically an antidotal cultural history of the basque the light style and treatment of the subject are engaging however slowly and by degrees the book spawns a naive eta apologist essay of sorts that smoothly threads its way through the continuing cultural discussions of the basque the author blames the victims of eta for the violence by implying that spain is bringing eta violence down on itself by insisting that total independence for the basque regions of spain is not negotiable and insisting eta renounce violence the author indulges in hand wringing and whining about anti terrorist spanish legislation that allows the authorities to hold a terrorist suspect ten days incommunicado without charges the book was written pre and pre and consequently the author s arguments come across as rather limp in view of current events he also believes that if spain negotiates or grants more autonomy that eta will simply disappear i can t tell whether the author is a dupe or just unbelievably naive since this book was written in spain has granted more autonomy and guess what eta hasn t gone anywhere and is still murdering people this author also talks about eta and the catalonia aspirations for more autonomy in the same breath gee i don t remember the catalans murdering people he also implies that the odd basques killed are somehow no more reprehensible than the spaniards murdered by eta if you follow his logic you arrive at moral equations like eta terrorist killed in a gunfight civilians killed with a car bomb he also adroitly avoids pesky topics like who exactly are the eta terrorists if they share the same aspiration as the catalans why did they plant a bomb in a supermarket in catalonia and kill catalan women and children what about eta internal violence eta has purged some of his own over the years why avoid that potentially interesting topic how is eta financed is it extortion you think why detail alleged police abuse of eta suspects and not the eta war tax why do successful basques in the basque provinces avoid any outward show of wealth they are afraid of being kidnapped for ransom or having their war tax increased that s why the author apparently didn t deign to talk to any of these people or any of the family members of basque entrepreneurs who were brutalized for not paying their war tax following a line of inquiry like this might force the author to examine inconvenient questions like what is eta s overall economic impact on the region with so many capable motivated and well educated workers is eta why international investors and companies avoid the basque provinces like the plague the author talks at length about the guggenheim in bilbo how it was paid for it s relative architectural value the local support it had etc without mentioning that eta tried to bomb it when it opened and shot and killed a policeman near the entrance how did this further the goals of eta no wonder no one in spain or anywhere else is crazy to visit it why talk about gal s mercenary nature and international component and not about eta s international operations and links like the seamy links with the ira and the old un rehabilitated gadaffii and what about the contract hit they did unsuccessfully for the sandinistas on eden pastora what about the huge eta arsenal that accidentally blew up in panama an eta operative there had acquired the largest arsenal in non governmental hands ever discovered according to press reports has the author nothing to say about the worldwide network of eta often using a basque restaurant as a front that funnels arms and money back to their compatriots in spain with an international organization and extensive infrastructure like this it seems to me like they are planning to hang around awhile and have no more intention of disappearing than al qaeda so what is the future of eta if you reach the wild conclusion that they may not just simply disappearin the unlikely event an independent basque country came about might eta try to install themselves in power by force the author admits they are marxist in nature and only a small minority of basques support their actions so it seems contrived that this topic is never broached these topics despite their interesting nature and many sides might make eta appear less noble and more like a greedy band of blood thirsty thugs so the author simply ignores them anyone who has even a cursory knowledge of eta knows that they are about as altruistic as the mafia the author takes great care in contorting his little history to hide this fact to me this is totally unacceptable reporting i will not buy another of his books 
a disappointment i m a fan of koontz but this book was a disappointment first of all it seems that not much happens molly the main character goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing it s too cutesy with children and dogs koontz please the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired for most of the book it would be a star book but the ending is too cheesy and religious what will he write next a left behind book 
golden buddha i normally enjoy the cussler books especially the dirk pitt stories this one however is especially contrived and very confusing there is virtually no character development so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult i felt like i was in the fog of war seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end will the real clive cussler please come back 
stupid stupid review of a woman hillary who has allowed women s rights to be lowered so much for chelsea and her future 
don t read this book if you want anything with depth the more i read this book the less i like it it s an entertaining enough read if you re not looking for anything even remotely deep and serious the characters are very shallow guenevere wavers between being a strong woman and a silly narrow minded twit mostly she s the silly twit who goes so ballistic at the mere mention of a christian that you halfway expect her head to start spinning around ala the exorcist oh and she has visions lots of visions doom and gloom visions that seem to be there just so she can put her hand to her breast and feel faint and filled with doom and foreboding often times this book seems to be more of a romance novel in disguise guenever loves arthur oh she loves him oh arthur oh my love oh my heart oh arthur arthur ! arthur meanwhile cries a lot he s always weeping over something or moping about merlin arthur is perhaps the most shallow character of the lot there s no depth to him at all especially later in the book he starts out promisingly enough but after guenevere enters the picture he turns completely irritating and weepy and justblah great king i think not someone get the man a box of tissues and some midol also someone needs to inform the author that there are more color combinations out there than white and gold yes we get it everything is white and gold the dresses white and gold the wedding white and gold the color of their days white and gold the chamber pots probably white and gold too find another descriptor merlin is a lech who seems to pretty much be a crazy loon who enjoys wreaking havoc when he s not attempting to hop into bed with much younger and unwilling women morgan is so clingy and weepy at the start that it s really irritating obviously crying a lot runs in the family im not even halfway through the book yet and i hope it gets better it s good enough for some mindless entertainment but i enjoy books with a little more depth than this especially when they concern the legend of king arthur oh and the phrase thighfriendship really really gets on my nerves 
bad customer service i ordered this book and realized the day after i placed the order that my boyfriend had bought it for himself when i emailed the seller to see if it was too late to cancel my order and the reason i got no response i sent another email days later and i still never received a response i then got the book which i m stuck with and not even in good condition ! bad experience 
a disillusioning waste of time nicely drawn characters good writing different and compelling story why don t i like it then because of what the author did with these things it ends in disaster and proves nothing afterwards i find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth i wish to god i d never read it 
difficult to read i had to read this for book club and hated it the author writes in a dialect that is barely legible and makes the story less important than the dialogue yes we get the point now can you write in english so i can understand each sentence the first time i read it thank you ! 
too narrow minded the author spoke only from her point of view which was midwestern and christian she devoted a huge section to church weddings and a tiny section for any other kind which did not help me at all also she kept talking about not having a wedding outdoors which doesn t make any nature loving bride happy nor does it give a california bride tips on planning her outdoor wedding thirdly this book doesn t include many ethnic or cultural tips and traditions except for the tiny part on the jewish wedding try the unoffical guide to planning your wedding or the dummies book instead 
just ok although there is an intense void in the subject of trans and gender queer writings this book does little to fill it there are occational glimering voices of truth and clarity most notably the essay by the transman with ms but overall there was too much youthful exuberance and not enough thoughful mature writing i would much rather read a personal account of someone s reality than someone perched on a soapbox telling about how they live outside the gender binary although i believe gender is something worth deconstructing to not acknowledge that it exists in this world or to say you live outside of it without giving examples of how you make this possible shows to me a lack of maturity on the part of the writer i know mr diamond to be a very prolific artist but in this case i simply felt the quality was lacking 
mailing it in i ve been following the alex cross series from its beginning and after reading cat mouse i m wondering if patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go given the fact that there are or more cross books written subsequently to this one i can only hope that the series gets better my complains are similar to those of other reviewers i m getting sick of the perfection of alex cross the man s a saintly father saintly grandson saintly lover saintly charity worker and saintly detective these traits hooked the reader and made cross an intriguing character but he s fast becoming too one dimensional the cross sampson relationship as if we weren t sick enough of this already every few chapters we re reminded of the man crush cross and sampson have on each other sampson is so perfect in cross s eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time sampson enters a scene the cross christine johnson relationship moves way too fast one moment christine is still mourning the loss of her husband who was viciously murdered months prior in jack jill and freaks out over an innocent dinner date and the next she and cross are madly in love no development whatsoever no line from point a to point b i m not sure patterson could have written the dialogue between cross and his children any more unrealistically aren t these and yearold children he has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with sampson or kyle craig the entire novel is a series of pseudo climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field the soneji resolution was anti climactic at best and the mr smith conclusion was unfulfilling 
marginal this is the most misleading of books the title would have you believe gouverneur morris wrote the constitution a few more founding fathers naturally participated however morris was chairman of the committee on style which means morris was primarily responsible for making printed sense out of the legal mumbo jumbo he did this and did it well to include the preamble no mean feat but he certainly did not write the constitution as thomas jefferson wrote the declaration of independence nor did morris himself ever claim to if morris did write the constitution as richard brookheiser claims in the title why did brookheiser spend less that of the book reporting on what this work is purportedly all about the constitution and morris participation therein aside from being misleading this book just also happens to be very poorly written it is cluttered and confusing it is a shame the author does not give the reader a better opportunity to know morris morris lived and participated in some of the nation s most formative times if the author had given his subject more attention if he had said more about who morris was and how he interacted with the events of his time then this could have been a slam bang winner a blockbuster of a fine work instead the best thing that can be said is that it is a very cursory survey of the times in which morris lived mercifully it is short 
wishful thinking disguised as history of science this book should be titled something like the decline of the gene and good riddance too it s really just a potted and rather one sided historical sketch of some events in the development of genetics the author figures these stories will help her case against the idea that that there are genes for traits which act independent of the role of the environment and in just about any environment since this is something no one really believes its hard to understand what her beef with the gene really is 
unexpected trash l love reading lawrence block s matthew scudder novels and many of the author s other works but this particular effort is in my opinion pure out andout trash now the premise is excellent a man going over the edge because of the trauma and losses from the wtc bombings and initially someone else accused of the first murder and then begins the trash much of it totally unnecessary in particular the often depraved and carefully described sexual needs and actions of a female character who manages to become quite unsympathetic and near lunatic in her acting out of every possible sexual want not need want then there are several just plain hokey and or unclear aspects first the clearing of the first murder suspect very poorly explained and second determining who the murderer is was a yeah right reader s reaction and a few of the sub plots just become plain boring l find it difficult to believe that the author actually wrote this trashy novel the only suspicion l can come up with is that his agent or editor took too many liberties in an effort to spice up this l ong novel 
awesomely bad i have never been a fan of danielle steel s books and have only read a couple in my lifetime and those many years ago i m not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors extreme boredom insanity but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer s work actually i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was the writing was completely repetitive and superficial and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself it read like a poor book report and then he did this and then he did this and after that he did this and then he laughed we are told that the bachelors who struck me as commitment phobic a little neurotic and fairly immature despite their middle age but not necessarily toxic are decent likable guys but we never really see too much proof of that when the proof does come it s so ham handed as to be laughable charlie s eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character yeahsurerightwhatever most of the story is told through narration with little bits and pieces of ho hum dialogue the author adopted a third person point of view but there s certainly nothing omniscient about it and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable this is how men behave and relate to one another i find that hard to believe considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other i liked the female characters of the book initially they all seemed to be strong capable independent and emotionally healthy women but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous mountains out of molehills for instance gray the yearold artist who has always been phobic about family refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he s been with for several months and whom he claims to love nevermind the fact that he s known about the adult children since the very beginning nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy while gray and sylvia are new yorkers nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent self sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face toface visits evidently gray can t see beyond the fact that they are kids and therefore family and therefore not to be tolerated sorry but whatever sympathy i d developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity dump the weenie sylvia you can do better the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness and of course everything was wrapped up magically with sudden capitulation as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters their conflicts and resolution i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book and why i bothered reading i 
please baby please don t make me read this book again the sound of fingernails scraping against a blackboard doesn t bother me however the thought of having to read this book one more time to my year old daughter causes me to shudder uncontrollably this book was given to my daughter in a secret gift exchange at her school and i wish i knew who the secret gift giver was so i could return the generosity by giving them a dvd box set of the wiggles and while she does like the pictures i dread having to read this story to her whenever she asks do me a favor and read the following sentence out loud baby baby baby baby please baby please please please baby baby baby isn t that annoying well that s pretty much what drives the story the parents get on their daughter about different things throughout the entire book and that s how they end every single sentence dont be so slow baby baby baby dont splash the water please baby baby baby please baby please please baby grrr thank goodness it s short but when has anybody ever tried to coax their child into doing something by saying please eat your peas baby baby baby baby i read this and i feel like i m reading about a family living in a mental institution and on the very first page of the story the clock on the vcr is reading am why is the child still up and the t v on at that hour i know that children are rambunctuous and full of energy and all of that but i m more awake at am than my daughter is now why dr seuss doesn t annoy me and this does i can t tell you maybe it s because i found the mars blackmon character from shes gotta have it so overwhelmingly annoying and someone came up with the idea that that character should provide the narration of a children s story he was the one who spent the entire movie trying to get into nola darling s pants right okay im sorry i like an actual story when i sit down to read my daughter a bedtime story if the idea is to entertain children with annoying repetition well then it succeeds but i think it s possible to create a story without having to sound like an idiot while telling it 
disappointed my husband who is off fighting for the constitution sent this book to our daughter if he had not sent it i would want a refund my daughter and i sat down to read the book together she thought the drawings did not match the words and thought the author still did not like the preamble he makes mention in the begining that he was forced to think about the constitution there was no inspiration from this book and she hasn t picked it up again the pictures are not exciting to children and only vaguely connect to the words she loves the freedom rock version of the preamble and and really enjoys lynn chaney s america a patriotic primer so i understand why he made the purchase however it is not inspiring or uplifting or interesting 
poor service product misrepresented the book we received was not the full book with the isbn number we ordered it was volume one of two with a different isbn number which was clearly noted on the back of the book we had to send the book back at our expense 
need a fair mathematical background major steps were skipped a reader without a fair mathematical background would not understand why suddenly a statistical result could be used to replace the whole martingale equation a lot of assumptions were made on the knowledge base of readers therefore it is not an introductory text if the reader has a fair mathematical background the reader needs not start with this book if the reader does not have the background he can t understand this book this book is in the middle of nowhere in short the authors skipped too many steps an subjective opion it seems to me that the authors were very lazy to type 
disappointing i m a big fan of hooper s paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series however a fbi agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what i was expecting from a kay hooper book it was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided and i found the satan cult slant boring i think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books 
books do not quite cover it why daughters need their moms i don t think this book quite get s it it seems more atitle just so the authors can make some money off of it the so called touching photos that show moms and daughters together do not really show any touching emotion that they are suppoed to convey i ve seen better moving scenes of daughters hugging their moms in orange juice tv adds sure maybe the best was intented with this book but it does not deliver 
a more timid its not our fault and i suggest anyone reading this take it with a grain of salt the opening disclaimer of what is and is not antiamericanism is nice but definitions coming from israelis does raise the hairs on the back on my neck since there has been such a concerted effort by some israelis to seperate american from american not to mention the effort to seperate america from every one in the world except guess who israeli gave it two stars from being not totally overt in the popular gimmick of everyone hates you and even some americans hate america but drum role its not because of what you do it s because your rich and free if you like your propaganda served straight up bypass this book on the other hand if you like served with umbrellas and a cherry on top this is for you 
writers get some help ! please if it s true that everything is good for something even if it is a bad example this book might by used accordingly otherwise don t waste your time each chapter of this book is written by a different professional writer each with a story to tell about her particular life relationships etc i found it to be a disturbing and even appalling read on many levels for one these women are not typical in that they do not represent the rank and file of american women wives and mothers at least not the ones that i know ! they are professional writers who are urban educated liberal and comparitively affluent these women live and work primarily in academia the book is a compilation of chapters in which these writers rant whine confess and obsess about their relationships careers etc it misses the point of getting views from women of all walks of life and social status i found this book offensive in that because they have as writers the platform to flaunt their deviance and dysfunction sexually morally politically etc they play it off as normal and representative of the rest of us perhaps in their literary or academic worlds they are the norm but for the vast majority of us wives and moms out here in the real world i don t think so i got the impression that many of these women thought it was somehow a display of their writing prowess if they divulged more dark freaky wacko secrets and shocking confessions than their sister in the previous chapter be it on their affair with another woman a married man or their open marriage the hannah pine piece is particularly disturbing and i can see why she uses a pseudonym had her real name been used there would be no reason why this pitiful woman would not be carted off to the mental health ward she writes of the affairs she and her husband have had with other people and her obviously unsuccessful yet frighteningly denied attempt to justify the affairs as anything negative or unhealthy even priding herself on chosing to not be angry over her husbands habit of sleeping with other women afterall that could put a damper on his lust and we wouldn t want to restrict him in such an negative and oppressive manner puh leeze 
one star for this incredible mathematical disinformation this book and volume no deserves no any star however because the incredible lies it contains makes it get star as an example for those who still are confused to proof how many people can be trapped in this idiotic but genious fabricated disinformation its amazing and incredible how easy people can be getting catched by this secret government setup theories with false mathematical and wrong explanations and incorrect applications of the so called mathematical laws herein just think for example about the spiral case drawings made by halfway circles instead of an projection of the exponential function characteristics people must think for themselves if they don t check the so called refered mathematical explanations for themselves or they accept anything because it looks mathematical beautiful be very aware thus the population wants beautifully fabricated images instead of a written truth be aware ! i do not say the aliens do not exist i do not state the old civilizations and original ancient sciences named here are incorrect or never did exist i don not deny the spiritual and paranormal phenomena i state the suggestions and conclusions in this book are fabricated by a writer who has an agenda that fits to get confused people starving for truth and knowledge in his new agey web by a dirty way of spreading disinformation and false hints btw every serious researcher of spiritual stuff and conspiracies would already have to know the so called writer of this book is a patsy for the new world order agenda the name melchizedek suggests some integrity well he isn t using this aftername or synonym is a hot spot signal for the better would be critical reader i know a lot of readers will dislike my review i know people first shoot the messenger before they get grounded and finally wake up that s the way how life is all about sorry guys i don t have a more comfortable message which maybe fits in your flower life expectations or end of time philosophy with the availability of more of the so called vibrational dimensions given by drunvalo 
nearly useless very abstract and badly edited audition apparently seems to be some kind of unwanted stepchild of adobe based on the scarcity of resources adobe seems to have dedicated to it i bought this book based on other positive experiences with the visual quickstart guide series but as another reviewer states this book barely covers what should essentially be in a basic user s manual there is little if any detail very few case study example and some significant holes in the instructions example in the using cues section there is a section to list and edit your cues to move cues and to delete cues but it says nothing about creating a cue to start with these types of omissions can drive beginners insane and signals some pretty bad editing further abstract explanations of sounds or worse how sounds work are nearly useless this book badly needs an accompanying cd five seconds of actual audio can teach more that fifty pages of words avoid this book 
substandard reading not worth your money this book sounds like a sales person yelling in your ear the author is not an experienced photographer nor does the author offer any resonable useful tips very outdated material also from its not helpful for the serious digital or medium format photographer or even for an amateur its simply a waste of money amazon has better books for serious photographers for sure 
oops i bought this book on a friend s recommendation if i had been in a book store and could have read a page or two i would have known immediately it was not the type of book i would read i m sure it s wonderful for those who like it i passed it on to a friend 
don t waste your time nor money terrible book i followed the scott perterson trial and i agree with a guilty verdict so i thought it would be interesting to read what was going on behind those closed doors the editing was terrible the story was told very poorly names used were confusing they had nicknames sometimes the nickname would be written down the other time it was not so who the heck are they talking about now dont waste time or money 
record purchase entry of this book as a bad debt you know it s too bad these reviews can t be weighted because there s a class of about people with whom i took accounting in university that would trash this book make it for the prof who stepped in and had to use it it is not well written with information presented out of logical order it does not cover the materials sufficiently nor in enough depth trying to combine financial and managerial accounting in a book full of worksheet style pages that could have and should have been cheaply produced in an accompanying study or homework guide instead of built into a hard cover book that doesn t even have a lot of content to begin with it s a waste of money at just about any price not being able to teach the material never mind at its outrageous price i wish we could sue to get our money back on books that simply don t live up to standards i also wish there was a zero star rating or negative ones which indicate complete waste of time and or money never mind zero value to purchase and read 
some very informative text ruined by useless formulas biggest waste of i ve ever seen ! this was a required text in school and approximatly of the formulas were completely unusable it was if this character wrote these recipes off the top of his head without the slightest concern for whether they worked or not i shudder to think how many copies of this waste of paper have been sold to culinary students and the general public alike 
just dreadful as much fun as sitting in your accountant s office with your lap full of tax receipts of course there are worse things in life but please remind me of what they are better yet don t remind me ! 
big trouble starts early on interesting experimental fiction in big trouble barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn t sure who the story is about characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about which is not the psychodelic frog it s something less original the genre is also well disguised is it a comedy or a thriller if a novel is funny can we take the thriller part seriously enough in some cases yes when for example the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem in this case no it s a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around chained to an entertainment center while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex oriented crazy in all fairness the novel does feature a ticking clock which is handy to have in a thriller it s more effective if there is something believable about the story i expected a novel with an overdose of silliness but i was spared that which was a plus no characters with absurdly meaningful names the nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed while there was little depth to any characters that s probably less of a requirement for characters we want to laugh at the characters could have used some personality but that s a common flaw the novel should have been funny in places for a list of situations would show some potential but i had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout others would disagree the politically incorrect portrayal of miami was entertaining if not actually funny the overall effect of reading big trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say sir i know your name is a household word and i know we could make money on whatever you write but i have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to to something like this if there ever were such days 
unanswered prayers having never read a book by danielle steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels i was looking forward to reading answered prayers since i usually always find the books more deep and interesting sadly i couldn t have been more disappointed the first thing that bothered me about this novel was the amount of repetition it has i was just through the first few pages of the first chapter and i was already being told things usually insignificant which i had just read a few lines before secondly the moment brad is introduced into the plot i could foresee with certainty how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end so as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading i reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable the book couldn t possibly be danielle steel s number one bestseller as the cover proclaims seems like i have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a bestsellerthe major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other faith is sweet and caring has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own leaving her feeling lonely and sad her husband is cold unreligious and gives her no attention brad is sweet and caring has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own leaving him feeling lonely and sad his wife is cold unreligious and gives him no attention even faith s deep dark secret is too unoriginal and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book leaving no room for curiosity and suspense halfway through the book i was so bored that i considered giving up reading it altogether however i kept pushing on praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere to at least make reading answered prayers worthwhile unlike faith however my prayers remained unanswered it s going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a danielle steel novel again 
disappointing and i bought this book since it had the betty crocker name attached to indian cooking however the book is a huge disappointment to say the least it is a mish mash of north and south indian recipes some vegetarian and some meat dishes with no demarcation between anything recipe titles are poorly translated into english and the indian names are sometimes in hindi and sometimes in tamil while the pictures are tastefully done seems like raghavan iyer is otherwise confused if you are indian you definitely can do without this book and if you are a non indian looking to buy a good indian cookbook feel free to pass on this one there are better books out there 
not good not good this book is not good the author s style is good but the story goes nowhere the characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed waste of time 
disappointing i was not enchanted with such an ambitious title i expected a more lively and fulfilling work instead i was left waiting for moore to take ideas to a greater spiritual and intellectual level unfortunately this never happened for those who want more substance i suggest looking elsewhere 
disappointing this book should have been a collection of short stories it needs some heavy editing there are moments of real science fiction and story telling but it is burdened by preaching 
glad i didn t pay hardcover price i love suzanne brockmann s writing if she were any other author i d give it star this one just didn t do it for me i didn t like the heroine jane who seemed irritating immature and i didn t care about cosmo i guess the character development was lacking i couldn t identify with the gay fbi agent and the intern chasing the in thecloset actor storyline was a flat out bore i read romance for escape one of the last things i want to do is escape into a homosexual love story i never finished her last book an extremely disappointing read the one abt the cia agents i don t know if i m going to finish this one i certainly hope max gina s story doesn t follow this pattern of poorly developed characters 
an interesting mix of good and bad im not really writing this review to sway anyone s opinion of it tastes are different from person to person some may love this book others may hate it and a few will think its okay that is just the way things are i only wanted to share my opinion about it because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever i think about it the first time i read this book i hated it i have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice i still don t like this book at all yet during both times that i read it i could not put the book down this is the bizarre duplicitous nature of the relic i do not like the story or the characters but still i have been drawn in as much as i hate to admit it i consider this book to be a real page turneri don t think i need to go into the plot so i will list the offenses this book commits once again this is just my opinion predictability i dont think i was surprised even once while reading this book it gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days from the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul or merely here to serve as entree s for the monster the outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all not to spoil any surprises but i ll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief s escape route throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and well i think you allready know where this is going poor characters all your cliche s are here from the overworked underappreciated heroine who puts all the pieces together to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums premier even after numerous grisly murders why do you ask because of revenues of course i wonder if the museums head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie jaws if the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do if i heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum i was gaurding especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity i would call for backup before i investigated of course i am sane so reverse what i would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take unbelievability there were many times while reading this book when i had to stop and say give me a break i also used the expressions oh please and that is so stupid many times we are expected to deny common sense and reason so that the story can progress of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet then this book would probably only be pages long so in an effort to stretch it out to or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank im not kidding this monkey lizard is shot no less than times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects i don t want to give anything more away but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book many what a rip off moments to often while reading this book i found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it there is a reason so many people compare this book to jurrasic park many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of chricton s book so instead of putting the quote far above chricton s jurassic park on the cover of the relic i would have put not above taking ideas from better books put jurrasic park congo and jaws in a blender and you have the relic this borrowing of ideas seems so bad at times that i wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of the relic sold micheal chricton received royalties once again i feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity and predictability i could not put this book down for that reason alone this book is probably worth reading and sharing with your friends then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another probably better book 
something like an enema i m going to wait until it gets cold enough to burn this guy s book oblivion couldn t be a better title while reading these stories i couldn t actually bear to finish even one of them you feel as if you have entered some circle of hell and your punishment is to have to read all this crap this guy makes me mad his prose actually bores into your skull it feels like torture to read and you want to say enough yes i will tell you anything you want to hear but please just shut the blank up 
drivel presented with enthusiasm and gusto this is your typical self help motivational book you can do it ! think you can and you can its all up to you and in your power all you need is an idea stick to it and be rich beyond your wildest dreams simple fixes for all of life s complex problems ya rightsave your money i ll cut to the chase for you drive and determination will be what you need to succeed in anything worthwhile in this world stick to it and have a positive outlook got it good now you can spend what you would have on this book on something more worthwhile dont get me wrong there is some useful stuff to be gleaned here yes mental outlook is huge to success but it s still not a guarantee as the book would have you believe too many illogical and unsubstantiated conclusions and just plain wrong inferences and explanations for my taste 
if i only had a brain why do i keep doing this to myself i swear on a stack of bibles i will not read another self help book again and then someone begs me to try just this one what can i say when i am beseeched with mr reader you re a smart guy so this is the book for you well right off the bat i had the same question as other reviewers is eric jansen a neurologist or a physician or is he involved with cutting edge technology mapping neurons and the synaptic flows well the answer is no he is not any of the above but like most of us he has read a lot and has some ideas about improved learning using a carrot and stick aproach to our brain there are some reasonably good ideas here but nothing startling original or life shatteringone thing that i began to detest was the refrain that we must learn with the brain in mind as if there were some secret ways human beings learn without using the brain we get a round of memory techniques why we retain some data and lose other effective methods for instilling long term retention tricking the brain what the author is attempting to do is suggest that the brain operates in certain patterns and our attempts at learning should incorporate those known patterns but i found absolutely nothing new here of course no startling discoveries or deep insights about how the brain works there are some common sense suggestions but beyond that i think most teachers are aware of methods for teaching children that optimizes normal thought patterns much of this is editorializing over the sorry state of schools and i agree that our educational system needs a radical makeover for the future what i cannot accept is the fluff he throws out with the occasional factoid about the workins of the brain as if he had answered some ageold question think with your brain and avoid getting this book 
hardly spine tingling it has all the right elements nazi conspiracies international intrigue duplicity galore but they simply don t gel together in the breathtaking way i ve come to expect from a ludlum novel the back cover blurb about the august attempted coup in moscow initially caught my attention so i bought it and eagerly dug in no suspense no edge ofmyseat anticipation i remained quite firmly in my comfy chair i repeated there has got to be more about the coup in here somewhere so often that it became a mantra to keep me from throwing the book away in frustration there were about pages worth of material on the coup i could do better than that just by having watched it on cnn interesting book yes worthy of the robert ludlum name a most definite no i noticed that the ghostwriter s name appears nowhere on in the cover nor on amazon s entry that should be a telling clue in itself 
katz does have a problem but it isn t a midlife crisis jon katz does have a problem but it isn t a midlife crisis this is a book about an unemployed new jersey writer who deserts his family for a couple of months to quotfind himself quot by embarking on an odyssey to a local vermont vacation home only to find that he s bored and runs back to his family for entertainment and a cure for his own shallowness the quotmountainquot is a hill off a local vermont highway the quotspiritual transformation quot is analogous to that of a couch potato who feels hungry during monday night football and heads back to the fridge to discover replenishment the man has no insight his thoughts and observations are as shallow as howard stern he attempts to lend some credibility and substance to his ramblings by comparing himself with thomas merton and dragging merton anecdotes in to pad the book where katz clearly has nothing substantive to offer save a tree and avoid this book at all costs better yet write your own and offer the rest of us something worthwhile to ponder rather than this drivel if you read this book you will understand why katz was unemployed when he wrote it 
too dark for me i read this book once it was allright but too dark and racy for me i like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts i liked some but i liked merrick better book was oka 
a real letdown what a disappointment this is after the superb pitt and monk detective novels set in victorian times someone at the publishing house should have had the courage to point out some problems to the writer she repeats information not once but many times apparently having forgotten that she had already said that the plot and denouement are not likely and are hard to follow for example the police supposedly look everywhere for the gun that killed sebastian and eventually it is deduced that the one place they didn t look was in the drain funnel on the roof of the master s abode and lo there it was wrapped in a cloth and stuck barrel down to prove that it was the fatal gun the cistern barrel for that downpipe is dry what say that again in short the characters the dialogue the atmosphere just don t measure up to the plunges the reader takes into the drawing rooms and rookeries of london circa rather than go into this series the reader would do well to go back and read the victorian books that s a sorry suggestion and i m sorry to have to make it 
don t waste your money my fiance was a best man in a wedding recently and had never given a speech before so i bought this book and another one boy am i glad that i bought the other book because this one was no help at all it only gives you examples of specific toasts and speeches for specific families it doesn t help it s not generic enough for someone to put together their own speech from it it doesn t tell you how to write a speech or do s and don ts about writing toasts i would not recommend this book to anyone if you want a good book for this buy the best man s handbook it has way more useful information on speeches and toasts than most speech books 
borderland unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct ukraine does not mean borderland the oldest use of the word found in written text is in the th century chronicle of slava o polke ihoria the term ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom at the heart of the kingdom the opposite of what the author writes borderland would mean okraina this is the difference between in and out she also missed that ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to another significant fact maybe the next book could be an new history based on archives from lutsk and kyiv that the author did not read missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book 
power of intention vs secrets of the power of intention i listened first to the power of intention which was the reason i purchased the secrets of the power of intention i found the secrets of the power of intention to be a long version of the power of intention by far the power of intention is a disc that will fire up ones sense and the drive to learn more and more the secrets of the power of intention is boring and makes you upset that you even purchased the set it bring little to lite over the first disc i would love to return the disc s not worth the money 
book description this book comes after devils embrace and is about their son and daughter the in print version has been re written 
somewhat terrible to start with i have seen pretty much all of the wolf s rain anime i may have missed a few episodes and it wasen t all that great anyway the ending for great s sake the only thing outstanding in the anime was the music logically nonexistent in the manga still i bought the manga in hopes that it would differ from the anime in some respect perhaps end better although the end is yet to come i already dislike the manga mostly for the artwork more precisely the wolves whose legs resemble those of a girrafe s and kiba is supposed to be fluffy but his fur looks much too stringy in the manga also instead of selectively leaving out a few parts they seem to have selectively chose a few parts to actually draw ! it seems almost like a summary they have so few scenes what really ticks me is that my favorite part of the entire series which i didn t even like the scene where quent shoots under blue smacking the crap out of kiba is left out the entire charm of showing how in tune blue and quent are is left out i just can t wait to see the second book which i bet won t even show an ending so much for this series the only thing worth money are the two cd sps one last thing that just struck me as odd and out of place the text on the front of the book wolfs rain is pink not just a little bright pink almost any other color would do for this depressing anime oh and another thing something good the bonus thing at the end of the book i liked that very nice 
the word tocontent ratio is dismal i was hired as a cable subcontractor last summer under the assumption that the contract owner was going to make me his company manager and crew supervisor knowing more about public relations marketing and journalism than management i did what any good college student would do i ordered some books and got to studying michael gerber s books sounded good in the summaries and had promising endorsements and blurbs on the jackets but they were misleading his books manager and contractor have little in the way of tangible methods and practices that you can jot down into notes and use the book seemed to focus on anecdotes and points that were spread out over so many meaningless paragraphs that their consistency was almost that of vapor as i said i tried taking notes or more accurately i sat there with a pad of paper and pen on the verge of jotting something down none of it seemed worthy of the effort and what little of value there was was spread out over so many pages of verbosity that the undertaking would have been headache inducing this book and his others seem to be aimed at managers who need self help assistance to fix their life away from management in this case the subtitles should read the e myth manger why your life sucks as a manager and what to do about it and the e myth contractor why most contractors marriages don t work and what to do about it seriously these books are that bad 
wait for the cliffs notes this book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than i am but while i was reading i kept asking myself whens he going to get to the point the first part of the book is all about why it s good to be rich something i thought was unnecessary the bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle class and poor finally in the last part of the book he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy this was the only part of the book i was interested in to me it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a page book on investing and so kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with fluff however even his advice is considered questionable by many experts i would say that the main idea i got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd i just wish i hadn t invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise 
don t waste your money after spending a lot of money to buy the book and the ingredients for recipes in this book everything i tried was a tasteless flop you ll be better off to use regular recipes and just leave off the salt 
disconnected this novel is narrated by a senior at an exclusive boys boarding school portrayed as the type of place where all of the students are hiding their true selves those who are wealthy try desperately to hide that fact and those who are on scholarship as is the narrator try even harder to hide their heritage as this story is told from the point of view of one character it is impossible to determine if this is actually true or if his fear of being exposed as a fraud clouds his vision of everyone else it is hard for me to believe that these boys are so disconnected from each other according to the narrator nobody is really friends with anybody else despite the fact that they have been living with each other for so many years no student has any real relationship with any other student what is real is literature writers are artists who form their own social club and are therefore able to escape the boxes into which their heritage has forced them it seems every boy at school aspires to write and once every semester the class is rewarded with a visit from a famous author these visits are paired with writing contests in which boys submit a piece of writing in the style of the famous author the student whose writing is chosen by the visiting author is rewarded with a private audience with him or her an unbelievable honor for the student the narrator of the book is desperate for one of these audiences and devastated when his opportunity to interact with robert frost and ayn rand passes him by when he finds that ernest hemingway is to be the next visiting author he is willing to do anything even plagiarize a story he comes across in a literary magazine to meet the famous man some of the parts of this story are interesting especially those focused on the visiting authors i particularly liked the passages about ayn rand and was delighted when a boy asked her quite seriously who is john galt and received nothing but looks of utter loathing in response i also liked the responses of the authors to the works of the students the boys submitted very earnest bits of poetry or fiction that were terribly misinterpreted by the authors who judged them and read much more into them than the boys had ever anticipated or expected however i didn t really connect with any of the characters perhaps because the narrator of the story never got close to anyone he talks about his roommate and how the two of them lived together for years and kept seeming like they might become friends but it never really happened in fact the narrator although friendly with many seems to have no actual friends there is only one girl who might be a love interest in the story but the narrator also has only minimal feelings for her in the end this lack of interest for anyone in the story left me feeling rather uninterested in everything as well 
a very credible book except it was interesting to read a review that commented it is still true you can not find any study in those countries about christianity that statement is absolute fiction of course especially in the jesuit schools in syria perhaps in the west it has slipped our minds that jesus was born in the middle east and we adopted this middle east religion from them the eastern churches very much study christianity and many muslims around them in the levant since jesus is reverred in islam john the baptist s head is maintained in a memorial monument in the middle of the ommayad mosque in damascus the most noted manuscripts used for our common bibles today were discovered in alleppo syriacursory research reveals lewis s connections to intelligence and that speaks for itself this book should be read to balance it in conjunction with hostage to khomeini and venices war against western civilization unless one wishes to be taken for a very sophisticated ride better still one could reside in the middle east for a while and see for one s self instead of amplifying other people s writings without the slightest ability credential or experience to determine whether or not they might be accurate but be ready for shock it has little in common to the psy ops portraits we have been spoon fed with by western media moronic television porgammes suchas fox and artful books such as this its still a fine read and awfully convincing it hit it s mark in that respect much knowledge on christianity one wonders of the author hails from christian ancestors continuing the other review that people in the middle east would supposedly benefit greatly from reading this book was also amusing to say the least people from the middle east would benefit best from a good lawyer and a truth serum given the looting and plunder of their resources 
wasted opportunity sensationalist titiliating and as a result a total let down much like heavier than heaven while cross s journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re jimi s early years after that it reads like hammer of the gods meets the national inquirier just plain silly and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever cross spends more time examining jimi s proclivity for groupies and drugs which of course is part of the story i guess than the music itself it would have been nice to know say in preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame nyc how did hendrix come to write the songs that comprised are you experienced how did his playing transcend his predecessors how did dylan influence his songwriting we learn hendrix did emulate dylan s hair we don t know now if cross was unable to formulate answers on his own then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics musicians and fans who d be happy to extrapolate instead we get only crumbs which are ultimately overshadowed by second hand stories from druggies jimi didn t like alcohol ! ex groupies jimi wanted to marry me ! and hangers on jimi slept with chicks at once it was thorougly exasperating if you came from mars and read this your impression would be that yes jimi was messed up and reckless but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world if the book meant to honor hendrix it did the opposite if you want incisive analysis of the music itself simply read amazon readers reviews of his records the fans themselves not an overwrought author can encapsulate the power and beauty of hendrix far better and far more consisely 
editorial review i was hoping to purchase an actually funny take on life and the crazy relationship between pets and their owners all i bought was the comparability between terrible and horrible have we not seen this formula before in other strips it tries to be cute then it tries to be sarcastic all to poor results i have a cat but that does not make this lame strip likable my cat has more personality than all the week characters portrade here how about something original 
nothing stirs up hate like calling people nazis authors should find real jobs instead of creating witchhunt after witchhunt looking for those evil militia people who want to blow up the world this stuff would be laughable if it wasn t so serious the left cries about mccarthism but is doing the exact same thing here by creating villians and devils where there are none peddeling hate and fear even if based on loose facts or lies works for some 
not worth purchasing i found the recipes in this book to be simple and bland i am actually in the process of returning the book anyone who cooks can come up with combinations better than this 
well researched poorly written miserably edited in all my very many years of reading i ve never come upon so haphazardly edited a volume as this one it reads like the second draft of a manuscript that required four or five large chunks of text reappear verbatim on later pages sometimes it seems as though the publisher simply gathered up the author s notes on a work in progress and published them the writing itself is ungrammatical filled with constant misusage of the sort that should make any reader wince and unendingly in need of the rewrites which clearly never came in sum this book reads more like an average student s eighth grade test paper than a scholarly work the author has also decided to include some short odd entirely fictional writings of his own on the subject these make an uncomfortable indeed pointless addition to what purports to be a carefully researched work that having been said there are indeed points of interest here in occasional almost random spots along the way you ll find revelations and statements that indeed shed new light on the fall river murders the book s also loaded with pictures and drawings a good many of which i d never seen before in sum this is a book which makes a good though small reference addition to the library of a serious lizzie student but be prepared for a rough ride the writing and the editing are throughout in keeping with the title amateurish and sorely lacking 
history with a flare i enjoyed this book because of the way she blended history with a good story that keep you readin 
tiresome tiresome tiresome though i was intrigued by the novel after reading eco s the name of the rose i found the book unbearably dull it took me about six months to finish it just because i kept picking up other more interesting books to read i eventually suffered through it i have seen this book numerous times on bargains shelves in various stores and i always have to fight the urge to complain to management about having the nerve to sell such a laborious read the name of the rose receives high marks from me baudolino not so much 
a mediocre and oversensationalized story i had to read this book in ninth grade honors english i thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time i had ever expended when i was done now that i m in college however i do not despise the book as much i still feel that it is of very little value had the author been white and not helped along by ophra this work would be largely unnoticed it s just another story about how someone had a rough life with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it the reason i have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work maya angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda again if maya angelou was white and was not well liked by ophra the book would have flopped i would not recommend this at all especially if you are a conservative 
animal farm revisited marjorie kelly stands heads above her comrades in shouting the old adage from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs from the father of wealth discrimination karl marx she pounds her pulpit to not just reform our economic society but to invert it her scheme for change requires more government intervention and less free capitalism she is clearly in left field the fedgov through their meddling in forbidding areas has created the mess we are seeing today corporations are abiding to compliant ethics established by meddling government bureaucrats and no more free capitalism abides to the divine ethics and does unto others as they would want done unto them ms kelly and those who like this book should reread animal farm visit the von mises website or check economic books by carson hazlitt or sennholz 
posing for high school seniors i bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects and given most other people s ratings i decided to give it a try however upon opening the book my first thought was these all look like high school yearbook photos which is exacltly what they are it seems that that s primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market his main concern which he stresses throughout the book is creating a saleable picture and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom since she s usually the one with final say over the pictures a better title for this book would have been how to take high school senior pictures even then most of the pictures are not very good both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book in addition the poses are unnatural and awkward looking and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors to be fair the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject but there is really very little useful information here so if you re interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a sears portrait this may be the book for you however if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner i d steer clear of this book 
more harm than good although i appreciate that the author would share her story of moving from a scary m s diagnosis to a more positive health path i found this particular book disturbing in its lack of empathy and credit to others instead it reads like a long list of proud directives from a mother of five who researched this works out six days a week has her own elliptical trainer goes skiing does pilates has a black belt in karate attends fund raising galas and counts hollywood celebrities as close personal friends the author is obviously rather fortunate her disease does not appear to progress and she makes no reference to financial need holding a job raising children reality check with m s there is often extreme fatigue constant pain and great uncertainty whether we do everything this author suggests or nothing the disease will progress rapidly in some and remain almost completely inactive in others some of what is written is valid we can do much to help ourselves but i would hate to think that someone newly diagnosed as i am could feel like it was their own fault if their disease worsened all because they didn t follow the many orders in this book ms davis shows no empathy for those who smoke or drink or eat poorly these are real addictions and habits which are surely not any easier to kick when also facing a life with m s and will those who know nothing of m s now look at someone on crutches and assume they just hadn t tried like this author finally credits please bill withers wrote lean on me full lyrics appear without his name dr roy laver swank was instrumental in developing an m s diet which is largely what davis describes 
an innocent abroad jilts clio christopher catherwood a professor affiliated with cambridge university s institute of continuing education has written this book on the modern history of what has come to be called iraq putting churchill s name into the title makes the book so much easier to market to those americans who react to churchill s name with the same giddiness that any mention of the beatles once elicited from teenage girls to his credit catherwood has tried to cut through the fog of ideology and propaganda to get to the bottom of what happened unfortunately his undertaking wasn t even close to successful for example catherwood claims that the oil companies had no way of being sure that iraq had oil deposits at the time that the iraqi boundaries were drawn this despite the fact that crude oil had been seeping up to the surface in iraq since biblical times when because it was deemed a medicine had been brought by caravan to such distant places as china natural gas also made its way to the surface and would catch fire in eerie flames that the iraqis attributed to ghosts these indisputable facts utterly refute the world according to catherwood that this book has to offer catherwood implies that the british were only interested in iraq s oil because of its military use one almost hears undertones insisting that the british only wanted a platonic relationship but neglects to mention the close ties between shell oil and the admiral who fanatically urged advocated that the royal navy transition to oil these ties were so close that some of his colleagues were convinced that he had some financial stake in the deal i could write further paragraphs in this vein were i ever to write a book on a subject so shrouded in disagreement as iraq s history i would make sure to first talk with knowledgeable people from the region and then consult the writings of academics unfortunately catherwood seems to only have done the latter to his colossal book s detriment clio must feel slighted the only reason i don t give the book a single star is that there are even worse books on the subject

boutiful imagery ultimately fails illuminate i got this book after many glowing reviews by others and also on the recommendation of my coach and after reading it cover to cover several times and really trying the exercises this book is unfortunately consigned to the dusty corner of my shelf the imagery may be helpful to some people in developing the correct feel but none of the images worked for me neither did any of the alternates that my coach suggested i simply could not feel what sally swift was trying to get across with her colorful metaphors as a very practical horseman i like my books to have a great deal of technical aspects of riding so i did not appreciate swift s use of zen and mysticism borrowed from the martial arts world so bottom line for me imagery did not work at all as a teaching method i have plenty of imagination i m an engineer with a number of papers and patents to my name and i m also a fantasy artist but i learn in a very technical manner explain to me how this aid applied in this manner encourages the horse to use this group of muscles in this manner and i can do it and get the desired results every single time because i understand the why of it but tell me to feel it in any flowery language you want and you might as well be talking to a brick wall if you can imagine what it feels like for your forearms to turn into water hoses then this book will likely be good for you but if you re like me and have no idea then save your money as there are much better riding texts out there 
superficial advice save your money this book was a big waste of money the information is so basic only a real novice would learn anything and don t believe the positive reviews you read for kelly s books it s obvious he wrote them himself since no one with a brain would praise the kind of junk he puts out 
too female centerd this book is really geared toward women who are into feminism all the quotes in the book are from women in her groups if you re not into the female identity world pick another book 
a show book i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it psh that s nothing i ve had mine for over a year and still haven t finished it for starters the characters aren t especially likeable and the author seems more intent on impressing us with his obviously thorough research than on telling a good story i suspect this is a show book one of those books folks buy because it looks good to have on one s bookshelf but that doesn t necessarily get read i was disappointed 
my baby is a person not a thing while this book does contain good information it s presented in a way i couldn t get past in an attempt to read like the owner s manual for a machine like a car or a stereo system the book consistently refers to the baby as the model it was obviously meant to be cute but in my opinion it fails in that respect i m very much turned off by referring to babies in the same way you would refer to your washing machine my baby is a person not a thing to its credit the book does explain how each baby is unique but it does so by pointing out that some models do this and some models do that again i m turned off by referring to the baby as a model 
i hate this book this is one of the worst books i have ever read i understand that is fine writing but the book is tasteless i find rodriguez arrogant and lonely is he trying to say that the turning point of his life was when the nun s came to his parents home i hate this book it is one of my worst reads ever 
pretty bad why did i think a book about a blue shoe was going to be an interesting read i can hardly give this book a one star i ve read some pretty awful books but this is the only one thus far which has compelled me to write a review first of all where does mattie live i live in seattle and it doesn t rain as much as it does at the ryder house why is it always raining and why is it so important to tell about every time the author wrote about the weather it was ho hum here we go again it pulled me right out of the story there were other times too that i was painfully aware of the writing like with some of the author s bad analogies the one about the cats being like secret service agents was definitely one of them i am a cat lover and owner and don t get where lamott came up with some of her descriptions and actions of the cats while some of the analogies were very cutesy they certainly didn t have any ring of truth to them overall lamott s characters were only two dimensional at best and i found none of them to have any redeeming qualities lamott s descriptions throughout the book were awkward and redundant how many times can you use the description nuzzling it came to be that every time i saw that word i had to laugh when mattie isn t nuzzling her children or smelling the back of their necks she s totally neglecting them or wanting to peel them off her like starfish or whatever that other bad analogy was mattie is a horrible person and a horrible mother sorry i just couldn t relate and didn t want to i haven t always had a perfect life or the best moral judgment myself but my god get over it mattie grow up and quit your whining i do have to confess that this book wasn t so bad that i had to put it down midway through like some readers though i easily could have yes the writing was bad and the story and characters lacked substance but it was plain and simple enough that at least it was an easy read one you could pick up at random if you had or minutes to spare maybe i only read the book in its entirety so i could justify writing a review about it halfway through it was making me so crazy that i went on line to read some reviews id heard amazing things about this author and i had to know is it just me it was reassuring to find that many others felt the same way that i did kind of a support group for the mundane journey lamott was trying to take me on like many other reviewers i read lamott s bird by bird a friend who is an avid fan of anne s gave me the book as a gift and i fell in love i wanted to read everything by anne lamott now i m not so sure i will most likely give her another shot sticking only to her non fiction there is so much truth and humor in her non fiction that just doesn t seem to translate well into a novel i feel like this book never should have made it to print with a lot more work it might have earned a full one star rating 
not what it appears if you read the outside cover of the cd audiobook you get the impression that the volume strongly will deal with the manner in which fdr and eleanor roosevelt led the country during world war ii however what you get is more often innuendo about fdr s fascination with women other than his wife whether his prviate secretaries a visiting princess or his mistress of many years eleanor is covered in more detail than was expected but she comes off pretty well her husband s wandering eye notwithstanding goodwin does provide some insight into the challenges of running the united states during the critical war years but the amount of time devoted to private pursuits was not what was expected i had hoped for a lot more detail on the warimte effects of the economy and the challenges it served the president i had hopes of more on fdr s handling of race and labor issues but did not get it i had hopes of learning more about fdr s partnership with the congress to achieve the nation s goals but was disappointed there as well this was the first goodwin book i picked up and it didn t put me off enough to avoid her amazingly good team of rivals about lincoln and his cabinet still i remain disappointed that the book s cover and inside clearly focused on other issues than what was projected 
a perfect letdown i ve read over thrillers mysteries during the past years and this novel ranks as one of the five worst the story is a complete bore and the killer is so perfectly obvious that it seems that the only way the author keeps the story moving is to include monotonous drama about a sexually abused teenager and an emotionally limited inspector the title the ending and the loose ends are all meaningless and disappointments the moral of the story don t pay attention to the rave reviews on the inside flaps 
pathetic i bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane not one of my better decisions very wordy and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it s totally absurd reminds me of the way the cops talked in dragnet we are talking zero development of characters perhaps mr woods feels he doesn t need to give any depth to characters that he s been writing about in previous books well he s wrong you basically just don t care about these people they aren t real and they talk weird not much action either unless you count actions like they got in the car they got in the boat they got in the plane you get the picture this is another case of a well known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money don t fall into his trap like i did there are a lot better books out there 
pretentious self indulgent don t bother this book has to be one of the most pretentious and self indulgent books i have ever read the author seems to care very little for her reader and just tries to show off her supposed skill with language in the hands of nabokov or rushdie such experimentalism is genius and beautiful in the hands of ali smith it is clumsy and self indulgent in fact this book made me angry whatever happened to telling a good story or developing characters it is as though ms smith just spewed up whatever was in her head on to the page with very little thought into how to make her characters complex give the themes any depth or subtlety or advance the narrative and to think she received critical acclaim for this book ugh bring back nabokov ! i weep at the thought that this is the future of good literature 
not the caliber of jensen s former books i eagerly looked forward to buying and reading this book having read jensen s other books i have come to appreciate his willingness to address the ills of this society however i was deceived by the title which i felt would discuss revolution or solutions to the ills of this society here is the final line to the book quotthere is much work to be done what are you waiting for it s time to begin quot to be honest i expected more i could not shake the feeling that jensen s recollection of the class discussions were half made up if you are seeking a book that looks at how a teacher can institute a no grading policy in class while seeking to institute a non hierarchal classroom then this book may be for you i say may because being a teacher myself i have already played with these ideas and more i liked at times how jensen addresses the free loader problem within the system he uses and although he fixes this problem within his classes he never discusses the ramifications of his solutions or the ramifications of letting a free loader turn in more than one or two recycled papers throughout the semester hence the disappointment of the book i honestly found myself saying three quarters of the way through the book quotwhat a waste quot and quotthis feels like filler quot to sum up jensen s previous books are wonderful because i knew what i was getting this book i felt did not address the issue of change revolution and thus i was not satisfied be free thinkers and then what bring back the renaissance era what happened to the hippies in the s they got jobs how do we negotiate idealism and realism the solution must address both 
practical design of safety critical computer systems much of the content of this book is devoted to fault tree analysis and common sense applications of redundancy the book equates safety critical with low failure rates failures of any frequency are intolerable i was expecting to see fault coverage techniques using inference instrumentation and safe fail methodologies contrary to other reviews i found this book to be very light 
not for football fans having first seen the movie i was prepared that this was not a starry eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football but i was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read i have never been so dissapointed with a book on football or all of sports for that matter i enjoyed next man up and a civil war due to feinstein s balance between negative and positive lights on the game bissinger in friday night lights shows no such balance he does not follow the season in any logical fashion sometimes skipping entire games and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics honestly you ll see the name of michael dukakis more than you will the name of permian s starting quarterback i love football i love high school athletics and found this book to be very annoying check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it 
self knowledge the only paragraphs worth reading are the once heller got from other books i d suggest you d read those if you want to know about the tsangpo s history otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self knowledge but seems to know what lindgren the expedition leader thinks and feels heller criticizes others but doesn t have the gut to look at his own actions 
this is perhaps the weakest book that iles ever written this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good i ve read all iles complicated yet fasinating novels most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed but this hours didn t hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes over minutes i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re reading it again the other books such as the quiet game sleep no more blood memory dead sleep are all great reading experiences his first and second ones were just too jewish focused concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles although after hurricane katrina the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right not as good as what iles described in his novels all said this time no cigar for you poncho 
really bad gee whiz this is just a not so great book the problems are much harder than the actual gre and test abstruse stuff and your knowledge of specific equations the review in the front i guess is sort of okay in that it lists a lot of differents equations that might be helpful but the questions are terrible 
good concept badly written like all james patterson s books this was a good story idea but poorly executed patterson s characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever but the dialog runs from awkward to silly and his pacing is often confusing and forced that s why his books do better as movies a better writer gets to use patterson s concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
as i read i was filled with hope in the end i was disappointed throughout the book two separate stories take place one is a record of bob dubois whose life is ruled by circumstances and bad life management skills the other tells of vanise dorsinville a young haitian woman who struggles to survive as she makes her way to america neither is a pretty story and when the two characters finally meet it gets even worse when i finished reading this book i was angry at myself for muddling through all the italicized haitian accent dialogue and french creole voodoo terminology yah mon true 
booooooring i had never heard of this author before and picked this book on cd up at the library it moved at a snails pace the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters finally when something does happen by the th cd its anticlimactic and althought he main character continually talks about being psychic she never once has a premonition other than feeling spiderwebs when she walks in a room i couldn t wait for this book to end and i will probably never pick up another book by this author even though other reviewers say she writes good books i kept wondering if it would be better if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd that didn t help matters 
overall there is no need to purchase this card set the main problem with orgocards is that it is not really a set of two sided flash cards it is simply a shortened text book in card form the cards are not x index cards and they contain a lot of information on them much of which is not really necessary you are better off making your own flashcards 
misleading mis informed missed the mark much of the coverage is incomplete and misleading souder in his work entitled project selection and economic analysis provides a much more useful cogent and useable account of selecting and rating projects if roi is to be used as the key selection tool ! the book touts the benefits of critical chain with zeal but with limited if any defensible evidence for those new to professional project management the book provides much cheerleading but little value related to delivery of projects within the context of a viable well managed competitive business environment the book s reference list is anemic assessment of the broad scope and depth of information related to pmos and portfolio management is questionable while somewhat dated pace by mcgrath and portfolio management by kleinschmidt et al provide far more definitive proven actionable and valuable insight and direction 
i was coerced into buying this what sort of psycho would ever buy a book like this if they weren t forced to and where do these sadists get off charging this much for this load of crap you can buy a handsome boxed set of the iliad and odyssey don quixote the tain and penguin s collection of the norse sagas and still pay less than you would for the bedford reader do you think the bedford reader comes close to being a fraction as significant worthwhile enlightening or entertaining as any of those books neither do i but the ego maniacal swine who publish this would apparently beg to differ with you about the book s contents it s a bunch of watery pc multiculti crap do you think your fatuous lefty professor would assign you anything that wasn t i didn t learn a friggin thing from it and i resent every second i had to spend skimming through it the only reason i resold it instead of burning it at the end of the course which i got an a in was that the company that publishes it made one less sale thereby in summary i assume that if you re looking at this book it s because it s been assigned to you poor you 
sub standard i refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn t really write this i will try to describe him or her definitely a vegetarian possibly a member of peta dry writing style well crighton is dry even when he s excellent it bothers me how many unrealistic characters crichton uses it seems every character in some of these books earned a phd from mit by was an alternate on the olympic swim team a top researcher an accomplished pilot beautiful or handsome and wealthy these people do not exist in nature they also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete complex sentences quoting research in casual conversation but at least mc has a gift for crafting believable plausible sci fi much like isaac asimov but this is so beneath him i refuse to accept it 
too complicated thau over complicates her points the book is too difficult to understand i am an attorney who has been investing in stocks and bonds for over years this book is not appropriate for any level investor 
well played nick you took our money and didn t deliver city girl and i recently read the six books it was a delightful warm fun time drinking wine and reading a book a night by the fire i read aloud the male parts and she the female we would laugh and wonder and hypothesize and puzzle over the meanings they were wonderful memorable evenings my opinion of the books he should have stopped at the first one ! like a movie company that sees dollar signs after a successful first run nick wrote a sequel that was a shadow of the original the subsequent books prove to be good evidence that he had very little in mind as far as a story line goes and with the judicious application of vague confusing and nonsensical teasings he told us nothing just as jaws xxi and halloween xvi still brought the teenagers to the box office so will sabine becomes cleopatra and griffin returns to pleades bring bring the bantok herds stampeding into barnes and nobels the cash registers will ring nick will smile and the faithful will say may i please have some more i didn t like his artwork either 
two years later i read this book with an open mind in the beginning of what would be a lengthly ordeal that changed my life my ex wifes life and the lives of our two children forever my ex and i had some extremely destructive behaviors not to mention a very immature relationship that had never grown past our college sweetheart phase i took the advice offered by dr medved and weighed the pros and cons try to save my marriage a great idea had there actually been a marriage my relationship with my ex was roommates with benefits there was no partnership no respect no real love i had friends and relatives on both sides of the fence some supportive some turned away from me much thought and prayer went into the decision to divorce which was my decision alone it turned out to be the best decision for all four of us two years later i am the happiest i have been in my life through counseling and hard work i have made some changes that have made me a much better father husband remarried and friend my ex wife has a successful life of her own now and is also a much more involved parent our kids are well adjusted and thriving had i stayed in that relationship no matter how much work heart and soul would have been invested the habits of years would have crept in and the resentments of past would have kept us from growing the divorce cost all of us a great deal i would not do it differently dr medved pointed out the great costs emotionally financially spiritually of leaving but she failed to point out the costs of staying there is a price to pay for both 
sorta boring this being the first book i read by danielle steel i expected more than what i got since i love the moive verisons of her book the start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and i like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
not for a modern economist book is out of date with modern economic thought essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets 
sooooo last century s news the only reason to go for this book is if you are a real collector of sex instruction books and need to have this to complete your classics section this book was written a long time ago and is rather out of date and certainly not informed about alot of the really powerful devellopments in human sexuality which have occurred in the s and beyond i mean even lame sex instruction authors like nora hayden and lou paget do better than this re issue if you really want to get something worthwhile in this category you should look at free secrets of new sensual power by clint arthur that book is very modern and covers all the bases or go for something on video like dr corynna clarke s goddess worship which is a truly fresh and beautiful look at modern sensual healing 
here we are sept housing market is still going up my own views is us seeing the houseing market slowing down and homes in higher cost areas to come down one cause is because of intrest rates going up this putting most people out of the higher cost housing market lower and med price homes will stable off and someone i read on this form said her grandfolks wanted to buy a home to live in and stay and not do flips with the home the stock market has return to pre if you only held and not pick up cisco and the yahoo ect kept a index fund your doing fine today even better if you kept buying in the down turn if your buying to hold a good house to live in maybe even buying a extra home for a rental just keep in mind wise words just live within your belt and take it in one knoch ride the waves and if homes do come down in a crash or just a few rungs go buy some more the market will return and start going up remember the housing crash in the s those same homes today are the same ones selling today for huge profits also remember more people move to the usa every year and this usa growth is not stoping if there is a crash keep some money on the side and buy buy buy buy if there is a crash use it to get your retirement years in order buy and hold and when the market returns sell some and live on the rents of the others 
needs to be updated published in videohound s dvd guide is already outdated why because so many dvd titles both old and new are being released on a weekly basis that it is simply impossible to keep current anyone using this guide is bound to be disappointed in the large number of currently available dvds not listed until studios complete the transition of all or at least most titles from vhs to dvd such guides will continue to be out of date and of little use as for the actual content of videohound s guide it is adequate the reviews which are all subjective will strike a chord with some readers while striking a nerve with others one useful aspect is the rating of extra features outtakes documentaries trailers etc which make dvds so much fun unfortuneately videohound is inconsistent with its extras reviews for example the entry for the james bond classic quotgoldfingerquot fails to mention the two commentaries and two documentaries featured on the quotspecial edition quot release however the entry for another bond film quotthunderballquot does list all the extras overall this guide is a great idea however it needs fine tuning videohound s vhs guides are very good and i suspect that in a couple years when the transition from vhs to dvd is complete that videohound s dvd guide will also be up to par until then i d wait this one out 
disappointment this book starts out telling of the sack of rome and grabbing the reader s attention it s all down hill from there the next third of the book is a long drawn out build up with very little of the book actually dedicated to the finale of the build up the there is this a bit of drawn out rambling that leads into a sudden ending of the book it was almost as if the writer either got tired of writing and gave up or she just didn t know how to end it so she just ended it i was highly disappointed 
i love stone barrington books but not this one i had this one figured out by the second chapter too predictable and shallow hopefully the next stone book will actually be worth reading 
borrow or check this one out from a library i ll start by saying i know first hand that writing a novel is not easy with that said i didn t care to much for the author s style with this book she chose to narrate through the voice of her main character ceazia but she often mixed that up by telling what the other characters where thinking and feeling you can either tell it from one person s perspective or in order to incoporate everyone s thoughts and feelings tell it from the outside as you the author being the main narrator that was my biggest pet peeve with this novel another one was that certain instances and situations could have and should have been elaborated because after reading them i was like huh and because i read this one after married to the game it s sequel i know those situations were not spoke upon ever again i think she introduced too many characters and tried to juggle too many story lines it could have been a better book if she either elaborated or eliminated certain aspects of the story all in all i give stars for effort 
the only thing hidden is why people like this book read no further if you don t want some spoilers i don t recommend the book though and the whole thing is pretty much revealed in the first few pages so i wouldn t worry about it it s about a woman who is beaten nearly to death she thinks the perpetrator is her husband and her husband is sent to jail then her husband is released and someone else confesses to the crime all signs point to the fact that the new guy is actually the perpetrator and the book looks at our damaged protagonista s reaction to all this i had so many problems with this book that i must number them our heroine barely has a personality before she is savagely beaten and she certainly doesn t afterward it s hard to have a ton of sympathy for someone with no goals or hopes what does she want who the hell knows is this how the author sees women as having no goals or direction the fact that the guy who actually did it was a stranger this is unlikely especially when all signs point to the husband and the husband has a history of hitting his wife so what is the message here women think that their husbands are the culprits but they are not women lie it is a woman psychiatrist who helps our heroine remember that it was her husband who did it all the men in the book are controlling jerks even the ones who are supposed to be sympathetic and working for her own good all the women are attached to men and that s pretty much all that defines them this book is supposed to be so amazing because it s a man writing from a woman s point of view but it sounds like he used the method that jack nicholson s character does for writing women in as good as it gets i think of a man and then i take away reason and accountablility 
be aware of faux liberals colmes is an invention by faux news he cant even be considered a faux liberal because he was invented to be pawn hannity suh pawn so he can announce that there will be a commercial during their so called liberal conservative talk show this book was so mind numbingly uhdull and as faux as colmes himself he oughtta banish himself for such buffonry 
revisionism sheila fitzpatrick has written that the total number of those murdered by the soviets is in the low hundreds of thousands in other words she is a crank there are numerous books out debunking fitzpatrick and her fellow apologists for lenin and the bolsheviks yale university s annals of communism series is a good place to start in denial historians communism espionage by john earl haynes and harvey klehr is an excellent read on how fitzpatrick and other academics distort facts and lie through omission to cover up the atrocities of lenin zinoviev radek trotsky stalin et al fifteen years ago fitzpatrick s apologies for a regime which murdered over million of its own citizens could have been weakly defended now that the soviet archives have been opened and we have testimony from those involved in the regime her book is simply inexusable read a century of violence in soviet russia by alexander n yakovlev and anthony austin yakovlev was the architect of perestroika he was a communist he had access to documents western researchers have not yet seen yakovlev details how the regime was a criminal organization from its founding it never had the support fitzpatrick claims it did 
no help at all this book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money page principles of long term investing chapter shows that among the s p index returns large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks now look at chapter of the largest corporations only exxon mobile and citigroup are value stocks duuhhh now i know what to do i have a choice of two stocks if you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart if you know little it won t add to your knowledge at all 
worthless this book is another attempt to capitalize on a name brand porter harvard as opposed to providing a substantive insightful take on what is happening in japan and what needs to be done in order to correct certain problems in the japanese economy it also gives the false impression that japan is somehow a pre mature version of the us porter is not a japan expert and i would be very careful as an american foreigner to not to take books on japan by foreigners who have never lived their or speak the language too seriously the book is not about japan it is a generalized theoretical black box solution to a much more complex problem in which one needs to understand a lot more than just management theory japanese management is much more complex and unlike in the us where a monkey can be trained to fire people japanese managers have many more issues to deal with people tend to forget the fact that japanese managers have done a much better job though moving more slowly at reducing the negative impact of restructuring its more difficult to keep a company going and competitive when its against the law to fire people than if you could fire people on the spot us management quotexpertisequot is incredibly over rated the recent market correction shows the incredible amount of resources that are wasted by corporate america on such things as management consulting those foreigners who have written on japan s economy and financial markets who have the language down speaking reading and have been in country for an extended period of time as expats can provide a very interesting and highly useful perspective for those looking from the outside in a way most japanese cannot and will not being a quotsenior advisor quot to a few large japanese companies does not qualify someone to write on this topic 
disappointing mclaren s critique of the church in the modern age paints a scathing picture but doesn t refer to any leaders by name his perspective seems distorted to me but i cannot tell who he has in mind because he doesn t cite any particular modern church writings of most concern to me is that mclaren s strategies seem to lack biblical support culture seems to be the guiding force behind his strategies but he is working from his own projection of the direction of western culture in the future if mclaren s projection is off then his strategies will be irrelevant at best 
no no no oh dear this is a really poor book and i d advise you to save your money and buy something else bourgs first book on game development on phyiscs suffered poor reviews for being shallow not presenting real world techniques and glossing over huge gaping problems in his approach this book has all the same problems and even more strongly in places firstly he makes a big point of saying that the book is aimed at novice developers and he will cover only a few techniques designed to get you up and running in his list however he has genetic algorithms neural networks and production systems all of which large ai teams for major developers find it very hard to get working usefully eg finding an application suited for a ga in a game is just about impossible his approaches are in places laughable secondly he then lauds completely inappropriate algorithms his steering system is based on potential functions for example and he proposes this because he says it allows you to mix several different movement concerns this is completely disingenuous to his readers the technique is very simple and useful only when several concerns are not blended together when you mix things you always get wells ofattraction and your characters get stuck hopelessly just about any other technique would improve on this and there s no use just saying do pathfinding either there s much more mileage in steering algorithms and the final thing that annoyed me was his approach all the way along of saying im only going to show you a few techniques trying to make the selling point of the book that it doesn t cover anywhere near enough ground to get your ai up and running just about every chapter had significant problems in it his knowledge of the subject wouldn t pass a sophomore ai exam ive taught ai courses at university i m not exaggerating it is full of innaccuracies eg he says new ai is non deterministic while old ai is deterministic a moronic comment if you are a novice trying to get going in ai this book will seriously harm you development try john funge s new book or the new morgan kauffman book youll have to wait a few months even reaching through the two ai programming wisdom will see you far better prepared for real development despite the odd lemon of an article in them

biblical creation attempts to be a science morris believes that the bible can be scientifically proven this is impossible since the bible is a religious text it is an interesting read but keep in mind that morris uses bad science and fallacy after fallacy to make his religion look scientific 
becky irritate my nervous this book is a over rated this is the story of becky who was such a pathological liar with a relatively small mind she lied about everything small and big important and unimportant good or bad so to speak attempting to make everyone happy in her small and selfish ways or for her own selfish reasons coming from a loving good family with great education why she was so absurdly and senselessly stupid and dump is really beyond anyone with a minim dose of common sense can understand except for those who think in the same way wonder what a sheltered life can do to one s life may be someone should write a book title as how to tell the truth in daily life or call it how to tell the truth the interesting characters who worth my sympathy is the wedding planer and becky s mother i had hard time to finish the book because i was out of patience with becky less half way through the book it is entertaining sometime but most of the time becky just irritate my nerve

poor quality high price i am sure the movie will be great but this companion screenplay is quite lackluster with such beautiful imagery you would think the book would be bursting with wonderful shots not the case small book small blurry images little or no designs making of publicity shots etc save your money oh well 
shows the weakness of the catholic church amy welborn has written a kind of book that i find hard to believe exists at all a book written specifically in reaction to another book with the intention of debunking it the funny thing is that other book is a fiction thriller novel anyone else find this odd catholic apologists have been bashing dan brown s peculiarly popular davinci code for the past few years apparently because their faith is threatened by it it escapes me why any devout catholic or any christian for that matter would feel the least bit unnerved by a fiction novel but since several books have been written in attempt to destroy the davinci code i must comment on them i found the davinci code to be a slick fast paced thriller which uses catholic themes and history to drive a fictional yes fictional tale of murder codes art etc little did i know when i read the book that some people would be so affected by it that they would go on to write books of their own leeching off of dan brown s success and generally using the old but i heard that approach to debate and of course failing miserably the fact that a number of books have been published that basically attack dan brown s work is distressing the same way that michael moore is distressing i m no fan of widely published personal attacks on others in this case catholics are writing to defend their faith like holy crusaders against a fiction novel which has been bolstered in popularity not weakened by the church s jihad against it this shows a prime weakness of the chuch they use their book the bible and subsequent liturgy to bash someone else s book i love a good argument but welborn s book and the other attacks on davinci code is a classic im right because my beliefs and my church say i am this is the truth don t believe that other guy ploy the obvious spectacular degree of arrogance shown here only furthers the divide between rational readers like those who read the davinci code and enjoyed it because it was a fun fiction thriller and nothing more and those who would go out of their way to make a huge crying fit over a novel that happens to use the church as the basis for fiction dont waste your time with a book like de coding da vinci it s a subjective assault on a popular novel a book intended to encourage catholics and others that have been swept up on the controversy surrounding davinci code to bash the book every chance they get as opposed to simply accepting its popularity and not believing its fiction if they don t wish to of course not everything in the davinci code is true everyone else seems to understand this there is no need to write a book about it unless one s own insecurity about their personal faith and religion is so complete that it becomes necessary in that case be my guest 
disappointed pace was ploddingly slow through the first chapters characters weren t engaging enough to warrant finishing this book 
then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many matt let me just say i respect the noi and it s leaders particulary mister farrakhan however the doctrine they are following is false many former christians and non christians have been led astray by a religion that is supposedly the black man s religion and the false pretense that allah and jehovah are the same god however just because something caters to a particular ethnic group doesn t mean it s right liquor stores in black low income neighborhoods in addition if the god of islam is the same god of christianity then their messages shouldn t contradict each other ! the bible was written thousands of years before message to the black man if elijah mohammed quotes the bible which he does many times in this book to prove his teachings then that means the bible has precedecence because it is the older source therefore if anything elijah mohammed says contradicts the bible farrad mohammed was the messiah who came in you have to reject elijah mohammed the latter source judge christianity by jesus the christ not so called hypocritical christian leaders from slavery times and beyond if your tires go flat you fix not buy another car let s fix the christian church so we all black white red can go to heaven 
theocratic trash leon r kass m d p hd is chairman of the president george w bush s council on bioethics this book was intelligently written without any reference to religion but the whole underlying message was do not touch gods property even if it means healing the sick these religious fundamentalists will do anything to stunt us in our pursuits of happiness this guy is for keeping paralyzed people paralyzed dr kass is for keeping amputees amputated he s for keeping the depressed and suicidal depressed and suicidal ill spare you the bull and say what dr kass really wants to say i want you to follow jesus with all your heart no matter how much pain and suffering you are in if god made you depressed than thats how you should be if god made you paralyzed then thats how you should be if you are miserable in your existance then thats obviously how god wants you to be and thats how you will be with our new conservative laws that will effectively ban progress to help people for this is the only real argument you can use to support the banning of progress designed to help humans he wants everyone to follow the divine rule of sanctity of life not quality of life an ugly ethic for a very stupid man 
you ll hate the characters this book did not live up to its hype it tries to do for guenevere what mists of avalon did for morgan le fey but it fails sorely because the title character is an embittered shrew the plot repeats itself endlessly over the course of three novels guenevere loves arthur she hates arthur she forgives arthur she loves arthur again no wait she hates him arthur by the way is a weak feeble minded doddering simpleton this is not the great king of arthurian legend at all lancelot is still a tasty dish but there is no apparent reason why he would love a bitter jealous middle aged woman who repeatedly casts him away morgan le fey starts out as a promising character but becomes a demonic harpy type creature and the tone is excessively anti christian i m not a religious person at all but even i was offended by the way christians are depicted in this novel it s just not a pleasant read if you want a great trilogy told from guenevere s point of view read persia woolley s guenevere trilogy or nancy mckenzie s queen of camelot they re well worth the time and effort 
learned but dull this densely written book gives the patient reader a few of the same insights that one can get from a good chumash torah w commentary such as the artscroll chumash or the conservatives etz chaim so i would not say it is completely worthless the difference is that a chumash is pithier and more clearly written than this book when i read the torah portion every week i sometimes can t put it down especially in genesis by contrast i found it impossible to keep plowing through this learned but dull dull dull tome 
based on incorrect facts this is the first time i ve given a book the minimum rating i bought this book in the hope that it would help me consider whether the purpose driven life church is more secular philosophy influencing church beliefs than the church bringing god s revelation to the world however it quickly became apparent that the basis of this book is fundamentally flawed as the author gets many basic facts wrong the problems can best be illustrated by looking at appendix a where the author contrasts psychology with the bible i ll describe the errors as they apply to jungian psychology as this is one of the main targets for the author in the book and is something of which i have some knowledge example errors fear of the lordpoint of the appendix says psychology counsels no fear of the lord at anytime with the bible teaching that the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom yet carl jung wrote it is quite right therefore that the fear of god should be considered the beginning of all wisdom both are justified the fear of god as well as the love of god completed works volume p jung and atheismpoint of the appendix says most founding fathers were atheists or humanists including jung in fact carl jung famously asserted his absolute knowledge of god s existence in a bbc documentary made shortly before he died the atheist richard dawkins described jung as believing in a probability of god the god delusion p body mind soul personality and spiritpoint of the appendix declares that psychology does not acknowledge the spirit in man yet carl jung s writings are packed with discussion of the spirit just in case you think that by spirit he really meant mind jung wrote spirit like god cannot be proved to exist in the external world and cannot be understood rationally cw p this clearly distinguishes spirit from mind bodypersonality all of which can be studied scientifically rationally eternal hopepoint of the appendix contrasts psychology as offering no hope for eternity with the bible that teaches us about our eternal destiny but jung s view was that eternityis the prerogative of the one god cw p the holy spiritpoint of the appendix declares psychology doesn t even believe in the holy spirit in contrast jung wrote the paraclete ie holy spirit is of the greatest significance cw p and since the holy ghost is the third person of the trinity and god is present entire in each of the three persons at any time the indwelling of the holy ghost means nothing less than an approximation of the believer to the status of god s son cw p the author goes on to make points of comparison between psychology and scripture and in regards jungian psychology i take issue with most of them please don t misunderstand me i m not saying that jung s views should be taken uncritically by any means he says many things that are highly controversial but this book is based on straw man arguments the spirit in which it is written i felt very uncomfortable with the tone taken in the book towards rick warren his name is used several times on most pages when making points of criticism giving it the feel of a sustained personal attack he is often placed in double binds eg he is criticised for saying that willow creek back his programmes because it is not the lord s backing ! rick warren is also labelled early on in the book as a heretic which is a very serious charge but he is then criticised for statements such as meditation is focused thinking and your personal testimony is more effective than a sermon and faithfulness has always been a rare quality are these really matters of fundamental heresy to which timothy might be relevant they seem to me to be merely disputable matters that fall into the province of romans conclusionthe purpose driven approach has pervaded the church so much that i think there is a need for a book like this to question and challenge what is happening unfortunately whilst this book may contain fine sounding argument it does not contain sound argument because of the many elementary factual mistakes 
a poor imitation of michael crichton iles tries to imitate michael crichton with bits of dan brown s digital fortress in this book unfortunately this book does not make it the nsa is backing a project called trinity which is to develop a super quantum computer that is controlled by a brainscan of a human mind two of the individuals involved with the project want it halted and one dies in an apparent stroke which was actually induced by the nsa bad guys why does the nsa always have to be portrayed as the bad guys in these books david tennant is the other individual and he gets away by stopping an unstoppable hitman and then persuades his psychiatrist to run with him even though she thinks he is mentally unstable the plot really gets out of hand with tennant having visions of being jesus being portrayed to the secret service as the next oswald and escaping the entire washington dc police and swat units and ultimately getting out the country with a false passport going to israel and then persuading the head of the moussad to help him as crazy as it sounds the end is literally unbelievable that would even make a james bond fan cringe the author has written some great tense books hours sleep no more so i just chalk this one up to an experiment gone awry 
in a word generic this is the first book i ve not been able to put down not because it was so riveting but because i couldn t wait to be done with it it reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or perhaps for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city the themes problems and experiences of the stassos family are so completely generic that should the book be interpreted into any visual form it would take the shape of the most heavy handed after school special ever made and as for the poetic prose that is attributed to this novel the use of language is over thetop and often pretencious many experiences are not simply stated but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning one example that i underlined im always careful ben said in exactly the spirit he would toss a too small offering a hibiscus blossom a pomegranate into a crater what granted the context is missing but even in the context this quote made me laugh and by the time i came to the last third of book the laughter was all that got me though to the end that and the fact that i had to finish it because i told someone that i would if i could give this book less than one star i would 
laughable this book will tell you nothing about quothistoryquot it reads more like a novel and uses a series of literary devices which do violence to the material it deals with human history is not a story why should it be it doesn t have an quotauthorquot real rubbish 
this book is out of date i don t know why amazon is still pushing the rd edition months after the release of the th edition which is much superior ! the th edition is available on amazon as well but you have to look elsewhere for the large print walmart online has it 
for jabber s sake what a disappointment china mieville s first two novels set in the world of bas lag gave him a well deserved reputation as the most important young writer working in the sci fi fantasy genres today in perdido street station and the scar mieville created a neo dickensian milieu of bizarre terrible but deeply compelling grotequeries inhabited by complex often conflicted characters both narratives gained momentum over hundreds of pages even as each sprawled further into and then away from the teeming city of new crubozon and all of it was illuminated by mieville s powerfully intelligent pleasingly baroque prose style so what happened with iron council mieville s third bas lag book is confusing meandering and populated by shallow underdeveloped highly unlikeable characters his writing style is choppy throughout and routinely defies the most basic rules of grammar and usage perhaps he was aiming for profundity think david foster wallace but he achieved only preciousness at best and tedium more often the narrative such as it was given his penchant herein for flashbacks deus ex machinas and withheld information had holes in it one could pardon the pun drive a train through the plot progressed as if he didn t know where it was going when he was writing it above all iron council was agonizingly dull i could hardly wait for the book to be over with and finished many have correctly noted that this is mieville s most explicitly political novel since his politics are euro socialist in character perhaps you might think i was put off by that but no i am myself that rara avis an american social democrat of long standing and i have little but sympathy for tales of community level collectives a la the paris commune or worker oppression a la the transcontinental railroad and both themes and their thinly veiled historical antecedents are prominent in iron council but largely because of mieville s failure to draw fuller more sympathetic characters cutter is a whiny jackass judah low is a cipher or to sustain a believable and interesting narrative the council itself is an irritating community prone to sudden inexplicable shifts of opinion as to its raison d etrebut never mind as it doesn t finally appear until hundreds of pointless pages have passed following the interminable wanderings of cutter co and the similarly unlikeable ori back in new crobuzon and with it all undermined by his annoying staccato voice and sometimes incoherent descriptions of events whatever merits mieville s radically politicized story may have had get thoroughly lost in the shuffle in his previous novels nothing felt like a set piece everything that happened usually played a crucial role in why subsequent events turned out as they did in iron council by contrast one senses more a rote succession of staged novelty acts as if mieville were making use of every half developed idea he d ever had take the attack of the inchmen for one instance in a similar vein the major characters in his earlier bas lag were sometimes morally ambiguous but that just made them consistently interesting and complicated as many have commented the most noteworthy thing about two of the major characters in iron council is their homo or bisexuality and yet while this is a promising and perhaps vaguely daring premise in the usually hyper heterosexual world of fantasy fiction it seems a choice made more for shock effect than anything essential to them or the plot their sexuality is clearly intended to be but is very poorly realized as vital to these characters beingness and thus it contributes almost nothing to our understanding of them in fact cutter s passionate possessiveness toward low makes him seem more than anything one dimensional and frequently grating hence cutter s sexuality becomes more of a negative trait which seems rather incongruous with mieville s anti intolerance politics spoiler alert just a few plot objections concerning the end of the book though there were plenty of others throughout why wouldn t the militia have destroyed or booby trapped the tracks just outside of new crobuzon why hadn t they sought out and found their cohorts and the council in the weeks prior to the train s approach just as cutter had why can t any of the refugees from the city give the council a reasonably straight answer as to whether or not the collective had already been vanquished it had and most of all how does the time golem manage to continue in existence even after judah low has been killed finally and in a completely different vein why does mieville use the word career as a verb over and over again but enough already i have never before had my expectations so shattered by an author i am astounded that anyone would think that this book is on a par with or even better than mievilles previous bas lag novels though the wider consensus seems to be one of disappointment more or less unfortunately though mieville received some of the best and widest mainsteam media reviews of his career with iron council and if he believes his clippings i m afraid we may in for more outings like this but his earlier works provide a far better indication of his prodigious talents and so i will fervently hope that he can still return to that form with his next novel 
save your money poorly done character work provides no insight into this weakly timed and tasteless rendition of a low caliber shot in the dark at a horror novel no scene work outside of the beast house implies that this author is grinding out a novel with the intent to write a second or third in a series of books about cheap sex gore beasitality and pediphilia intent on making the reader retch this book would banned from some web sites and the nanny guards would block it from most computers three hundred and nine pages could have been shrunk to about one hundred considering the large print oversized margins and full blank pages between chapters publishers at leisure fiction should have reconsidered printing this one save your money and buy a book that is properly labeled as adult porn at least you will know what you are getting 
like a comic book with no pictures but fun i guess in need of a fun adventure read i picked up an author i always seem to see on the shelves cussler it was a fun easy read but i expected better from such a prolific author this is a book i would have loved when i was years old but have now come to a be a bit more demanding of realism i found the syntax and grammar of the narrator to be very poor which detracted from the book tremendously i was left wondering if the editor just rubber stamped this one my main issue with this book was the sci fi level of belief suspension needed to get through it spoilers fully functioning artificial intelligence robots able to carry out casual conversations circa japan has secretly created a perfect missile defense program an adventurer underwater researcher sent in to take down a heavily defended fortress instead of a trained team of seals deltaetc that a japanese tycoon created over nukes from one salvaged fat man atomic bomb from that a super secure vault would have a convenient ventillation duct large enough for a man to squeeze through robots that drive cars several ridiculously convenient coincidences that save the day the usual near death witty comment etc all in all kind of fun but don t think much or you ll ruin the plot 
boring did not care for this book it was a struggle to get to the last pages which read somewhat more interesting but was not worth it don t waste your time you never care for the characters nor did i want to get to know them 
same old stuff in a time of heady progress in biochemistry and pharmacology along comes a clinician to tell us once again that addiction is a state of mind that can be cured by correcting skewed thought patterns in fact the neuroplasticity of the brain responds to addictive drugs by altering the function of existing neuropathways addicted people are different from normal people by virtue of dysfunctions along the serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine quotpleasure pathways quot the attitudes expressed in this book are at least years out of date and likely to be of limited use to anyone attempting to free themselves from addiction 
don t buy this for the art the previous reviews gave me the impression there would be great concept art in this book instead the few artworks are completing lacking in imagination technical skill and the disney design feel the artworks have a s look about them with psychodelic pastel rainbow streaks smeared across what would otherwise be dull sketches take away the colour and the line art is woeful this guy cannot even draw a decent mickey mouse a half talented year old could do better the best visuals herein are the photos of the theme park don t waste your money on this guy like disney did 
lacking in details and intimancies i ll be the first to admit that i m biased based on my expectations from shaara s father s great book the killer angels it is not fair to compare the two but because reading the father s book lead me to buy this one i thought i should mention it this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father s book it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle but the result is a less satisfying book it skims rather than digs deep

too verbose the insights jean liedloff gained while spending more than two years living in the jungle with stone age indians are fascinating if you can discern them through her diffuse writing style it s a really difficult book to get through because of the author s why use five words when twenty five will do writing style i opened my copy to a random page and found one sentence with words it s dense stuff the good news is that the wonderful book our babies ourselves by meredith small has many of the same ideas but is a much more pleasant read 
warning bobke triple regurgitation fraud i am a big fan of bob roll ever since watching him face plant in a norba race at big bear after enjoying his column in velo news i bought bobke when it was published amusing read when we got back from france in a tdf frenzy i ordered his tour primer and thought my wife might enjoy more stories so i ordered bobke ii i didn t mind re reading his columns in b i but to be sold the same stories twice with minimal value add was insulting the few new bits have such a speculative orientation i am sure this book will become instantly dated if you do not own the original bobke and discovered bob on oln perhaps bobke ii is of value i just feel ripped off and ignorant for having been taken this way i still love bob and hope he has continuing success oln s coverage would suffer without his knowledge and funk 
stop this is a must not read you really need to be careful when reading this book understandingly people facing the challenges of add adhd are stressed out and overly receptive to a voice like hartmann s strangely unprofessional hartmann offers a soft ball lob to those looking for a feel good camp firelike discussion of the challenges of add adhd this is not a productive way to approach these challenges overcoming these challenges takes discipline a manner of thinking totally absent in harmann s writing i would go so far as to say that the author s writing style the manner in which he presents his ideas and the thinking behind those ideas represents the worst rather than the most optimal aspects of traits associated with add beware

not sure who the intended audience is i have an extensive math background and found this book tough to read not because the math described is particularly complicated it is most definitely not high school algebra is sufficient but because ross writing style is too verbose of readers should know the meaning of average yet ross devotes a lot of text to explaining this concept i m not sure who his audience is math savvy people may feel that concepts have been dumbed down and over explained but math phobic people may be scared off by the use of formulas and the majority of times they aren t really needed anway 
dark victory america s second war against iraq in record a former senate armed services committee staff member authored hollow victory a contrary view of the gulf war in which he took president george h w bush to task for not ousting saddam hussein in the present book record takes george w bush to task for having corrected his father s mistake the new book while well written is reduced by the author s permeating antipathy for so called neoconservatives alleging without proof that a sympathy for israel s likud party colors their view of the world while it is true that neoconservatives tend to be staunch supporters of israel every president since harry truman has defended israel s right to exist and to defend itself nor is there anything new about u s support for democracy or opposition to terror the only recent development is a willingness of the u s government to reach out to new partners even if this means working without traditional allies record further blames neoconservatives for the president s controversial use offorce doctrine curiously overlooking the impact of on bush s thinking record holds neoconservatives responsible for pursuing policies that cause many adversaries to dislike the united states he laments the bush administration s foreign policy fails to grasp the fact that others do not see us as we see ourselves that is as a benign and historically exceptional force but the bush administration does grasp this it just believes that being respected is more important than being liked the costs of winning syrian north korean or chinese favor for u s policy would be too high if it meant abandonment of democracies such as israel south korea and taiwan conversely libyan strongman mu ammar al qadhafi may not like the united states but it was his respect for the bush administration s willingness to back force with military action that led to his decision to abandon his nuclear ambitions records style is confident and authoritative with plenty of facts cited and examples given a close read though shows that record ignores facts that undermine his arguments for example he trumpets a unicef report that relied on iraqi government statistics to conclude that sanctions on iraq killed iraqi children he ignores a joint food and agriculture organization and world health organization study the following year that found that half the iraqi population was overweight and that hypertension and diabetes not diseases of the hungry were among the leading causes of iraqi mortality other facts he simply gets wrong how could the defense department have airlifted ahmad chalabi into iraq during military operations when chalabi had returned to kurdish controlled northern iraq months before the war began dark victory has many other weaknesses record engages in one mansterroristisanotherspatriot moral relativism he conflates the afghan mujahideen with al qaeda an anachronism that ignores a decade long fight between al qaeda pan islamists and afghan nationalists such as ahmad shah masud while determined to debunk any analogy between postwar japan and iraq record ignores the south korea example frequently cited by deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz notably absent from a book about iraq is any consideration of what iraqis think record writes as if iraqis do not exist a book should be more than a glorified op ed unfortunately dark victory is not middle east quarterly spring

houston we have a problem i gave this book two stars because i admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one one must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when fw was presented to a publisher if not for these factors it would have gotten one star please don t be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can t understand it instead rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story made you want to read the next page and perhaps in the end changed your view of the world

this book was sometimes interesting but the plethora of percentages and numbers weigh it down the views of the author were one sided and sometimes a little biased agaisnt the majority this is a small quibble and does not really take away from the main message the author is trying to convey this book is however quite an eye opener especially for those who believe that in this country all men are created equal this book proves that it simply isn t so

good on theory weak on practical aspects the book presents translation theory and information on the history of translation it lists proverbs with their translations as well as cognates and false cognates there s humorous examples of bad translations therefore after reading it you will know how to evaluate the quality of a translation without having been given much practice in translating if you re looking for a book on translation theory this will be a fine introduction it isn t as good if you need to learn to translate 
angry judgmental words the tone of the book starts off seemingly angry cynical and sarcastic for these reasons i may not be inclined to recommend this book to anyone who is not one hundred percent passionate about having a natural homebirth i found the first half of this book to be abrasive at times and repetitive it seems that ms wildner feels the need to convince her audience to see things her way and if they don t then they are at fault the wording in the book does not seem to leave much room to allow women to choose what is right and comfortable for them unless it is a drug free intervention free homebirth the book at times is very judgmental of women s lifestyles and choices that do not conform to the author s viewpoints i feel that the tone of this book may turn women away and they will not benefit from the very useful information found in the latter chapters mother s intention seems to be full of contradictions ms wildner seems to be trying to convince women that childbirth is not naturally painful but that they have just been conditioned to believe that it is and therefore they feel it she uses the reasoning that women are told by the bible that it is eves curse so they are programmed to think that god made childbirth painful and so it is she then goes on to say that women who are not christians are not effected by that but also have painful births i personally feel that pain is an important part of the birthing process learning methods to cope with the pain and work with your body to birth your baby is an empowering event the experience can transform a woman into a warrior that is ready and able to confront and work through any situation life has to offer i also feel that the pain is a link to the awareness and consciousness of the event and the child in my opinion ms wildner did not emphasize this very important element of birth but discounted it by implying that birth should be naturally pain free and if it is not then you are not doing it the right way once you read past the repetitive attempt at convincing you to believe that birth is painless and only natural homebirth is the correct way this book has a lot to offer the information on how intervention can lead the birthing process down a road to unnecessary cesarean is a message all women need to hear knowing that they do have a choice and having labor support can help them to have the birth they intent is also a valuable message i would however recommend a more objective book like the thinking woman s guide to a better birth by henci goer instead 
just plain dumb i am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book i guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans but i just don t see what was great or even good about this story two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people they are caught they confess and the grandmother of one of the killers hires spenser to prove the boy s innocense we are given the impression a great mystery with possible red herrings is about to entertain us alas it is not to be the kids did it plain and simple why they did it is so stupid the story reads as though a sixth grader has written it the plot is lame and even as lame as it is it isn t executed well at all the characters are boring and dimensional the banter which takes place between the main character and others while it seems to be trying to be witty is just dumb and unbelievable i just can t say enough about how stupid this story is there are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one this is the first novel i have read by this author and will most definitely be my last 
flyboys i had a difficult time with this book having ready flags of our fathers i had hopes this would be as well written and informitive however from early on this book came across as just another piece of pagan liberal propoganda the ethnic cleansing of american indians by the united states was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there the pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the united states does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions this book is another pagan apologetic for what s wrong with the us and right with all nations who wish us ill 
the law of sex an violence if it bleeds it leads too bad if it bleeds it leads sensationalism at its worst painful novel to read but forced myself to finish yuck have heritage and have studied history of this era and region from the best of harvard professors this fiction was filled with far too much blood and sex not a good read actually somewhat insulting for those with irish background 
i don t agree with the other reviewers i was not convinced having tried mr x it had such a must have look about it and found it seriously wanting again the main character is not persuasive enough he actually sounds like a complete jerk maybe it would have been more convincing written in third person but as is not as bad as mr x which was a total dissapointment but definititely much ado about very little 
worst of all laymon s novels i ve read about of laymon s novels and they were always at least entertaining but this book goes so far into the ridiculous that it didn t even pass as entertainment the characters are just too stupid to believe at one point the main heroine a y o school teacher is nearly raped and runs into a fast food bathroom instead of calling the cops because she s embarrassed to tell anyone her boyfriend has gone missing when he went out to buy condoms no kidding there s another scene were two teenage boys find what they believe is a dead woman s body and instead of calling the police have a ten minute debate over whether to call for help or rape the dead body this might be mildly amusing if it were meant to be over the top tongue in cheek horror but laymon s playing this straight not only the worst of his books but one of the worst books i ve ever endured 
not that well written i usually really hate to critize a book like this but this book was not what i expected it to be this book was to be romantic suspense but where was the romance this book focused mainly on the mystery which was solved by the the time you reached the middle of the book and then the story kinda dragged on probably to finish the love story the love story was okay but there was no serious focus on it and it just kinda closed off in the end for my first book by krentz it was not the greatest 
a big disappointment unfortunately the book didn t uncover any secrets whatsoever as the title alludes to the information contained in this book is very basic i found one major problem with the text in that it encourages component depreciation my research and understanding is that this was clearly outlawed in the us in the s when i contacted the publishing company for clarification no one would answer this simple question if this book was filled with high quality ideas i would have overlooked an error or two and given this book or stars but that wasn t the case as i ve only been in the real estate game for a short time and already knew most of what is contained in this text all in this book isn t even worth the shipping i paid for it used 
a broad book but lacking in details the book covers a broad range of problems in machine design but lacks clear explanations and citations often times in sample problems the author s solution skips crucial steps or fails to cite information the section on fasteners is lacking as well it neglects to mention counterfeit fasteners and their implications in recent years it also does not mention an or nas fasteners too many coeficients are taken blindy from charts which are not cited this makes the problems in the book little more than blind plug chug type problems one might expect this from a first or second edition high school book but not a fourth edition college text 
who is really writing these i ll be honest the last three novels have me thinking that patricia cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name the voice the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels and its very frustrating leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she d been attacked by the pod people or something i hold firm to the idea that she hasn t been writing these novels there is just no way 
wow how did this ever get published this is just a really bad book first i blame james patterson but i really really blame his editor what editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published the villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains just over the top the plot line is unbelievable aside from alex cross and the two villains nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever alex cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the fbi to foil the villains this is supposed to be one of those the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world type thriller but there s no sense of urgency and the law enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched and inept but not deliberately written that way i could go on and on but it s not worth the words this book is really a waste of time i can t believe anybody published it 
if you must read it borrow it from the library i just had a hard time reading understandingfinishing this book i did finally finish it because i wanted to know the mystery behind the author s father but in the end the whole book was disappointing i guess it s a matter of the book s structure the author jumps from one time setting to another so often it gets totally confusing ! also she intertwines different stories of different family members and other people in her life that it s easy to confuse the characters some of the language sounds awkward the curse words seem forced also after a while the author s unceasing bitterness towards life tended to grate on my nerves 
a popularity contest for ideas shermer s book is an attempt to classify various lines of research into science nonscience and borderlands science but he follows no rigorous methodology instead he subjectively classifies various theories practices and lines of research into his three categories based upon how popular certain theories are among mainstream scientists and how much the theories practices and lines of research appeal to his narrow scientific fundamentalism there really is no need for this book the celebrated philosopher karl popper brilliantly solved the problem of the demarcation between science and philosophy ideology and nonsense decades ago and his work has been endorsed by scientists from einstein to hawkings the criterion is testability scientific theories are theories that are capable of being tested by experiment or observation our theories can never be proven correct although a single counter instance can prove them wrong one can sum up popper s famous demarcation between science and non science by saying that the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability accordingly theories that are not falsifiable in principle cannot claim to be scientific and so belong to metaphysics ideology or pseudo sciencepoppers criterion of testability provides a clear logical way of separating science from ideology and philosophy hence string theory is not science but philosophy as it currently makes no predictions capable of being tested popper argued that marxism started out as a scientific theory it predicted that capitalism would lead to increasing misery among the masses and then be overthrown by revolution and replaced by socialism it also predicted that this would occur first in the most technically developed countries when the so called worker s revolution first occurred in then backward and agrarian russia supporters of the theory did not accept this as a refutation the theory was simply modified so that it became immune to falsification in other words marxism was transformed into an ideology the universal property of scientific theories cannot be stressed enough a scientific theory cannot be merely speculation about a particular fact or an isolated event because nothing new and non trivial can be predicted from such a speculation this point has to be stressed because it has caused a great deal of confusion among philosophers and historians of science for example shermer writes in the book poppers attempt to solve the problem of demarcation between science and nonscience begins to break down in the borderlands of knowledge consider the theory that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos if we find out by making radio contact through the seti program then the theory will have been proven absolutely but how could this theory ever be falsified shermers mistake is his categorization of the statement extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos as a scientific theory it is no such thing it is merely speculation about a specific fact from which no non trivial predictions follow for instance it does not follow from this that such life would want to contact us would share our values would be friendly toward us and so forth it is no more a scientific theory than the statement there are white swans somewhere on the lake such statements about specific factual matters can indeed be confirmed even proven beyond all reasonable doubt but this is only because they are not universal statements scientific theories are universal statements about how facts fit together and from such universal statements follow predictions about specific facts so from the universal statement all swans are white follows the prediction that the next swans we will see on the lake will be white the former is a simple scientific theory the latter a prediction about a specific fact that follows from the theory and that may used to test the theory note that shermer would have formulated his idea as a scientific theory if he had stated it in a universal testable form such as life arises quickly wherever there is water and an average temperature above freezing and given a few billion years some of this life will become recognizably intelligent this is a universal statement that relates specific facts to each other can be used to make predictions about how much intelligent life exists elsewhere in our galaxy and can be tested at least in principle by sending probes to planets in which conditions for life appear to have been appropriate for a few billion years if intelligent life is not found then the theory is refuted and must either be abandoned or modified it is precisely at the borderlands of science that popper s criterion works so well parapsychology for instance most certainly is a science to the extent that it makes predictions capable of being tested but shermer gives little attention to this field as it conflicts with his ideology of materialism shermer is not a scientist but an historian and as an historian he has no excuse for being woefully ignorant of the history of science at one time reports that rocks sometimes fall from the sky what we know call meteorites were dismissed by most scientists as superstitious fantasies the idea that the continents could drift was ridiculed for decades even x rays were considered an elaborate hoax those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them and shermer has simply not learned that popularity of ideas cannot be used as a guide to separate science from nonsense but shermer is an intellectual lightweight who is simply out of his league when discussing the philosophy of science if you want to read something really magnificent on the subject i recommend replies to my critics in the philosophy of karl popper part ii edited by paul arthur schilpp 
no student solution manual as a student how can i study without a solution manual is all abstract algebra classes this way i have an awful time to study i m sorry 
oreilly losing quality this book as has been said is a completely different book and not worthy of being called the second edition of such a good book oreilly has dissapointed me for the first time since most oreilly perl books are excellent value and of a high quality instead as in the first edition that covers a good range of advanced topics this book chooses some rare and obscure ones this book is of little use to the programmer whom has ever picked up the cook book or perl programming by same publisher unfortunely for me i did not have the chance to see the book in person or a truthful review 
very poorly written this book is very poorly written there are a number of flash backs that if my teacher hadn t pointed out no one would have that it was a flash back the ending is also terrible only read this book if you have to much time on your hands 
trite tripe this is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published the fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of man woman and the development of societies is indeed sad mcelvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering his imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy i guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the nature of things and put enough of a self loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership that s what happened here don t waste your time a disturbing aspect to this is that he s teaching the next generation of leaders 
sick and sad i was brought up evangelistic christian i was forced every sunday to go into church where some were turned away at a very young age i saw such unjust intolerence for other people and thier belief systems example all who are not born again will go to hell unfortunately it was that attitude that was so common within the church and not the actual teachings and love for christ that turned me away i do not descriminate about the teachings of christ only of the fact that many but not all christians believe all who are not christian will not be welcomed by god i simply cannot and then could not understand why only christians who belonged to the same series of churches could go to heaven and all others were going to burn in hell as a very young person i made up my mind that i could not be apart of an organization with such prejudice and overwhelming and sickening self righeouness i however never abandoned my faith in jesus christs love but decided to learn more about these other religions that in the evangelistic church i was told were evil and wrong upon my research i found that most religions are based on a higher being often called upon different names only because of difference in location and language in wicca there is a god and goddess however they are only represenatives as different sides of a whole in every aspect of life there is a male force and a female force one cannot exist without the other and neither can life wiccans believe that the divine spirit is within everything and all so revere nature and show a great respect to all creatures rocks plants animals and of course human beings they simply show the great spirit or god respect by acknoledging the creation and recreation of all life i do not believe that any one religion is wrong or right i believe that religion is man made and therefore imperfect but i know that one should research the dark and light side of everything before being capable of coming to a real educated decision i would also like to point out that whatever is right for one person may not be for another and vise versa and so it is with ones spirituality now about this book i read this as i have with many books related to neopagan religions all i got from it was a great reminder of why i an no longer affiliated with the evangelists christian church it was quite apparent to me that this book was not researched because i have done my own research this book was very biased and many things that were taken from other books and used as examples were twisted around to reveal something negative when much about wicca is about living life positively please if you do decide to read this book to gain knoledge on wicca dont forget to do further reading on the subject before you make up your mind it is only fair and remember not all wiccans use witchcraft and vice versa also try to remember that everything we see on telivision is not accurate or truthful wiccans and witches are not learking behind trees in dark cloaks waiting for some poor christian to put curses upon and people who claim they are wiccan or witch and commit terrible crimes and murders are just psychopaths and nothing more just as the claimed to be christian cult in wacco texas years ago i would also like to say something to the teens who are interested in wicca if you are searching for a way to get whatever you want without hard work and dedication wicca is not for you if you want to harm others because of injustices done to you wicca is not for you if you want to gain attention by wearing all black and listening to death metal that is not wicca that is called goth style and it does not validate any religion it is just a personal clothing choice and makeup choice ones religion or lifestyle gothic or otherwise does not require one to look any certain way in my opinion one does not need to alter thier appearance to be who i am in my opinion that is exactly the opposite of being who you are use your personality open communication and intelligence to throw out a better signal of who you are of couse feel free to have fun with the way you look if you so choose and for christians one cannot ever be fully knoledgeable about anything a few hundred years ago we knew the world was flat in order to become wise one never stops learning and thus does not stop with learning about the spirituality your family forced upon you at birth it continues with the unbiased research of other religions do not only read about other religions through the authors of christian writers that would be stupid would you learn anything about politics in a cookbook if of course you do not want to delve into another belief system and actually learn what it is about then please do not descriminate against the people whom follow another belief system that would be like a child insisting that he she does not like yams without actually tasting them first edited to limit any confusion my first statement about goth may have inflicted upon some 
torrid and frustrating i generally really like well researched historical fiction and have been a big fan of dorothy dunnett and philippa gregory though the latter takes a lot of liberties with history i was quite drawn into this book from the first sentence and found the description of life on the manor rich and convincing butbegan to switch off around the time we discover jacob cullen is possessed haunted by a voice that encouraged him to brutally kill a young boy and then rape his new bride jacob ends up in the new model army where he forms an intense relationship with ferris who is a naturally good man the descriptions of the war and the brutality are vivid and detailed after they get back to london ferris becomes obsessed with forming a common plot for diggers and he and jacob form an intense homosexual romance at that point and for the rest of the book everything was rather overheated and lusty it seemed like every other page was a description of longing for the embrace or the sweetness between their legs etc i would have been equally bored if this had been a heterosexual couple but i couldn t connect this simpering ferris with the earlier ferris and jacob s bouts of violence began to bore me the book ends when they ve been kicked off the common brutally by the neighboring lord with the implication that jacob could have stopped it but just didn t and jacob is on a boat to america crying the voice is silent i feel as though i didn t get it a number of readers here assume the voice is a symptom of jacob s schizophrenia or madness but it s presented in the book as though it really is the devil well which did jacob rape his own brother when he was a teenager as implied in one scene i kind of resented the way the author withheled information from us it s first person narration but the author only conveniently reveals remembers these types of things when for the first pages of the book jacob is presented as well liked and decent it just seemed flashy the book s change in focus and tone felt somewhat ad hoc lots of loose threads with jacob s family ultimately i was disappointed after zooming through the first half i just naturally slowed down and took a week to read the rest by then i was cottoning on that the author was never going to reveal the mysteries that no one plot was going to develop in a satisfying way and that she enjoyed vivid descriptions of violence and sex but not deeper characterizations she can definitely bring a period to life but the characters were ultimately shadowy and the storytelling was disjointed 
king rat the worst of the clavell saga james clavell s king rat is hands down the worst of his asian saga only related to the other four by the main character s possession of a gold ring signet of the clan gordon italics mentioned once on the seventh page any reader of clavell would expect this to have some significance later but the thread never reemerges did the author forget about it carried away by his clearly sophmoric adulation of his hero or did he toss it in at his publisher s request in order to somehow justify this waste of print by weakly connecting it to his better works and what is this shiftless down andout motherless drunkard s son doing with such a treasure anyway surely that would have made a more interesting book of course the matural answer is that clavell is telling his own story what he lived through as a pow he has however forgotten the first rule of freshman exposition just because it happened to you doesn t make it interesting certainly there are traces of the clavell magic despite his always hackneyed prose he is a master storyteller but in this case the threads lead nowhere and peter out where a quick death would be more merciful a large theme is built up around a secret radio but when discovered not once but twice the japanese commander who has been built up as a terrifying menace offers cigarettes to all involved none are tortured jailed or even questioned it is as if he is uncertain as to whether he wants to write the gulag archipelago or catch and settle for hogan s heroes of tv sitcom fame changi makes stalak look the hanoi hilton there is even a corporal schwarz like japanese guard who like his sitcom counterpart has no stomach for war and comes close to saying i know nothing nothing clavell who knows how to spin yarn would be great on a campout and we cannot forget the majestic sweep of his four good books but like the t shirt says i spent nearly four years in a japanese pow camp and all could come up with was this lame book i was going to give the book away but instead chucked into the recycle bin 
all common sense everything in this book is common sense there is really very little to learn from this and it is overpriced 
well not exactly actually i have not read this book and probably won t anytime soon i understand there is more than one side to everything but am totally offened at the response to dr barach from issd the organization helped me tremdously when i first found out i had mpd did i could not find dr barach s response anywhere on here but i would think that in defending the organization the dr is also defending those of us who have a legitimate diagnosis of mpd did 
ridiculous climax i listened to this on cd in my car driving around western virginia the author is not a very good reader her rhythm intonation is off but i didn t mind the flubs at all it s nice to have a reader that sounds like a real person and by having her read it the we avoid the distraction of having the technical terms being pronounced incorrectly although i m not used to hearing hooves rhyming with moves its a matter of taste but talking animals or babies for that matter have no appeal whatsoever for me ugh ! and if they did talk no horse that i ve ever ridden would have said are you all right when i fell off i believe they d say aaaaaaaaahat last hey there s some grass ! being a woman of a certain age i liked the sister character although i don t believe she still had her figure at but the denouement and sister s actions in it was utterly improbable and illogical gimme a break 
avoid at all costs this is by far the worst action adventure book i have ever read i m surprised that aliens didn t show up at the end to fight against everybody else how this book ever got a top review is beyond me please do not waist your tim 
not impressed eileen barker seems to spend most of this book apologising for the cult s behavior and practices and every turn rather than telling parents what they can do to help their troubled children barker should have spent more time listening to former members and less time talking to the cult leaders 
making meaning how successful business deliver meaningful customer experiences i skimmed through the book and found it to be of little meaning there did not appear to be any substance to it i sent it back for refund i have never returned a book before this one i am not sure why this book was published try again 
tedious reading in the beginning this book seemed to have potential it told of the direct msonic influence present in the foundation of the untied states this was the preface afterwards the book endlessly drags on with dates times people and places everything except what i expected a testimony of how freemasonry affected the establishment of the usa if you are interested in reading a book that reads like a high school text book but really goes no deeper if you are interested in when but not why maybe you will enjoy but i doubt it 
little powerful thoughts lots of non sense there are about power thoughts in this cd book and rest are unpractical nonsense nonsense like i love every cell of my body let the universe s solution come to you i am decisive in my decisions if i make a poor one i ll just make another one i guess if you are completely foolish or just ignorant this book will not help you much your mother probably gave you much more and better advise than this book 
incredible fabrications of history does she know anything about japan s wartime history just google unit the place where her own daddy probably worked at is it a pure coincidence that her daddy lived in the area where these despicable inhuman experiments took place 
erroneous from the very first sentence if the reader knew absolutely nothing about oil production and read this book then he or she would believe his claim that global production of crude oil will decline permanently in the very near future deffeyes takes his cue from price fluctuations and i knowing nothing about petroleum exploration and refining and hearing a lot about peak oil made popular by such conspiratorial tomes as the grand chessboard the party s over and crossing the rubicon keep hearing that little statistician s nagging voice in my head saying could there be some other explanation for the price fluctuations we have seen this sort of thing before folks and we have covered this terrain before whether the subject is the population bomb or the direction of stock prices the drama is always the same someone usually an academic grabs the media spotlight with dire prognostications emanating from his high tech crystal ball typically some mathematical formula or computer model bearing the illusion of precision and predicts doom on the horizon if we do not change course and adopt his typically totalitarian prescription for renewed prosperity unlike the endless parade of kooks past who have predicted the demise of civilization or life as we know it the author s claim to fame is three fold first he has worked in the oil industry and had the good sense to abandon it for academia just before the first oil shock consider the historical performance of the global petroleum industry over the last four decades to see just how sensible that decision was second he is a geologist and tries to impress or rather bore us with an endless recitation of arcane technical information on oil exploration and third the coup de grace he actually worked with the infamous m king hubbert all of these things are supposed to make his pitch both credible and ring true and i guess for those who do not like to think too deeply about things his position really does overflow with truth and credibility since i nor anyone else can not check the data he used to generate the estimates sprinkled liberally throughout the book for their truthfullness that alone sends up red flags in my mind these estimates form the basis for his dire conclusions and the admittedly amateur scientist and statistician in me says that if those estimates are flawed then so too are the conclusions flowing from them in reading this text and others like it i am constantly nagged by the following questions did hubbert predict that all oil production would decline or did he really say something else oddly enough mr hubbert is long dead so much the infamous malthus we can not consult him to hear what he has to say about things could there be another explanation for the u s decline in oil production could that explanation in fact have little or nothing to do with the amount of oil in the ground given that we have some idea of the situation with opec and to some extent the u s with respect to production and consumption what about the situation outside of these two regions such as in the oceans or in the arctic antarticif the oil supply trend globally is on the decline why in the hell are we seeing the trend for fuel economy standards in automobiles on the decline could there be some other explanation for the recent rising trend in oil prices one having perhaps a little something to do with causes firmly rooted in a history of misguided economic and foreign policy the author contends that poor countries will suffer the most under the scenario of world oil shortage because poor countries need energy to run the irrigation pumps necessary to produce food to feed themselves granted fuels from petroleum are one possible energy source but there are others ever hear of natural gas since most of the poor countries also have abundant renewable resources brazil for example has both hydro and solar resources as well as biomass why not use this i strongly suspect but can not prove with any certainty that pricing problems we see today may have something to do with the sort of oil that we could produce versus the kind of oil we would ideally like to use which incidentally opec has a lock on i also suspect that maybe domestic oil production has declined not because of hubbert s peak but rather much like the decline of us domestic forestry it costs less to import the kind of crude we like than it would to produce it domestically in sum this book runs on par with other erroneous apocalyptic tomes that depend on numerical tricks intellectual sleights of hand strangely hidden sources and data sets illusions of precision and rigid certainty such as those produced by bjorn lomborg lester brown and stephen moore readers looking for a bit more insight into the crude oil pricing problem albeit in a historical context would do well to consult robert stobaugh s and daniel yergin s eerily prophetic book energy future 
disappointing unless you re into spamming folks who filter out junk mail anyway you won t find much value in this book each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email spam campaign in order to get recognition and thus advertise to the reader 
master of mixed metaphors don t believe the hype this book is not a masterpiece but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don t quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you ll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in justine it took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book the narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture but what kept me going were durrell s secondary characters he has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in justine are striking emotional and entertaining i am glad that i was able to make it to the end of the novel there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while but i do regret that i recommended this novel to my bookgroup and i do not plan to complete the quartet 
cool idea but not a good book in fact bad book when i bought this book it had a lot of good reviews but it was nothing like what i expected the main charaters at first are good but they develop into wining and annoying people always complaining the book has absolutley no action done by the main charaters no sword fights or any action at all all the main charaters do is run away and complain about having to run i give this book star because the plot had could have become a good book but the charaters are nothing like what you would expect after reading jordan goodkind brooks le guin rowling r r martin nix herbert tolkein and all the other fantasy authors i ve read i hate to tell authors that their book was bad because i know they worked on them extremely hard but i will never read anything else written by this author ian irvine read something else 
unreadable scholarly techno babble this book takes a fascinating subject the lives of gypsies in the usa and reduces it to anthropological formulae and scholarly babble it might be impressive to other anthropologists but it s largely unreadable to mere mortals it s a shame because obviously the author has done some interesting research on a people that are hidden within our midst 
worst sticker book don t buy this book you need to be a surgeon to be able to remove the stickers from the sticker pages you then have to search endlessly with your child to find the proper location for it there are many other more enjoyable options that do not provide as much frustration as this product 
this book is useless this book certainly did not live up to the advertising copy i found on amazon com i found this book to be very poor in terms of usefullness of the contents it was all fluff and appeared to be aimed at best toward management level people who don t have the competence to make factual based decisions on equipment purchases it not only did not provide facts or data it didn t provide many clues about how someone trying to make a decision would go about fact based decision making with respect to edm the text was highly repetitive in nature i found its strong advocacy of relying on the manufacturers of equipment for everything from operations knowledge to purchasing evaluation to be insulting to my inteligence 
i would rate it zero stars not to be disrespectful but are you people for real i can t believe this book is getting and stars there was nothing good about this book a bunch of people in the book did not even matter bill kendall s wife the new anchor man pete whatever his last name was the boss yelena eliza s boyfriend the priest even the soon tobepresident and his wife i mean what s the point in even mentioning them they were not involved in the main events she didn t even talk about what happened to them at the end the judge is the only one that matters and she didn t even write about him all that much really disappointing as i said i don t mean to be disrespectful but to give this book stars you must have read either bedtime stories all your life or not have read anything dont waste your money that s all i have to say sorr 
for children under this book seems to target children under years of age it has very few pointers for adolescents this book tends to be aimed at the education profession rather than parents 
too broad and lacks depth this is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision this book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction unfortunately there isn t any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines any one of which would be a volume in itself i was very dissappointed and i find the other reviews misleading 
worst leonard i ve read this novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries in between the entertainment biz cliches the author can only think to put various assination hits some of the characters are interesting but not believable and they certainly can t make up for the braindead plot read some of his other novels and skip this one 
poorly written this book is poorly written with no editing done whatsoever there are constant misspellings and grammatical errors that detract from the book although there are some interesting aspects to the book i could not get over the way it was written 
bloody awful please save your money ! the so called heroine was so annoying i sided with the bad guy enough said 
disappointed after reading the oprah pick what looks like crazy on an ordinary day i was very disappointed in some things i never thought i d do it took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and i lost interest after about the first fifty pages i don t think pearl cleage is a paticularly talented novelist i think she can write realistic sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters but the story is lacking i loved the very first part of the book where regina burns has just gotten out of rehab is losing her anscestral home so she goes to her aunt abbie for help and comfort and abbie introduces regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause that is the story i wanted to read instead what i got is a very political story infused with the author s belief that black men especially need positive role models i believe we all need to be and have positive role models that it is not just a black thing i wanted to read more about regina and blue i felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed i hope that pearl cleage s next novel is better than this one but i m sorry to say i don t hold out much hope 
you will learn basic crockpot skills hoffman s recipes sound delicious but in fact are often flavorless if you use her recipes you will learn slow cooking tecniques stacking meat in the pot thickening sauces etc but after years of using this book my notes on the recipes have a continual refrain needs more pizzaz add vegetables flavors need more depth 
is christianity really interested in an equitable economy s ethics that is right and wrong are not ordinarily considerations for economists when analyzing current economic functioning or in proposing measures for the future although legal standards must be adhered to this book is a rather uncertain effort to suggest the position that christians should take concerning some of the aspects of economic life that are contrary to christian ideals the author basically accepts a capitalist free market economy based on private property and control and geared to constant growth with highly unequal outcomes as the only legitimate economic form but it becomes immediately evident that an economy based on self interest produces outcomes and side effects that do not comport well with christian ideals laissez faire capitalist economies cannot produce any where near enough dignified jobs that permit all who can work to be lifted out of poverty and become full members of christian society a significant concern of jesus at this point the author is unsure where to turn he suggests that christians should personally give voluntarily sufficient resources to alleviate poverty yet he also seems to lend vague support to government initiatives despite an expressed reluctance for governmental intervention in the economy in addition to the goods and services produced that make for a viable society capitalistic enterprise also can degrade the environment and create hugely profitable businesses based on pornography and gambling with deplorable social consequences the book leaves much doubt as to whether christians should be that concerned about the state of capitalistic economies and their impacts on people in the first place christianity eschews materialism preferring to focus on a greater end if christians are aliens and strangers on earth as the author suggests where is the incentive for remedial efforts furthermore any efforts to plan for a better outcome are criticized as arrogant for failing to note that mankind consists of self centered sinners perhaps the otherworldliness of christianity and the rejection of empowered reasonable men is why the author does not really assess whether christians are now addressing the deleterious consequences of capitalistic economies or make any concrete proposals as to how a christian perspective can become ingrained in an economic system that focuses almost exclusively on profits curiously the author actually analyzes the ramifications of laissez faire capitalism quite well the structural adjustment policies that the imf and the world bank forced on developing nations that got into debt trouble in the s and later are disgraceful the huge inequalities resulting in very widespread poverty that are a part of the us economy is plainly laid out however in the face of all of this evidence concerning the dark side of capitalism the author s reluctance to recommend more vigorous actions even major revamping of our economic system is not really understandable apparently christianity is not really meant to help mankind while on earth 
has no solutions i expected something completely different when i read this book i was expecting that this book would tell about different ways that the future would get energy to the people this book is nothing like that the first two thirds of this book is a diatribe on how everybody is using energy the wrong way it tells that innovation and micro power is the wave of the future and condemns all government subsidies for energy he does not explain why we will be going to micro power but says that s the way it is going to be i have to say i started reading this book and put it down for a while for the racist remarks throughout the book it is told from an indian viewpoint where he makes snide remarks about the british saying that the british east indian company was the ultimate in evil he makes condescending remarks about the americans not being smart enough to have back up generator in silicon valley whereas in bangalore india they have them he is obviously against nuclear power by making outrageous remarks about nuclear wastes not being safe for years i read nuclear renewal and the waste from the newer breeder reactors is a couple of years and they will reduce that as time goes on he is all for the fuel cell and the book is very well written he doesn t say how we are going to get the hydrogen that we will need and talks endlessly about the kyoto protocol like it was the only peace of legislation that mattered on global warming i thought there would be new ideas and processes for the future like biomass or solar chimneys there is nothing new or insightful this book seems more like a list of grievances 
pompous windbag i was asked if umberto eco was as much a pompous windbag in foucault s pendulum as he was in his other novels and responded i would say his novels are aimed squarely at the purveyors of pretension when i was reading foucault s pendulum i got the same pompous windbag impression and concluded that i could have photocopied vast sections of the the necronomican of abdul al hazred and the yog sothoth just as easily and pasted together my own book by following the dungeons and dragons rule book but don t listen to me i have never been that impressed with eco especially as a novelist hamlet said it best words words words or was it very like a whale i suspect eco was just trying to sound as erudite as joyce or at least professor irwin corey however foucault s pendulum might well be his greatest work since no novel he has written since has been as well received i did peek at the sales figures for this novel but they have been suspiciously hidden away in a monastery in the apennines and the only hint i got was the mention of the bump eco s sales received with the popularity of the da vinci code interestingly someone asked why eco didn t sue brown for plagiarism a better question might be why the authors of the holy blood and the holy grail didn t sue eco and the answer of course is follow the money but rest assured despite having attempted to read this pile and given up in disgust i will give it a generous rating stars suffice it to say however that foucault s pendulum had more in common with the da vinci code than just the arcane historical mystery ill be traveling back to new jersey next week and will be able to visit the large dent in the wall of my office where the parabolic arc of this novel met with the obstinacy of lath and plaster but let s be a little fair about this and realize the foucault s pendulum when compared to the other airport gift shop thrillers is certainly adequate to cover the time taken for a trans oceanic flight whether it keeps you awake or not although if they are showing raiders of the lost ark 
hate math you ll hate this book we are up to chapter in this book so far several people in the class have had to take it over several times now the book is too hard at least for a lot of people it is the concepts are not presented clearly it can be very hard to correlate the example problems to the homework problems even with the student solution manual which does not have every odd but every other odd heh i am lost a big group of us get together for a total of hours per week working on our homework with tutors and they are even lost ! ahhhh this book is horrible ! good luck to all whom have to take this course 
couldn t get all the way through the book i was sadly disappointed to find i did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here the characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them everything was very dimensional for me i bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here then a copy for myself so i could get in on the fun i forced myself through half the book before i just tossed it and promised my father a replacement something i d read already and knew he would enjoy but that s just my opinion obviously not shared by many 
manufacturing error on the one hand i loved the book since i am a big fan of thomas paine however my particular copy was missing the last pages or so of the age of reason when they get the printing and or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books they should remove this review at that point i will eagerly buy a new copy 
you only need one atkins book dr atkins new diet revolution contained far more relevant information than the atkins essentials frankly put if you already have one of the atkins books don t waste your money and buy more all you need is one 
are you kidding me with this i really don t mean to sound judgmental but this was the very worst book i have ever read i mean even nancy drew books have more of a mystery than this one did i have always heard good things about the jesse stone novels this was the first and only one i will read i don t know if the grammatical errors were the author s fault or the editor s even the dialogue between characters didn t even have complete sentences very poor sentence structure i agree with c richard s review distracting in that there are terrible grammar errors throughout this entire book and was hard to focus ths story was contrite and very easy to figure out way before the end of the book who the culprit was this is the only review i have given that has been a poor one 
ugh i m a big nora fan but i couldn t even finish this one by the fourth chapter i began to skim way way way to much detail for me which made it boring and slow testing and corrosion is it fake is it real blah blah blah enough ! i did however enjoy the side story about the brother i forget his name but thats it folks unlike all the other reviewers i hated it i say pass on this one but as you can see i m in the minority 
left behind series the left behind series is the best reading i have ever read i admit my reading is not all that much but when i read the very first book i was hooked i read all twelve books in about six weeks they lead me to understand the bible better thank you tim and jerry for such great books corrine robinson 
yawn i read about one hundred pages and then when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding i quit this was my first king book and i am not rushing out to buy another one especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a pages is it any wonder that it is selling on amazon for a penny actually i would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
dublin made me but didn t keep me has the superior writing of frank mccourt and roddy doyle opened the door for anyone to believe their memoirs are worthy of public interest dublin made me is at best a watery account of sheridan s childhood which fails miserably to grip the reader and maintain interest this account is more appropriate for bedtime anecdotes handed from father to child than anything even remotely comparable to the writings of mccourt and other contemporaries if the reader is anticipating the rawness and vigor associated with the accounts of others who have shown the best and the worst of dublin life then they will be disappointed a very forgettable read 
lacks of detailed street names i use this book occasionally but it is lacks the detailed for use by itself where i do use it is with mapquest that tends to not show the smaller lakes but the gazetteer does a much better job 
another city no angels it just didn t do it for me like so many other people i loved midnight in the garden of good and evil it was such a rich unexpected book and came alive in the reading but i fear john berendt had only one in him one great story he found a crime and a city and another series of characters but he just didn t find the magic good writing yes interesting characters somewhat compelling plot no maybe it s just that he tried too hard to make venice new to his readers maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of midnight even though reality didn t afford him similarities to work with maybe he just tried too hard 
disappointing this reads more like a textbook for an interior design course it has little to do with the psychology of your own choice of home setting like another reviewer said the idea seemed fascinating but the book disappoints right away if not for the setup alone the author overuses the same phrases and form to setup her next example it is as though this were her thesis for design school it could also pass for a really good new age book that s how problem centered it is if you have watched designing for the sexes on hgtv you have read this book this book is only interesting and appropriate for interior designers not for anyone seeking insight into our needs and choices when it comes to home 
not so hot page of the book when i conceived this book i had a brilliant premise i would take every excersive in the gym and look at it in terms of possible role in human movemement then later goes on on to list the moves they think are important even debating what should be included there is no scientific method to this only apparently two individuals conceiving an idea for a book i m sure there strength books are good but this a me too book on core performance 
wow what a bad book i was very disappointed with this book i was hoping for a clear and concise overview of world history in order to gain a general understanding of major world events and trends the author had only pages to cover the entire span of world history so why does he waste space rambling about vague sociological trends or how one country might possibly have affected another the writing itself is incredibly clunky and unclear and the organization is somewhat confusing i only ever had a vague grasp of the details of a specific civilization before the author jumped to another geographic area and back or thousand years i couldn t even finish the book i d rather spend my time doing something anything else than spend it muddling through this mess 
brutal trip to the arctic this is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the s narrated by a civil war deserter within the first few pages our hero enlists pilfers letters off battlefield corpses deserts is injured in nyc draft riots ends up in new bedford ma and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going the book was downhill from there page after page described ice and the crew s interminable struggles to get through getting through the book was nearly as interminable the reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him or really understand him at all thus his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles there are elements of fantasy in the book not enough to make it a fantasy but enough to steer a reader off course the scientist on the mission is after a warm garden of eden in the middle of the arctic he is mad or it s fantasy it is hard to know until the end there is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands the most likeable character in the book describes how he got his third hand from that yarn comes the title rope eater the title really has nothing to do with the book other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain besides the tedious turning of the plot the characters lack any development only the three handed man and the captain both tangential characters had any depth whatsoever this book seemed to be an attempt at adventure but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension it never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters mentally and physically it just happened although the reader knew the characters must be suffering it never came through the over writingas one might expect the crew s mission to find the warm garden of eden in the arctic was pointless so was this book it was a disappointment 
a fake if you want to buy this book it s your chioce but you have to knwo first that the sevillian school of edge weapons is near the bus stop to kripton it has never existed i know what i said becouse ive been living in seville more than years its said on the back cover of the book in seville as troughout many parts of spain one can find training halls whereedge weapons combats is practiced today as it was years ago oh yes and if you go to central park in new york and look beetwen trees you can find a native americans community living as they do years ago i don t know why loriega decided to create the fantasy about sevillian steel perhaps he needed an exotic title for his book if you want to buy this book it s your money and you can do whattever you want whit it the book can have interesting techniques but as it s said in spain te dan gato por liebre literally they give you a cat instead of a rabbit 
strange book i too was required to read this book in the th grade i couldn t understand how this book could be an award then or now i m a huge eckert fan but this story just doesn t cut the mustard for a better eckert book check out johnny logan

look again i found this book completely unhelpfull and a waste of money i know nothing about the travel industry and looked to this book as my introduction into it i am more confused than ever and now have no intention of entertaining the idea of opening my own home based agency thanks but no thanks 
can t get started i d read all of david baldacci s novels and anticipated settling down for a good long read however that wasn t the case this is my second time starting this book and i just can t get past the first few chapters it just doesn t hold my attention like his previous titles for those of you reading baldacci for the first time please don t let this novel turn you off to his other titles i started reading his books after seeing the movie absolute power with clint eastwood absolute power was his first novel and after reading that i was hooked several of his novels have reached number on the ny times bestseller list i m hoping that his next book will restore my faith in him 
was she really that good of a mother i don t feel that miller made much of an attempt to prove that anna was in fact a good mother like another reviewer said i don t think she was a bad mother but the book really didn t go into much detail about anna s relationship with molly especially up until anna ex husband filed for custody and instead focused on anna s life experiences and psyche after brian said he wouldn t send molly back anna didn t even seem that concerned about molly s mental and emotional well being she just focused on her notion that leo s actions were simply taken out of context and while she wanted to see molly again i got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her rights as a mother not out of a concern for her daughter and what was so great about leo anyway he wasn t exactly nice to anna often condescending to her and from the beginning i felt that his affection for molly was a farse simply to stay on anna s good side he also seemed sexually possessive of anna like the scene when he kept having sex with her after molly came into the bed because of a nightmare i think anna loved her daughter but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love since she had never felt such an attraction before as a result her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for months with dire consequences although she did show some signs of remorse she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter s welfare if she had put her daughter first from the beginning instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new family she and leo were forming then she probably never would have lost custody of her child 
vaudeville she seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i e much of today s pentecostalism charasmatics i e the toronto brownsville blessing a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic and hollywood in studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine it was just get saved and jesus loves you a cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow 
servsafe coursebook disappointed i am very disappointed in this purchase the only reason that i bought this book was to receive the new scantron test ! the scantron test that arrived with the book was the old test all information at the amazon site said that the new test was included that information was in error 
had to force myself to read i really wanted to read this book i ve read a lot about the nazi persecution of jews as well as their persecution of russians slavs homosexuals anarchists jehovah s witnesses and so on but i hadn t read much about their persecution of the roma or gypsies and i wanted to learn about it but the book is extraordinarily dry the author did not bring the events to life at all it s pretty hard to make a subject as inherently dramatic as the systematic persecution of an entire people not very interesting but the author succeeded what s worse really was that as other reviewers suggested there was a powerful theme of underplaying the importance of what happened to the roma i was very disturbed by this i give the book two stars instead of one because i did learn a few things but i will be looking for another book on the subject because i didn t learn enough 
a christian copper guide to paganism a christian book for christian police that encourages the police to seek out evil occultists and arrest them note how the system does not have a guide book on investigating christian and jewish groups the christian coppers only have a guide book for pagan religions the sooner america falls the sooner we will have freedom in odin s name wyatt kaldenberg 
rubbish a conservative but well meaning friend of mine lent me this book upon first read i was astounded continuously by the utter tripe that dribbles from one page to the next in a viscous stream of fetid crap this is taken from the website dedicated to this book greatnesscomi have believed and taught that only two nations ever were ordained of god for greatness ! israel and america ! this is a must read for everyone but especially for clergy and others in key leadership we must be moved to action and the saving of the freedoms of our great nation the road to saving freedoms lies in cutting taxes for the rich the road to saving personal freedom lies in developer more and more sophisticated nukes how about the russia and china military build up chapters does this mental midget not understand the utter incapacity of either of those nations to even pose a threat to us thanks to the gillions we invest in defense this is just utter and complete crap this entire book from front to back is an affront to christianity the supposed centerpiece of its ideology i m not surprised america elected george bush with budwesier swigging armchair generals like this man actually receiving acolades for such trash 
what happened how utterly disapointing i had no idea that there was a non musical version of jack the giant killer terrible acting awful costumes lame plot without the songs this movie is a drabby bore the goofy songs are the key to this otherwise dull movie 
blackstone audio is awful the blackstone audio book version of turn of the screw is read by pat bottino mr bottino s uninspired presentation destroyed the story perhaps mr bottino got better in later ventures i don t know but he mangled turnavoid this version at all costs 
carr promises the earth the moon and the stars but of course he cannot deliver once again carr s central truth is to know how the addiction works is to be free of it unfortunately this is simply a false dawn the greater the need for a solution the more willingly we suspend disbelief and trust in a system that promises an end to our problem this is not to say the book contains nothing of worth but carr s demand for total deference and his insistence on offering a complete cure inevitably prepare us for eventual disappointment we are all more intelligent than we are capable and awareness of the insanity of addiction never saved anyone from the disease 
check this book out of your public library white author andrew hacker mercilessly flays whites and shamelessly sucks up to blacks two nations is for whites who want to feel guilty about being white and blacks who want to blame their troubles on whites for people truly interested in race and culture i recommend buying thomas sowell s race and culture and returning this book to your public library 
a failure of nerve yes there are worthwhile portions of this book such as the author s dissection of some of the idiocies of free market capitalism and the children of abraham nevertheless the book could have been so much better first i must heartily agree with those who have criticized the book s poor organization where was were the editor ssecond the book does go on at unnecessary length about princess diana furthermore although wheen is certainly aware of mother teresa who died days after princess diana he gives ma t who is as far as i m concerned one of the most over rated public figures of the th century no more than a passing mention now ma t is a subject ripe for the sort of treatment the author gives to princess diana however not a word about ma t s grotesque warehouses of the sick and dying not a word about the vast sums of money and other contributions collected by her organizations that were obviously not actually used and not a word about her perverse ideas on suffering for example i think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot to share it with the passion of christ i think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people third although wheen does deal to some extent with the anti scientific fraud of creationism he doesn t give it enough attention in my opinion he does not deal with the shroud of turin fourth the relatively few pages on rightwing conspiracy theories seem like lip service there is so much more that he could have mentioned he could have mentioned that the birchers still would have us believe that president ike was a conscious agent of the communist conspiracy he could have mentioned the persistent efforts to ahem whitewash slavery part of the heinous liberal plot to defame the white christian south recently one of those efforts the booklet southern slavery as it was found itself into classes at cary christian school in cary nc he could have mentioned the ongoing attempts to promote the obvious lie that large numbers of americans were being held prisoner by vietnam for years after the return of the pows and that there was an elaborate government coverup to hide the existence of these prisoners you can still find assertions that there are still us prisoners in vietnam he could have mentioned those things and many others but he did not finally he seems afflicted with the must have balance disease that crops up in so many pundits hence the section devoted to the crimes of various gasp heinous leftoids much of this section verges on being outright ridiculous for example he goes into high dudgeon over the dastardly anti americanism of noam chomsky who among other crimes was insufficiently critical of the khmer rouge wheen conveniently fails to mention that the us government for no discernible reason than to spite the government of vietnam who were the ones who overthrew the khmer rouge became tacit supporters for nearly a decade of the khmer rouge despite their murderous regime the united states government continued to recognize the ousted regime as the legitimate occupants of cambodia s seat in the united nations arnold r isaacs in vietnam shadows most of that period occurred during republican governments in the us but it wouldn t be convenient to acknowledge that wheen also gets self righteous about something michael moore a favorite whipping boy of american fascists and their useful idiots wrote that is obviously a comment on the savagely murderous absence of any sort of selectivity in choice of targets wheen conveniently neglects to mention that ann coulter openly expressed the wish that the planes had hit the new york times coulter has also openly advocated the persecution of liberals in fact far more prevalent and dangerous than any heinous leftoids are the legions of poison pen and poison tongue right wing propagandists backed by vast amounts of right wing money who constantly dump their raw sewage into american society no it wouldn t do at all to acknowledge that particular unpleasant truth about life in these united states this books s glaring faults significantly outweigh its small virtues in my opinion 
needed a hero well considering all the exciting things that have been happening in my life i was surprised that reading about the life of the universe was so dull i can watch a sunset or listen to the sound of a bird singing and that can be wonderful but i suspect that if the authors were to have written about a bird singing or the sunset i wouldn t have recognized it let alone enjoyed it much if this book was an attempt to synthesize science with the wisdom of all cultures then give me a genealogy from the old testament any ol day i could tell that the authors knew a lot but unfortunately they didn t know enough about how to capture my attention now i m no stranger to heavy reading so it can t be the density of information concealed in semi poetic language that made the story unexciting i think it was the tell medontshowme style of overlong explanations of the beauty and wonder of the universe that might have been significant in this regard unfortunately academicians haven t quite got the hang of how to make countless acts of procreation throughout the history of life sexy nor have they been able to capture the mystery of the ever shy rainbow it didn t help that it had a quotwe need to do better us humans quot ending one might have made that criticism of the authors for their worthwhile undertaking fallen short 
not much of a storm the approaching storm does not reach the level of the first books in the star wars expanded universe the book is a tale of two jedis obiwan kenobi and luminara unduli along with their padawans anakin skywalker and barriss offee being sent to the insignificant planet of ansion to reach an agreement between two widely divergent races of beings to keep the planet from seceding from the republic sinister forces are working behind the scenes to encourage the secession even though ansion is not an important place it is tied in with a number of other worlds through old treaties if ansion leaves the republic the others are obligated to follow the jedi cannot let this happen all of this could have told in a short story or novella much of the book involves an interminable trip through the prairies of ansion as the jedis try to find the borokii the overclan of the alwari our heroes overcome a number of mishaps along the way find the borokii convince them of the correctness of a proposed agreement with the city folk of the unity and then still have to make their way back to the city of cuipernam before a binding vote to secede is taken mr foster s writing is not the best his touch with dialogue is heavy and stilted one exchange between obi wan and anakin can serve as an example anakin are in the final analysis all relationships between sentients ultimately reduced to politics of one kind or another master obi wan obiwan it is thought so by many enough said i don t think our two heroes would hold a conversation like that as usual with the star wars books each new tale introduces new species my favorite in the approaching storm was the ever curious gwurran named tooquii i couldn t help but be reminded of the ewoks tooqui even though small in stature and a real pain to have along for much of the journey proves his worth at a key point in their struggles we also spend an inordinate amount of time in the book experiencing anakin s internal struggles with missing his mother and with his ongoing feelings that he is not being allowed to advance as fast as his skills warrant i realize that establishing anakin s frame of mind is important for future events but mr foster dwells on it too much 
i just don t understand why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book honestly what has this author contributed to the world with this book was it the characters no they ve all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years ie cocky and handsome fbi agent beautiful but dangerous killer with a past take nosht fbi boss etc was it the deep insight into the characters themselves a laugh out loud no there was nothing coming close to character development was there some new and clever writing style unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary i call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel how about the plot was that something worth my time not unless you haven t ever watched suspence movie in your life so honestly what the hell makes this book worth anyone s time all i can find in this book are two dimensional characters needless sub plots ludicris dialogue and empty promises were lied to about the main character s fate in the beginning and we re lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of hitchcock as a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape hollywood s onslaught of needless pointless and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage i can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money this man does not deserve our money and certainly does not deserve to write anything other than an apology letter to the world for dumbing us down into thinking that this type of writing is anything other than trash 
another me me me book by yancey mr yancey better clean up his act this is another me me me book by mr yancey he has no respect for jesus christ and the honor of the name of christ what book of substance has he written besides all the pop psychotheology junk has mr yancey written one book to protect the integrity of the church against those who try to destroy it for instance has he written one book against homosexuality this is the most important issue today in america s christianity and the greatest insult to god hasn t he heard of sodom and gomorrah what does he think will happen to america does he think that god will pleasantly turn aside as america s christian churches ordain homosexuals what does mr yancey think about spiritual battle obviously he is blind as a bat when it comes to spiritual war even when homosexuality is the most important issue facing the church he refuses to stand up for christ and his honor and protect the body of christ what a man writes shows a lot about his character and goals certainly mr yancey cares only about making money and not about defending the christian church against those who attack it 
a tough slog that s more about quarks than jaguars i picked this up because i thought it was going to have some information about ecuador the jaguar section in it it does about one whole pages worth the rest of the pages concern gell manns ideas on the inter connectedness of things gell mann for those of you who don t buy the nobel prize winning scientist collector cards was the identifier of the quark that object that is smaller than what had previously been thought of as the smallest element electrons are made up of a collection of quarks this book is interesting but rough slogging at times as gell mann tries to give you an instant understanding of the last ten years of modern physics this should appeal to fans of richard feynman and douglas hofstadter although the style isn t as smooth as either of them 
no surprises here after reading an overview regarding the plot of this book i decided to give ed mcbain s latest novel a whirl after minutes into the book i had the mystery figured out okay i was a little off on one of the characters i surmised it was a girl in the caribbean and actually it was a black girl who worked at the local ice cream depot but still i read the entire book in one day and while enjoyable it is predictable even to the politically correct bush bashing bad economy and he stole the election from gore dag nabbit which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot if you want a mindless easy toputdown and finish quickly book alice in jeopardy is for you if you want a novel full of surprises and twists amazing characters and an author who leaves his personal politics out of the story pick up a harlan coben novel 
disappointing i have loved many of jodi picoult s other books but this one seemed too far fetched i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in fact detracted from it many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release 
now what i listened to this work on cd it took two attempts before i completed it i completed listening to the first cd and thought i had missed something so i re doubled my efforts and began again i came away with the feeling that there were a couple of things of value but overall you will really have to dig deep to find them also if you are a christian reader listener you won t get past track one on the first cd even after studying world religions in college and living in asia for a year i was left with very little to walk away with from this book 
only if you can sew while this book does have a few pictures they seem quite old the one or two items i liked didn t have any instructions for if you are not a sewer than this book is not for you i found the book very confusing definitely written for the person with sewing background sorry 
utter new age silliness although the concept probably has merit you wouldn t know it to read this book this is a lot more religion that science i am quite disappointed 
undesirable it s the polar opposite of good writing it s so familiar so conversational so unturgid and so padded with fluffy stuff it s unreadable even worse than i figured it would be oh well now i know after wondering all these years 
i expected more another book i read for class i knew a little about margery kempe beforehand like she had children i didn t know that the first autobiography ever written in english was so boring i felt like margery repeated herself over and over i wanted more details about her life about her husband her children and her pilgrimages i don t think i would pick this up unless you are specifically interested in early christianity writings 
really bad ending i liked this book up until the ending i expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable its what i thought was going to happen but at least satisfying and believable considering the power grisham gave the cia throughout this entire book instead the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
an odd little book this is a strange little book the intention is good love conquers all dealing with aging etc howeverit is full of negative images and frankly is creepy when the boy is awake he is exasperating annoying foul mouthed and strange the only time the mother shows her love is by furtively entering her son s room and singing her little love ditty for what it s worth my wife hates it too and refers to it as the stalking story it has been unceremoniously pitched out of our house if you want a better rendition of this sort of thing try the runaway bunny or guess how much i love you 
disappointing and long i found this book disappointing its pages drag on and on but never deal with the topic it addresses why but not the how i was looking for the how 
remote spewing i first came across the subject of remote viewing one night as i was switching tv channels and found a show about psychic spying imagine my shock when they showed a picture of my own company sri international ! i ve always been interested in anything exploring psychic phenomena but to learn that this type of research was started at my own company in the s was exciting stuff indeed the next day at work i learned there were still people here who remembered this program and the scientist who started it hal putoff not sure of last name spelling some of my coworkers said at the time of the project s heyday they experimented with lots of employees sometimes they d put a bunch of regular folk in a giant room and give them coordinates to see if anyone could view them needless to say scientists are a hard crowd and many found it amusing if not silly physicists i know who worked with dr putoff said the army eventually took over the project this is told in the documentary i mentioned above dr putoff was also interviewed in the tv show and so were many others including some of the remote viewers so i was thrilled when this book psychic warrior was published i had hoped it would have tons of more information about what the project was doing now but then i read it and was utterly disappointed like linus the reviewer above i think this book was poorly written and the author is completely full of himself his constant grandstanding and egomania makes this very hard to get though to the interesting parts about the actual remote viewing also i wonder about how someone can work on a top secret project and then write a tell all book about it perhaps the author made a deal to embellish certain parts of his story so it wouldn t be taken too seriously either way if you think you can wade through all the boring garbage about his home life and how great he is you might possiblly learn a little but i can t recommend this book as a tool to help you get there 
not that great this book is not very good it basically repetes the same information many times for example it gives the species descriptions twice but only has about five sentances on a proper cage for a conure even w the descriptions it didn t talk about the specific conures traits and personality only how big it is and where it can be found in the wild not even if it is readily available as a pet or if that species is on the verge of extinction therefor you can not make any judgement at all wheather that bird will make a good pet i have read many parrot books and the is nothing specificly on conures in this one in my opinion the author just wrote about parrots in general replacing the word quotparrotquot with the word quotconurequot the only interesting thing in this book was the pictures which gave it the extra star otherwise it would have only gotten one 
the lerning process as a loan officer in training this book has been a great tool in my lerning it explain in detail and clear how to do your job step by step and how to avoid mistakes i am glad that i found this book and recommended to any one interested in lerning about the mortgage business 
very boring i really was interested in the topic of arab history but found the writing so boring i had a hard time staying awake i finally gave up i would look for another book on this subject 
factually inaccurate if i were in hoboken having a chicken emergency i wouldn t panic it is hard to feel empathy for arthur the main character in this engaging but factually inaccurate thanksgiving tale by daniel pinkwater as he bumbles his way from one disaster to another the premise that not a single shopkeeper in the whole of hoboken has a turkey in their freezer is at best far fetched at worst it is factually inaccurate and a damning incitement on pinkwater s research whilst writing this book this reviewer knows for a fact that sandra d s mini mart th st had a freezer full of plump gobblers last thanksgiving and had arthur visited king s super market hudson st he d have found cranberry sauce as well i m all for warming cheery tales of triumph over tragedy but when they re this sloppy with the detail they re hard to swallow my nephew s first comment when he read this book was i done a guff and quite frankly i think that says it all disappointing 
you wouldn t want to share a carriage with this fellow i started this book because i love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation yes there are moments of great wit however they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a little golden book it s not the sublime non linearity of joyce s writing or ornette coleman s playing it s the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree certainly a unique achievement i guess but so is lou reed s quotmetal machine music quot 
not for neophytes beware if you are not familiar with the tools and commands of this program this book is not for you the author particularly in the early portions of the book skips steps and gives incorrect information for example in the directions for creating a honeycomb graphic the author says to create a fivesided polygon p without seeing that figure shows a six sided polygon a new person will create this polygon according to directions and be totally frustrated with the fact that the sides are slanted and in no way will create the object needed for this exercise after creating the correct polygon the author says to connect the corner points however without being able to see the majority of these corner points due to lack of directions a person familiar with the program would probably know the right steps to take here there is no way to complete this exercise this is just one example there are many such problems in this book not only are there missing steps in exercises there are missing words in sentences which makes it hard to follow i would not recommend this book for someone just starting out in flash mx on the other hand if you are familiar with the program or a mind reader you can overlook some of these problems the whining about what was wrong with the program didn t help either 
not what i expected the book might be ok for a very young reader however from the summary and from the other review i thought the book would be helpful to a young person with a telescope to help them find what s out there i just received the book today and am returning it because it will certainly not be useful in this way 
confused this book has interesting episodes lucknow seringpatam egypt and the role of france versus the british but lacks a logic or argument which would justify the book it touches on europeans collecting local objects and local rulers buying foreign technology and advice to defend themselves however as it starts in north america there should be discussion of why artefacts of north american indians were not collected on the other hand there could be some reference to the tradition of collecting of antiquities see jonathon scott pleasures of antiquity or the catalogue of the exhibition at the gulbenkian foundation exotica the role of france in opposing the british in india should have been argued through intriguing in the mutiny but allies in the crimean war in general the prose is over adjectived why is the dictionary of national biography compendious when is is actuaully comprehensive and the illustrations are a disgrace too small and dark the wonderful col mordaunts cockfight reproduces as a black postage stamp 
there are better guides while i had high hopes for this guidebook i found it a bit topical and overgeneral nonprofit organizations would do better to invest in a more thorough professional introductory guide to the topic of fundraising 
lots of good advice but poorly organized the book is filled with plenty useful advice but it is so poorly organized that its potential effectiveness is marginalized i had hoped to learn some key strategies and tools to use in a converstation however i spent most of my time trying to understand how each little tidbit of advice fit into the bigger picture of actually starting and controlling a conversation somewhere amongst all the advise are the key elements to becoming a better communicator but its left to the reader to assemble them into a practical guide to conversation 
thin and padded out i ve always enjoyed sara paretsky s novels despite the left wing preaching in the past this has been subordinated to character plot but not here there s not much plot a few elements here there it never really drives the story far too much space is given to the standard left wing caricature of the rich the repetitive boring stereotyping of family values as just so much plutocratic hypocrisy ms paretsky we know you hate the american rich they re probably as hideous as you paint them to be but here they re just cardboard cut out characters and of course the book is just a long boring wait to see just how the filthy rich committed the crime how they ll get away with it plus the satisfying way in which the horrible rich are once again forced to cough up the money they at first of course refused to give this is getting tedious 
more like a walk through boredom someone s trying to sabotage the making of a documentary i thought it might be interesting i m sorry i was wrong unfortunately the book was downright predictable in some areas it was just plain contradictory the characters lacked depth and the plot was extremely weak when you see this book on the shelf just keep walking 
look how smart we are this may be the worst book on real estate or mortgage markets that i have ever seen the authors seem to be saying quotlook how smart we are quot i have an mba from university of chicago and much of the book is a bad rephrasing of inroductory corporate finance my book for the real estate class at university of chicago was by bruggman and fisher although that book will not win any awards it is vastly superior this book could easily lose of its contents don t waste your money 
don t waste your money after reading this book i still haven t decided whether the author is a genius or a nutcase most of the main characters ultimately die a particularly useless and gruesome death and the book never seems to arrive at a particular point even the prologue drags on endlessly 
tedious this has to be the most boring book i have ever read well i haven t quite finished it yet as it s taking forever to push my way through it and i m sure that more boring books exist i just haven t read them i wanted to learn about kkr and lbos particularly as a division of kkr recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer i was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes but this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved there really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information and a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material it felt a bit like watching someone else s home video it probably means a lot to the people involved especially as they ll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants but it s painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness im sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway people don t reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years what are remembered are broad brushstrokes and this is what the author should have written there are occasional moments of entertainment like ted forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds but most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting the fact is i wanted some of this information in this book as it provided some of this albeit with a lot of suffering on my part i ll give it two stars update well i did finish this book eventually my final opinion is much the same 
queen alex we get that she is very connected and all that jazz but the writing is exactly like she is writing this as a term paper would it have killed her to have a little personality this sentence was too weird for me i come from a famiy of writers professors doctors people who focus on the world of ideas on the world of thinking rather than on the world of looks p um yeah as opposed to the rest of us losers whose families focus only on looks what the hell is she talking about 
unconfortable to read e book is the first time i tried to read an e book and the experience was very unconfortable unconfortable to read impossible to record as a file only to read in pc and at the end impossible to print ! please try another way to sell electronics books 
not as good as it could have been it starts out like laura bush s rules for driving but skydives after the opening pages in which the then yearold laura kills a young man with her car who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend my interest in the book sharply dove after that as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about laura bush 
not for beginners i had to buy this book for my class this book doesn t instruct how to input equations not enough example answer codes for each problem less visual and tedious to follow all words 
if you still think cholesterol causes heart disease this book s for you have you taken meat eggs out of your diet are you still trying to limit saturated fat to less than of your total calories are you popping statins to keep that cholesterol level below the maximum de jure how about some pills for that hypertension do you need more little brown bottles sitting on the bathroom vanity don t be fooled by the title of this book scott deron takes the politically correct route through the cholesterol saturated fat minefield choosing dogma over science at every turn where s the new information about crp in this book eighty percent of this book is a rehash of the same bromides we ve been swallowing for years cardiovascular disease meanwhile has continued to climb unabated if you re looking for the root cause of cardiovascular disease you won t find it in this book if you re looking for interventions that split with the already disproved ama aha doctrine you won t find that here either do yourself a favor use your money to buy colpo s the great cholesterol con mccully s the heart revolution or francis never be sick again your heart will love you for it 
okay for a beginner i found this book rather welllame to me and this is just me the information was nothing that you could not find on most basic websites i would look elsewhere 
a new low for b s brad sugars this shows all the hallmarks of another rigging of the review process by shameless spruiker brad sugars notice all star reviewers have only ever reviewed books by b s and low and behold they all recieve stars and most are thinly disguised promotions complete with embellished statements of the undoubted and profound effects it s purchase will have on your business imploring you to buy it complete with exclamation marks bs started action international business coaching with franchise holders it seems to me a portion of those are working overtime through review writing to ingratiate themselves with the boss i don t doubt mr b s has probably done some admirable things but the two books of his that i made the mistake of purchasing instant cashflow and real estate riches were the text equivalent of vaporware with little beneficial content and many tired cliches so to summarise boo to you mr b s living proof that snake oil salesmen never die they just change industries you ve reached a new low 
not so good i just didn t like this book very much while it may have been a case of personal taste this book didn t seem very engaging or interesting it was an interesting idea to begin with but the book seemed to drag on and on it could have been a lot better than it was i wouldn t recomend it 
no wit no sense no vote this book was not enjoyed by either of my children it is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don t understand the meaning of the words i have an eleven year old and a four year old both of which were bored by the second page the word search within words is a great concept but i expected there to be some sense about it so the kids could be entertained and challenged by the text i am very disappointed 
trite and banal i wonder how long it will be before frost s literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be these are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader what he has to say is obvious and unoriginal how he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best at its worst it is no better than a limerick posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation manipulation of his celebrity image as the new england farmer poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed how earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding bad poetry from a twisted man 
old news far from containing any ground breaking revelations this book is essentially old news except for a few details that block has added virtually everything in it can be found in harold peterson s the man who invented baseball which was published in 
catherine s revelations for the church and individuals catherine of siena would recieve revelations from god and enter ecstatic trances in those transes she would have quotdialoguesquot with god which her sisters recorded thus the title catherine was used by the pope to be peacemaker between warring cities and as such she was a papal apologist meeting with nobles and dignitaries throughout europe a different role for a woman of that time as mystic she would dialogue with god about the church the pope priests and recieve counsel that are recorded in the quotdialoguesquot the prose is instructional not exhortive in nature it is not a book that one reads expecting to come away uplifted and enthused rather you will recieve sound direction 
a bad book this book was a reading for my rd grade daughter i have no idea how or why this book ever won an award unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written and the illustrations were just as sad 
cf adams homicide investigator this color book is a disgrace to every african american as a homicide investigator who has worked many murders of young black teenager males this coloring book doesn t help to stop the problem on black on black murders involving juvenile males i am outrage by the images of weaponry and killing and prison and thing of that nature i don t see this coloring book to be a fitting image for our young people maybe the author of this coloring book should come and spend a day with me during an autopsy of a year black male who was killed by gang violence 
bio tech neo lidite o k i didn t buy the book but i searched for reference to immortality which as i suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author lets see now he speaks of the demographic problems associated with longer life and lower firtility first obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last to or so years of a radically extended life or years or so the premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality immaging a world in which you could live to years or so with the strength and clearity of a or year old are you going to just sit down in your rocking chair even going with the worker ratios in japan for instance that he speaks of only for every retired we could adjust the theory that social security operates if you retire at age with indefinite life span you should collect for just years go back to work start a business go back to school learn something new all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential problems with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages also age differences between the developed world and the underdeveloped world yes there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just older women refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios in the north and younger men refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations as well as selective gender bias in the south or underdeveloped world maybe the influence an older somewhat more femine population in the west might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world just a thought but waite a minute ! life extension will be available to the men as well as the women unless we find more men just wanting to roll over and die mr fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that makes us human is wrong i have a question to pose to him and any of you out there what is so good about being human lets see we are a vehicle for the the selfish gene which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next and after the age of reproduction who cares right so we are disposable birthshcoolworkreproductiondeath right about when we start to begin to live the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself like francis i was born in the middle of the baby boom generation i am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley i have always known it would happen and i have a better than chance at seeing this this was considered impossible years ago and i and others like me would state this and be shrugged off what is really of concern to me is that now we know it is possible but that some believe we should just roll over and die rediculous ! we should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the birth schoolworkreproductiondeath senerio ! 
as sick pretentious and nasty as could be we all know that o j simpson is guilty of this horrific double murder and that he was able to buy justice thanks to his shameless dream team lawyers or liars and their utterly despicable tactics despite the countless lies found here what i find most offensive nasty and sickening is how simpson refers to himself as being a battered husband say what lies more lies and nothing but big nasty and fat lies 
disturbing statements about homosexuality for one thing cantor claims the ancient greeks were so gay i dipute that i think ancient greeks were just living in a very temperature wise hot sunny climate and as a result were often semi nude or even nude with people of the same sex the affection the same sex showed each other was traditional and very most likely didn t usually include the act of doing it also on other homosexual points it s somewhat wrong of cantor to point out gay english kings even though a defense of this could be that cantor was only pointing a fact in this instance i have studied medieval history for years and never before heard of this terrible fact of these particular english monarchs engaging in the bibilically sinful act of homosexuality a personal point on something different i also got of bored of hearing how english and spanish people ate hey neither of these groups are noted for their great food tacos are mexican food talk more about what italians ate in the middle ages please ! cantor has done better writing i prefer his book on the plague to this one by far ! 
what they didn t teach the writer about writing while the facts in this book are interesting it is such a difficult read how any editor let this book by is beyond me you can find out more about our society and the events of this period by visiting a retirement home as compared to reading this book paraphrasing that switches from first to third person and overall rambling makes this a terrible read this book reads like a high school project 
oh boy more lets understand the terrorist garbage the religion of peace is at it again ! in response to the popes words muslims all over the world respond with violence destruction rage hatred burning down buildings burning papal effigies issuing fatwas against the pope and even shooting a year old nun in the back wow such peace from a religion of peace if islam is a religion of peace then all the guns in the world are pink flowers and every nuclear bomb a soft feathery pillow violence for words destruction for speech please ! this is a religion of war and bereft mindless year old bags like noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age this old bag of a man gives muslims free passes and blames america question when will the world start holding to account the actions of muslims and stop blaming others such as bush america the pope or god knows who else how many more innocent people will die at the hand of muslims before the western world finally and for the first time holds the muslims accountable for their own actions rather than someone else well im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of islamofacism im tired of the leftist media beating up on israel and coming to the side of middle eastern tyrants who shoot year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words and then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope ! can you believe it yes idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word its unreal ! a grown man got a gun deliberately aimed it at a year old woman s backside and deliberately pulled the trigger purposefully killing her in cold blood and yet according to socialist america hating leftists he couldn t help it its not his fault its the pope s fault guys ! respond to words with violence and then blame the speaker absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility as absurd as that sounds i m sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that and they are idiots like noam 
disappointed by reading all of the other reviews i thought that this book would be right up my alley and the actual story line was but the execution of the story really lacks something i felt no real connection to the characters and there was never any suspense to the writing that made me want to read further it s not that i disliked the book it s that it didn t stirred my emotions at all i felt that it was a waste of time 
readable but not worth the money this book was on the bestseller s shelf at my local bookstore i asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews shocking as a number of other customer s have commented on this site this book was not worth the money it cost it was silly contrived and unrealistic the cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time i typically don t read romance novels but i can t begin to imagine that that s possible 
disappointing and insulting thomas m disch approaches what should be an engaging topic to any sf lover with a holier thanthou attitude that is both condescending and unappealing i purchased this book believing it would study the impact of sf on american culture as the title suggests instead disch taints his diatribe with his own offensive bias perhaps his sourest assertion is that of sf as the ultimate boy s club run for and by the men why disch is so enamored of this male dominated theory he proceeds to deny mary shelley as the true founder of the genre and instead raises edgar allen poe to the pedestal instead his weak reason he asserts that fewer people read shelley than poe furthermore he credits shelley s parents and husband as the reason behind her success at all because god forbid a woman might have laid the foundation for disch s beloved genre the entire book is tainted with these sort of chauvinistic opinions what i thought would be a dissertation on sf in american culture is little more than one man s attempts to inflict his bias on the public spare yourself the indignation of reading such arrogant and bigoted opinions as this you ll find nothing but rage at the ignorance of some folk 
after race after reading this book i ve decided to write a book called no more blackness how the hip hop culture moved back to africa 
american mania when less would have been better peter whybrow s finest moments are to be found at the beginning and at the end of this book in which he provides an eloquent impassioned and highly quotable critique of contemporary american society ideally these two sections should be treated as independent essays because they really don t deserve to go down with the rest of the ship which in this case is a very long exposition of an error ridden poorly though lengthily defended and well just plain wrong hypothesis the short version of whybrow s thesis is that americans are manic because america was populated by migrants who were curiousity driven risk takers and that somehow this resulted in changes in neurobiology which in turn perpetuate and perhaps create this was vague the inability to be satified with enough one might expect this kind of individualistic theory from a psychiatrist which is a profession that frequently misses the larger picture what one doesn t expect is the degree to which whybrow explores the migrant mindset without offering a shred of evidence for its existence no evidence can be offered most of these early migrants are quite thoroughly dead notwithstanding the fact that a significant proportion of migrants came to america against their will africans chinese and most women to name a few there simply is no means to evaluate whether any migrant group anywhere experiences a shift in the activity of neurochemicals to claim otherwise is sheer nonsense whybrow makes a fine attempt at appearing to offer support for his claims by quoting from venerable old dinosaurs although whybrow quotes at considerable length from adam smith giving the reader the false impression that whybrow understands economics he does not analyze america s manic spending with depth instead he offers a series of broad well known statistics about wealth distribution economic trends etc which tell us very little about the actual psychology involved in our supposed spending frenzy all this could be forgiven had there been an adequate amount of thought put into the central tenets which form the bulk the book but here again whybrow falls short he tends to rely on popular prejudices more than actual research his blythe claim that the fall of soviet russia signaled the triumph of laissez faire capitalism over communism stands as one of the more ridiculous statements in the book not withstanding the very obvious communist elephant in the room china no reputable economist on the past years actually treats laissez faire capitalism as anything more than a quaint myth his assumption that obesity is somehow related to unbridled greed is equally absurd when was the last time you saw an obese ceo a simple comparative field trip to a mcdonald s and let s say a high end french restaurant on the upper east side would have added a vital piece of factual information so deplorably missing from whybrow s analysis for unlike the exec moms and financial wiz kids who whybrow seems to think are representative samples of america your average wage earner does not suffer from overscheduled children jet lagged interpersonal relations and turbo charged consumption if you want to read a well written exposition of some of the unfounded myths explaining contemporary america then this book is for you if not then read jared diamond kevin phillips or chalmers johnson 
boring disappointment don t waste your time with this one it ll be a long while before i read another patterson novel 
not the well rounded book you would expect from the title this book is part of the everything series of books so you would expect it to have a little bit of everything about potty training in it unfortunately i had to read the entire book to find out that the author s clear bias towards infant potty training continues into the sections on toddler training i was hoping for a less opinionated book one with more general information 
false facts uninformed waste o dough if you want to believe an illusion go for it some readers say he is well informed whoa this guy talks about science without any credentials to do so if it makes you feel good to believe that the us is bad the environment is collapsing and we need socialism to survive then this is the book for you if you are open minded but want truthful facts to make your own opinion find another source waste of money 
not a book for those curious about asia one question that might come to mind while reading this book is why why in the world would one bother to travel all the way across asia and back restricting that journey almost exclusively to sitting in trains like p j o rourke theroux seems to be interested only in drinking and describing what a horrible time he is having in horrible places he rarely stops to see anything and even when he does those stops are very brief even the few genuinely beautiful places he bothers to see are often described in rather deprecatory terms see for example his description of the sikh golden temple in amritsar as a copper gilt gazebo in the center of a tank the only places he seems to have liked at all were istanbul peshawar the ashau valley in vietnam and kyoto incidentally one of the few bits of the book worth reading is his account of his meeting with the great turkish novelist yasar kemal in istanbul indeed the attitudes he expresses about the people in the countries he visits are so appallingly and consistently contemptuous with absolutely no attempt at understanding that they border on the racist the reviewers who refer to theroux as a curmudgeon and a misanthrope are expressing mild judgments in my opinion the stars i am giving this are for the interesting descriptions of vietnam the one place where he seems to have tried to practise some empathy with the locals and the underbelly of the japanese soul but i recently picked up a copy of michael palin s book himalaya and am looking forward to what i hope will be an approach refreshingly different from that of theroux 
not really a little house book at all the first four years was released many years after these happy golden years brought a sweet tidy ending to the series i did not like this book and it just does not feel like it belongs with the other books it is about hardship and bitter times and disturbs the harmony of the other titles i d recommend serious thought be given before this book is begun 
risque designs with little instruction most of the t shirt designs in this book are just plain bizarre a lot of large holes cut out of the t shirt or jagged edges cut through it not something i would ever ever wear ok i would maybe wear three of the honestly a previous reviewer had it right when she commented the designs are made for skinny women who like to show off this targeted demographic isn t a problem but this is definitely not a book for every woman and if i had children i wouldn t give it to my daughters as inspiration for art projects also there are zero actual pictures in the book and relatively little instruction there is one color drawing of each design so of course it looks great and a cursory explanation of how it was created i think this book might be more appropriate for someone who has some creative sewing juices but needs a little extra help thinking of unique designs to create and someone who is not afraid to show off 
make it stop trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether i like it or not and if i like it there most certainly is not a bitter end i gave up on this one literally halfway through part of me wanted to finish it because i had gotten so far into it but i gave up and said enough this book has so many elements repeating from many other koontz books thus it felt like a retread i did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger i wasn t impressed by his perfect adorable wife and children or his career as an author of horror fiction and the afterword by the author seemed smug i m sorry i read so much of it before i stopped but better late than never 
slow going smith s book is a classic and it is cheap so those are some benefits however the book is poorly organized it does not give you a clear outline in each chapter and instead bounces around a little too much the most frustrating part of the book is smith s clear intention to make all the religions seem as similar as possible therefore i think he sometimes does not give a clear picture but instead describes the lowest common denominator finally some knowledge of christianity will be helpful in reading this book he uses allusions from the bible in every chapter 
what is truth the author of this book states that ellen g white spiritualized away christ s second coming i would like for him to give chapter and verse for that because she was looking for his literal return just like every other millerite and seventh day adventist she often refered to it as the blessed hope if this author is wrong about that what else is he wrong about christ said few there be that find it study carefully a good kjv bible and use a good concordance and study history read the books of daniel and revelation side by side along with everything christ said about his second coming and prophecy including false prophets and you can t go wrong every word of god is pure with a prayer asking god for understanding he will guide anyone the bible explains and defines itself man doth not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the one star rating i have given is too high but there was no lower rating available 
it s the one book i couldn t get through i read halldor laxness independent people and loved it so much that i ordered all the out of print books by him i could find and the atom station conveniently in print and available through amazon books i hated quotstationquot i put it down of the way through and have felt no need to pick it up this is the first time i can remember doing this in a lifetime of compulsive reading laxness experimented with a new style in this one demonstrating that experiments sometimes fail i found his parody obnoxious his politics overwhelming the characters unengaging and the tone of the book irritating i gave it a quotquot because its not pulp it s intelligent original unusual maybe someone will like it he s really a great writer ! 
for the rich and dedicated deals mostly with higher demominations of chips many people like myself collect as we travel and only collect chips 
slow wordy i really liked the first one and even went to my mom s house to pick up the second one this at at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page not much has happened to make me want to finish it very boring not really into roz and mitch characters i don t think they are very well developed they seem kind of blah and the story is kind of blah blah blah blah and just words for the blah blah blah going on and on 
yes it did have some humorous remarks since i ve read and enjoyed an earlier book by these authors why men don t listen and women can t read maps i didn t hesitate to grab this one off the shelves what a waste of money ! they just repeat a lot that was said in the book i already had also of all the facts that are stated i know for sure that at least three of them are total fiction or at best hearsay these are the only three where i m an expert which seriously makes me doubt the validity of the remaining facts i found this book a very irritating read 
confusing ann an aspiring writer knew of lucy an aspiring poet when the two of them were students at the same college actually everyone knew of lucy she was the one who d had cancer as a child and whose chemotherapy treatments had left her with a severely disfigured face that continued to need surgery after surgery until the end of her life lucy was mistreated by her peers when she was a child but it seemed that for the rest of her life everyone was trying to make up for that cruelty she was cheered for and spoken to warmly wherever she went despite the fact that she seemed to have few redeeming qualities that would make her so popular even ann admits that she followed the gossip about lucy s medical condition and she felt close to her even when lucy had no idea who ann was ann couldn t be more delighted when lucy decides to move in with her after college she continues to be thrilled and grateful for the rest of lucy s life as lucy drifts through existence needing constant reassurance that people loved her that she was beautiful and talented she also needs money and someone to clean her apartment and someone to do her bidding after her surgeries that person is always ann who seems to simply accept that this is the way their relationship should be i was confused how could an intelligent educated person allow herself to be treated so poorly what was ann getting out of this relationship that i couldn t see or was it simply that she befriended someone prone to depression and suicide attempts so she felt she couldn t drop lucy without putting her life in danger ann is a much better friend than i could ever imagine being i would have stopped speaking to lucy after about the fiftieth page 
oh the things he doesn t need to share this is not al s best work it s more rambling than usual and not so pithy i got it for cheap and got enough laughs to justify my purchase 
interesting theory circular logic i ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest tipler s theory of immortality in a nutshell is the following the planet earth and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in billion years man will make self learning and self replicating machines can windows xp do that that will colonize over millions of years our galaxay and eventually the entire universe these machines will be capable of individual thoughts emotions etc and are essentially alive as the universe begins to collapse the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe all the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one super being at the center of the collapsing universe this super being is the omega point the omega point via its all knowledge of all things will be able make emulations exact duplicates of all biospheres including earth within these emulations individual humans you and me will be emulated thus we will again be alive as these beings in these emulations will be unable to tell if they re real or virtual prestoimmortality for all the book theory reeks of circular logic and assumptions it s an interesting theory but it s just that an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist ps tipler denies the resurection of christ and in the last chapter admits to being an aetheist i wonder if he s a god fearing aetheist 
the victorians a densely packed book with many bits of interesting information but terribly organized and loaded with names places institutions not properly identified that are complete blanks to a non english historian a great disappointment 
some useful information but disappointing on the whole i m a big fan of dan poynter s book the self publishing manual so i expected that this book would be of comparable quality unfortunately that just isn t the case there is some information relating to the new book model publication process that should be helpful but what little information exists is difficult to extract from this book which has been very poorly designed and laid out the pages are constantly broken by quotes that loosely relate to the text and this makes it difficult for the actual content to read smoothly the text itself seems disjointed as if poynter has just copied and pasted passages of previous articles together and little attention has been paid to making this a coherent and informative book the graphics used in the book are of poor quality an obvious example of someone who doesn t know how to prepare graphics for print and an indication that this book was just slapped together i hope this isn t what dan poynter means by the new book model as this was an incredibly disappointing book both aesthetically and as a text while i think electronic publishing is a medium that s here to stay and incredibly valuable i do disagreee with dan poynter s assertion in this book that the only ink onpaper dead tree books in the future will be coffee table books books as an art form these books will be used to decorate homes and offices other information will be disseminated electronically without sacrificing trees certainly this will never happen as long as new book model publishers publish books of this quality consumers will demand books of greater informational value that present the information in an easy toabsorb and attractive manner which i m disappointed to discover dan poynter is willing to sacrifice in any case the fact is there are actually more trees growing in the united states now as a result of our vast use of paper and lumber than there were years ago the save the trees argument for e publishing is just wrong there are a lot of good reasons to e publish but trees aren t among them it s worth noting that far fewer trees would have died in the printing of this book had the author left out the exessive quotes and textboxes that pad this book s page countall in all i m disappointed with writing nonfiction the information in this book that is of any value really belongs in poynter s infinitely better and more comprehensive book the self publishing manual one chapter would cover it i also recommend avery cardoza s the complete guide to successful publishing 
with whom has he been interviewing i did not count but it did not seem as though i read answers but fewer in many years of working and interviewing more lately than formerly i encountered perhaps of the questions in today s market it seems interviewers are looking for evidence of directly applicable and detailed skills especially technical and hard ones for comfort with the candidate for evidence of being quick adapting well and for initiative and solid achievement the questions are mildly contrived and i have not been asked more than about at any time in my longish career possibly because he covers so many which are illegal or too personally probing in this litigous era 
boooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggggg inticing beginning but quickly drops off into the most dull details of useless information even the ending was dull and in my opinion and unfinished 
the blind will lead the blind and both will fall into the ditch he bowed at a shinto shrine he attends the pagan rite at bohemian grove for the cremation of care he belongs to the order of death also known as skull and bones his wife says he milks male horses and that she enjoys male dancers only the blind could think this is a description of a bible believer 
all you need to know about this book finishing this book was a lesson in patience don t bother with this waste of paper there are many other fine writers of christian leaning gkchesterton and t seliot come to mind who can write without egregious fallacies first ravzac asserts that his book counters the steady barrage of scholarly attack which has been foisted upon religion in general and on christianity in particular p xiv paradoxically he then goes on to quote kant s assurance as representative of modern antitheistic thought p that spirituality is not threatened by kant s antitheistic philosophies and also acknowledges that modern thought has been a natural evolution of human history p second ravzac continually correlates societal ills with modern intellectualism p xiv xviiet al and actually asserts causality between the two p xvii then he states that every generation raises the issue of life s essence and discusses the long history of humanity s existential angst if dissatisfaction with life is universal in all times and places and if the history of humanity is the history of pleasure as well as pain then where does ravzac get off when he tries to pin it all on modern intellectualism and philosophy finally he states that all philosophizing on life s purpose is ultimately two conclusions does god exist and what is his character p he may hold such a view however he seems to be ignoring a vast record of philosophy that does not presuppose a theistic view let alone the monotheistic variant ravzac is atrociously unrigorous in his sophomoric attempt at conversing with the great philosophers the foregoing should show that one needn t get very far into his book before being stumbled at his profusion of ineptitude the entire writing has so borrowed pseudo biblical language as to be cloying and ravzac thoroughly conveys his paranoid rhetoric by overutilizing key words such as warned aberrant terrifying unbridled unleashed attacks machinations trickery etc ad nauseum in short this book is the religious version of political paranoia as discussed in richard hofstadter s the paranoid style in american politics there are no redeeming features of this writing save for giving the lucid reader abundant opportunities to identify logical fallacies and monitoring the addled ramblings of today s christian writers 
self focused marketing in action even though don peppers and martha rodgers have seized and even created opportunities to promote crm and to marketing this book provides no true thought leadership the only redeemable aspect of the writing are some real world high level examples of proactive customer relationship building not anything extraordinary but enough from some large company top execs to get an understanding that a customer focused business can only be successful if the culture is nutured from the top down the book does one thing very well it promotes future peppers and rodgers writings that hopefully have more pratical application the fact that the authors ask the readers to send their thoughts and ideas on specific topics to unique addresses of the to peppers and rodgers web site definitely follows the crm philosophy not to mention gives them a bank of real world experience to draw from for their next project i recommend looking elsewhere for any quotreal meat quot relevant to crm strategy lessons 
a real stink bomb i can t believe i wasted as much time as i did on this book this is perhaps one of the worst slap togetherastory jobs in recent publication i was looking for a slice of ny life and what i got was no big apple just a rotten apple does anyone want to buy my copy only about read and slightly vomit stained 
lazy and lame book i ordered this based largely on the concept which seemed like a book on gay history that was much needed to fill in the gaps instead the book comes off as if kaiser got a nice advance and then needed to submit some kind of manuscript but he had lots of other things to do so he did the absolute minimal amount of new research instead he relies heavily on taped interviews with or gay men to fill out the pages the chapter on the s one of the most important decades in gay history has nothing more than former bartenders saying that the mineshaft was wild man and a politico friend of his talking about how he semi came out of the closet no sense of the gay metropolis here just a random series of unconnected anecdotes i hope he got a nice advance but this book isn t really worth actually buying just check it out at the library in all its dismalness and see for yourself 
too good to pass up and also useful this book is an enormously easy fun read as a side benefit it will improve your grasp of the english language i liked it so much that i bought an electronic version for my pda so i ll always have it handy everyone needs it 
the longest test prep for the ap eh the review is too detailed to be a review if i wanted to retake the euro course i would suggest this book moreover the practice tests are extremely different than the actual ap test making the six practice exams effectively useless 
let s get real this is the kind of art that show me the power of fiction over reality why did he use those sizes wow ! did you see them i do have fantasies but come on ! let s get real real guys with real dimensions no more no less that s the beauty of life 
mark s standard handbook for mechanical engineers i have a slightly older copy and i have found that for the pe exam this is a good reference however if you are doing something in the real world the machinery s handbook is far better this book gives good overviews of a huge variety of topics that any mech engr might need but not much depth it is about as much information as a manager might want to know 
too graphic too long to get somewhere this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
not what it appears to be the play into the woods not only contains sinister elements but has an overall dark message to convey it preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine it teaches is that lying stealing cheating and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one s perspective on life also that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you this religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs 
way too general this dictionary may be good for the layman but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer only the most common legal words are included so most of the words are familiar to lawyers those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included i would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms but not to a lawyer or law student 
less than expected some very basic information provided regarding natural hair not what i expected from the book 
civilized discourse leaves discontented reader there isn t much i can add to previous reviews of civilziation and its discontents my own reaction after cracks at it one in college and one post is one of bafflement and boredom with academic convoluted language freud discusses the role of the individual with his neuroses and his conflicts with socialization and civilization many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers rousseau for example his psychological conclusions have more or less been explored at length in his previous works therefore the redeeming value is found perhaps in freud s closing passages eery portends of europe s ugly years 
it upset my mother i bought this book for my mother who is currently battling ovarian cancer i bought it to inspire her and let her know that there are survivors out there well the introduction was written to dramatize the book it went on and on about how few people survive ovarian cancer not true and what a miracle it was that the writer survived consequently my mother got extremely depressed she never read the whole book because the introduction upset her so much 
hey i ve got a great idea the da vinci code is a worldwide phenomenon staying on the new york times bestseller list for over years i think i ll throw together a quicky book with some alternate intepretations of biblical history that i got from looking up websites with google one weekend i ll slap the name da vinci code in the title of my book and market it to delusional paranoids who spend every waking minute thinking about how the arts and entertainment world is at war with christianity i ll make a forture off someone else s success it sure beats working for a living god bless americ 
don t all religions lead to god this book implies that the reader will learn about other religions but brings few facts or new information to the reader the content is quite shallow our small group is quite disappointed in this selection and would not purchase another from this series 
find no secrets here a monster book of pages proof that eco s editor was already dead or the book killed him it is filled with lots of esoteric knowledge and history be advised that the translator william weaver does not translate the chapter headings nor the majority of foreign dialogue is he assuming that we read french or would want to the inclusion of drawings does not advance the story and you wonder why they were included they are there possibly solely to annoy the reader eco makes the reader feel uneducated by using words and terms no one ever heard before let alone want to use and the story suddenly becomes the italian version of john knowles a separate peace and with this transformation the hunt for the plan or the templars secret is just a red herring the story is not about these long dead french knights as eco uses s lsd induced stream of consciousness writing style for the last pages he leads his main character to the zen taoi ching conclusion that watching his friend be murdered is all for the best perhaps eco should take his own character s advice and ma gavte la nata and take the cork out 
influential but flawed this book has many biases and flaws other reviewers have already gone into detail on these points so i won t belabor them i gave this book stars because it created huge waves when released was the subject of many magazine articles and television shows in the following months so if you are like me and enjoy keeping on top of books that have helped shape the news note that this was one of the most most talked about books of that being said my other point is this there is a business in making people scared and prophesizing doom and gloom does a woman s fertility decline as she ages sure but it varies wildly from person to person do you really want to put your money towards trying to scare the wits out of high acheiving north american women making them feel even more pressured than they already do i for one would rather not 
beautiful beginning painful illogical ending i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction if thoughts are that powerful they need to be resrained earlier i don t know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive logic can be quite painful when left alone but sometimes it has to be 
waste of time money the book is full of useless fillings finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations it also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics determing how the color reflect against your skin after reading the book i still don t know what my colors are besides with so many different color hues on the market how can one tell if what you re buying is an ever green or true green for example confusing the lack of pictures showing the types of collars they re recommending for different body types eg mandarincollar cowlbardotis annoying to say the least questionnaires are poorly structured the section on makeup underwear accessories is trivial save your money im glad the book i read was a borrow from the library and save your time pass 
historically significant but that s about it i gave this book stars because it is historically significant to understand the thinking of the gender feminists of the s i also found the discussion of the equality feminists from the s to be interesting the right to vote for women was of course important as were several other causes that the equality feminists fought for i rated this book low because the author attempts to explain the housewife phenomenon but ends up overgeneralizing and trying to speak for all women the author is very snobby and self rightous thinking she is able to determine which women are really fulfilled and living their life to it s fullest potential the ideas in this book are what caused people like my mother to talk negatively about dumb housewives and to eat their words when their own children such as myself grew up and became housewives or what we now call stay at home moms which i might add was mostly fueled by watching my workaholic mother who i do love very much who didn t seem to enjoy anything in life except work fortunately we can teach our biased and prejudiced mothers that some women really do get fulfillment from raising their own children homesi am only going to touch on some of the ridiculous arguments in this book because there are too many to list ms friedan gives evidence that children in other s care actually turn out better than those raised by their mothers great so she was teaching a generation of women that they are better off working than caring for their own children that other people can do a better job than they can what a vote of confidence the author goes on and on about how mothers were smothering their children and this is why many turned to a life of the feminine mystique sorry but a s mom with children and a lack of modern conveniences did not have time to smother her children basic care for as many children as women had in the s would consume most of a mother s time if you want to see parents who overwhelm their children with attention and material goods and live vicariously thru them look around in according to the research and i use this term lightly because someone as depressed as ms friedan must have had trouble seeing the happiness in others in this book you are either working mother mentally stable able to do household tasks in lightning speed and raise completely competent children educated housewife most likely on drugs and or are alcoholic are so depressed you contemplate suicide have dysfunctional children and a husband who is trying to get away from your sexual advances uneducated housewife content with life because you are a complete idiot ms friedan completely ignores that there were and there still are a significant percentage of women who want to be at home caring for their families and homes i m sure there were millions of women who were benefitted by being emancipated from their homes that is good that they were happier with more choices however ms friedan should have encouraged them to do this without dragging millions of other women thru the mud with her chapter on the sexual sell i m glad that she figured out people make money thru advertising by manipulating people advertisers manipulate everyone not just women and i am sure the thingbuying housewife of the s was nothing like the guilt ridden working or stay at home mom today who s child has so many toys he she doesn t know what to do except claim im bored due to being so overwhelmed p ms friedan quotes someone who says to make one half the human race consume its energies in the functions of housekeeper wife and mother is a monstrous waste of the most precious material god ever made the fact that ms friedan would even give credit to this comment by citing it in her book speaks volumes about her mentality when i thought the ideas in this book couldn t get any more rediculous ms friedan started talking about homosexuality the feminine mystique is driving men to be gay ! men are so repulsed by their over controlling wives and mothers that they are turning against women and turning homosexual ! also ms friedan thinks housewives are sex crazed zombies in search of any man and finally this comment i am convinced there is something about the housewife state itself that is dangerous in a sense that is not as far fetched as it sounds the women who adjust as housewives who grow up wanting to be just a housewife are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camp is this woman serious this stuff is so warped i can hardly put it into words ! it is my opinion that this author was extremely depressed and or had psychological problems was insanely jealous of happy wives mothers 
too difficult to obtain these superfoods i find that it wil not only be a big hassle which is to be expected but also expensive and too difficult to find these superfood 
boring the research was remarkable almost a minute byminute description of george s daughters never did i think that research could result in a book so boring dare i admit the entire work was not read my eyes kept going cross eyed from all the minutia ms fraser offered not to mention the swarms of characters active in the princesses lives that appeared and disappeared just as quickly how happy i was that this book was borrowed from the library it would have been dreadful to have spent the money for such a disappointing effort detail can be wonderful in this case it was overkill 
that s it ms steel is truly the queen of repition she needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor i see that is the ongoing critism of her books i swore i was never going to read another of her soaps i can t stand those either but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good i ll stick with the authours i know i like from now on and i hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite exquisitely she has worn these out but she s laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
not fun activities and it falls apart i bought this for my daughter thinking there would be actual activities i was way wrong there are different things to look at and point out but not any kind of games or learning activites other then pointing to blue and red also the pages are thin and it is spiral bound so my month old has now destroyed about half the book i would go for something else 
too primitive the disigns elements were too rustic for my taste i was looking for more of a casual elegence 
okay but there are better books out there if you get this book do so for one of two reasons you want entertaining tidbits about weird stuff you already own everything else randi s writtenthis book simply pales in comparison the the skeptic s dictionary available free online when it comes to debunking a wide range of paranormal claims in fact i m not sure if there s any good debunking in there if you want to read about the akashic memory and various forms of flat earthism this books if for you i suppose its nice to have someone who can provide entertaining tidbits in a non credulous manner but i wonder it would be better just to buy a believer s encyclopedia and ignore the fact that the author believes the things he s talking about 
lacks detail and helpful tips this is not one of lonely planet s best guides there is suprisingly little information for example the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services basically everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in rekyavik which luckily is run very well i found this really disappointing since iceland is very expensive and i was hoping to keep down costs in reality this is almost impossible even eating at the grocery store i was spending dollars a meal for bread and cheese furthermore iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details as with any tour book some of the info is out of date some of the museums and businesses were closed including the icelandic phallogical museum it also seemed that this book was written for the high season in the summer months i went in march and found the information on the offseason limited and sometimes inaccurate i usually trust lonely planet but in this case i would have tried one of the other guide book companies or simply visit the tourist center when you get there 
shame on lesko i found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop ! what i did find interesting is that vickie adkins marcum seems to review all of matthew lesko s books of course vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as quotkudos to matthew lesko ! he s making this world a better place quot for those of you who are a little slow let me inform you that vickie adkins marcum is really matthew lesko or someone matthew gave this review to and paid vickie to post it it s strange that vickie s reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout it is also strange that vickie only reviews matthew s books shame on you matthew lesko for writing your own review 
there is a problem the problem is if you are not familiar with th century irish history you will be lost reading this book when part ends doyle provides the reader with no historical background and writes the book assuming that the reader is all ready well versed in irish history i also had trouble visualizing ireland the places buildings streets and the battle scenes which i attribute to doyle s lack of description and to my lack of irish knowledge 
bad really bad when i started reading this book i was reminded of the excellent silverberg s little novel quotthe world inside quot however a few more pages into oath of fealty and i had a shallow epidermic cardboard story that reads like a tv mini series stay away at all costs 
more government propaganda we can add this book to the numerous articles done by cnn abc and nbc and the many other government mouthpieces that have given us plenty of sensationalism and quotflexible facts quot and biased hype but very little truth hard core facts and the undeniable evidence that points to a larger conspiracy and a huge government cover up just like the networks the authors of the book put forth only what the government wants the masses to see you don t get the facts when you read this book people you get fantasy fiction if you want facts i suggest you visit the official oklahoma city bombing investigation team s website oklahoma state representative charles key has done a wonderful job investigating the bombing and his final report provides us with the evidence that didn t make it to trial the numerous eyewitnesses who were not called to testify despite the important events they witnessed on april mcveigh was not the lone bomber and anyone who thinks so just does not have the facts at hand get them put this work of fiction down and honor the victims of the okc bombing by seeking the truth 
only star i simply could not get into this book maybe i am being picky but why do words have to be italizied in every paragraph 
my first and last kinsey milhone debacle it s tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how bad it truly is but ms grafton has somehow earned a following and as i ve said before there is something for everyone out there after all some people not a majority actually voted for george w bush on purpose ! i think this level of mystery fluff is for them rather than spoil the nutty climax i have worked in hospitals for years so i ain t buying it i will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words life is one big savage joke not funny ha ha but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began i became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began where did they go to kindergarten that i almost missed the rest of the chapter 
more fiction than fact a wasted ot money this is a book for a novice as no serious student of john brown would consider the author has done any serious research it s garbage reynolds states john brown killed proslavery people this is not true the testimony of the victims disprove that the testimony shows john brown murdered northern people while he and his men acted like southern people trying to put the blame on southern people john brown did not kill a single slaveowner in his murderous rampage here is a quote from a serious researched book on john brown some people believe john brown is a hero after the event below john brown and his gang would ride to four more houses continuing their slaughter a hero quoting directly from otto scotts book sourced below the night was hot and humid the river was not far away the doyle family was asleep as the men approached their cabin two bulldogs rushed out barking two of the men stopped and slashed one to death with their sabers the other dog fled howling and the family awoke the men knocked heavily on the door and james doyle swung out of bed what is it he called what way to the wilkinson place a man s voice answered doyle opened the door saying he would tell them and was almost knocked off his feet when several men rushed in shouting were the northern army ! surrender ! mahala doyle clutched her youngest a girl and began to stammer hush mother hush said james doyle his three sons moved beside him william twenty two drury twenty and hon fourteen the men pushed doyle and then the two eldest sons out the door mahala doyle began to weep but when they reached for the fourteen yearold she sprang out of bed and clutched him not him oh god not him the old man in the light jacket leather tie and farmer s straw hat his face as thin and stern as an ax punched the boy back and the men left slamming the door mahala doyle clutched john and listened her eyes wide the men stopped their prisoners about two hundred yards from the doyle cabin the leader placed his revolver against doyle s forehead and pulled the trigger as coolly as a man shooting a lame horse that set them off one in a frenzy stabbed doyle s corpse with his saber william doyle was stabbed in the face slashed over the head and shot in the side drury broke and ran in the darkness was pursued and overtaken near a ravine he put his arms up to ward off their blows but the men bearded burley and in a near frenzy hacked at him with their sabers his fingers and then his arms were cut off his head was cut open and he was stabbed in the chest they continued to hack after he fell and after he was dead he had frightened them he might have escaped the wilkinson cabin was next sourcethe secret six john brown and the abolitionist movement otto scott copyrightp p cf howard report appendix ex parte testimony villard op cit p james c malin john brown and the legend of fifty six philadelphia the american philosophical society p dr malin who explored john brown s career in kansas with thoroughness that has enraged propagandists especially marxists ones quotes george grant a young settler who knew that brown boys saw them leave on their murder mission and spoke that brown shot doyle but personally did nothing more end quote ive read several books on john brown and the secret six john brown and the abolitionist movement otto scott is imho the best one ever printed 
not very good this book would be for any girl that hasn t been on a date i ve been on many dates so this wasn t helpful to me at all 
my first review this is my first review for amazon i write this so that some reader can avoid the pain i suffered the book was the worst mystery i have ever read wild plot twists have been mentioned by others nonsensical plot twists are a better description i found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason i finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half this book was factually wrong in so many ways here are a few the prices listed were off college professors held office hours late on friday afternoons someone was paid with dollar bills i will give away one plot twist someone has been stealing rare books for months someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book the brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder i would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents from discovering the youthful indecretion 
character loyalty commitment aban uses the words character loyalty commitment throughout this book obviously this is a clear case of do as i say not as i do mr webster define s hypocrite as one who pretends to be pious virtuous etc without really being so how many time will they change the color of his shirt on this book s cover 
mr poynter this is unfortunate i am a fan of dan poyter s and i have learned a lot from this author s monumental work the self publishing manual i thought this title writing nonfiction turning thoughts into books is another one of such great works i was so disappointed while reading this book when i realized that it was nothing but a rehash of the original book i just could not understand how a professional author could have the audacity to publish the same book under two different titles and sell both to the same audience i don t know if you get i just don tto make matters worse this title is not as detailed as the original work so if you are interested in learning from this man i suggest that you get a copy of the self publishing manual rather than this one i gave this book star not because it does not contain useful information but because it contains nothing new from the author s previous publication it is really unfortunate i felt cheated 
frustrating for little fingers we bought this book for our year old daughter and even i had trouble putting the valentines into the slots the valentine was not very durable and was starting to rip already after the first time we read it together i was very disappointed and returned the book it was not up to sesame street standards try elmo loves you instead 
don t waste your time and money this book is neither good contents nor sharp predicts what is this book i think it is just garbage if you want get more information for your future life and your future business it is better that you need to read toefler s work the revolutionary wealth naisbitt is not present man any more he is the past man 
bait amp switch as a raw foodist i hoped this book would help me sort out fact from fiction about cooked vs raw providing me with ammo for the many food critics i encounter but joe alexander in an extremely clumsy writing style not only made the book a challenge to finish but often diverted from the subject at hand i m sure tibetan rejuvenation exercise rites are valuable as are rebirthing breathing techniques but that s not what the book title suggests 
really not much here sue grafton has written many good books but this one is weak weak weak try a is for alibi or j is for judgement they show off grafton s writing talents much better 
horrible textbook reads like a dictionary each page is nothing more than bullet points that alternate between definitions and corollaries proofs are typically very short explained and illustrated in no more than a quarter of a page more appropriate as a reference manual than a textbook for a class 
strangely put together while i found a lot of the material in the book very interesting it is put together in such a muddled way that it is very difficult enjoy reading it the book seems to be composed of a number of previously written and in many cases overlapping articles joined together with fairly boring filler to try and present a complete view i would suggest buying the book if you re interested in reading about early colonial life in the vanilla industry in papantla mexico most of the other information can be easily found on the internet 
uncle isaac asimov tells it as it is after the s this play fell into obscurity it was later revived in the mid s its period of obscurity does not surprise me believe me i am a champion for shakespeare s underrated timon of athens and coriolanus i honestly tried to like this play but i was forced to concur with the great isaac asimov who said though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies it is indeed rather an unpleasant play well onto the play we meet the widowed countess her son bertram and the elder lafew we learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal possibly helena s father could have cured the king but alas he is dead the countess gives bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice polonius gave ophelia though the bumbling polonius ends up being easier to like helena loves bertram but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity one comical moment is when parolles reveals that in a way virginity is a form of vain self love later helena cures the king and helena asks for bertram as a husband now this is where i have a problem bertram is made out to be a villain but how can we possibly not sympathize with him maybe helena deserves something for saving the king but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who doesn t like her well bertram is forced to go through with the marriage but he quickly decides to help florence against siena poor parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play this is where i have another problem rather than the clever misunderstandings of the comedy of errors the clever marital confrontations and errors in midsummer night s dream or the comical and clever passages from jaques in as you like it the comedy in alls well that ends well is reduced to the lowest possible form flat out ridicule ! it is interesting that in the word ridicule we have the letters for cruel but i am digressing in one decent elemenet of comedy bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife and perhaps in time bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage it wouldn t be unheard of one interesting thing is that bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not ravish helena he doesn t love her and therefore will not engage in sex it is rather repulsive on his mother s part how she fails to understand the situation even if she was on helena s side she might at least understand bertram s frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage and possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution but no she just rants and raves later the countess reads a letter from helena stating that she will leave so bertram can come home from the war this throws bertram s mother into yet another rage on helena s behalf and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with helena that is until our good old uncle isaac asimov points out the hypocrisy of helena helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be she does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband well onward in florence helena meets with diana whom bertram loves and helena thinks she can trick bertram into making her pregnant we then have the cruel practical joke on parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets to friendly forces of course or else perhaps even shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has parolles say who can not be crushed with a plot we also see bertram try to win the affections of diana diana of course feels nothing for bertram but again the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent if we accept the fact that bertram should respect diana s wishes that she doesn t love him how do we account for the fact that helena imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram but of course diana consents to meet bertram and of course it will really be helena who meets him but even tricking bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home now in much ado about nothing hero had a valid excuse for staging her death she was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of but helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram and she still wants a sympathy party one redeeming element of the play is that lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced parolles and offers him a job and of course in the end bertram feels bad over helena s staged death and is happy to see her alive again helena may very well be the britney spears of shakespeare s characters 
sooo slow one word boring this book took pages just to describe people dying everywhere and that the remaining survivors ended up in a hall together after that no zombie killing action for the next pages or so all of it went something like this we were all scared we didn t know what to do michael showed signs of irritation at the group s indecisiveness how could dead bodies move some of us wanted to leave others wanted to stay here the whole world was coming to an end way too much imagery about their surroundings and emotions but not enough horror element to warrant this as a horror novel makes a good read for people who just want to throw away their time at amateur work that offers nothing particularly interesting the spotlight review written by citymars is yet another testimony to the points i m trying to make if you really like this or want to see for yourself what i meant you can download a free ebook version at david moody s website other titles that are actually worth reading are the rising by brian keene and the walking dead series by robert kirkman 
brain dead main character kills story this book was simply not up to baldacci s usual quality the story goes all over the place but doesn t get anywhere until the last pages even after and even pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going i don t mind suspense but you can stay suspended only so long until it becomes boredom the main character is the worst one baldacci has ever created one minute she is crying her eyes out and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept fbi agents and police this is repeated throughout the story i would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book she makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers by the end of the book i found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid off this is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping 
iran this book began to contradict on matter of king of kings ismail in one chapter author wrote that king ismail was a great king and was the best thing happened to iran the following chapter the author illustarted king ismail as a burtail king of iran 
disappointing the christian life should be one of honesty with ourselves with our communities and with the world all too often it isn t and steven james target is a good one sadly this book is both overwritten and repetitive and remarkably self involved difficult to recommend 
very basic info wow this basically boiled down to a waste of about of the book s purchase price before you buy beware this would probably be a good book for you if you are just out of school or are just getting started in quotthe biz quot however as an experienced musician who thought this title might provide some helpful marketing tips and ideas i was very disappointed its extremely basic also weissman s idea of what constitutes a local music market seems to be off as well i would consider boston or portland or any of these cities major metropolitan areas not just new york la nashville and chicago at least chapters are wasted on the history of the music scenes of some cities including those i just mentioned how is this important to you if you live in a small metropolitan area such as harrisburg where i m at also as a former boston resident i don t think weissman really does the city s scene justice major acts besides new kids on the block have been broken out of beantown look no farther than the mighty mighty bosstones or aerosmith however there was some interesting albeit vague info about the union grants and artist in residence programs i would think that someone with the qualifications of weissman would be able to offer much more specified info instead of vague statements such as quottry to set up a meeting with the creative director of an ad agency quot but then again maybe its supposed to be more of an overview kinda book if you re just getting started this might be a good book for you if you re out there doing it full time look elsewhere there s not much i got out of this book 
disappointed i don t know whats going on in the art quilt world these days but it seems to me that the more you can change the structure of the fabric the more chance you have to get into a venue like this these quilts pretty much all look alike to me and it appears to me that the artists have qualified for this venue by slopping dropping and plopping as much gunk on the fabric as it can hold there is more to art quilting than surface design ! i do have to say that there are some truely breathtaking works in this book but over all i was extremely disappointed there is more to art quilting than pure abstraction and embellishment 
the face is ugly i m trying to remember what made me pick up this book i know i wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the face was so bad it took me a month to finish it i literally had to force myself to read it the writing is vintage koontz to the extreme koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example i call it diarrhea spell check i respect koontz for example odd thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick demented killer thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive the boy lives in the end a good pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent my advice is skip this one i would love to know if mr koontz is being paid by the page the face makes me wonder 
full of perhaps and maybes admittedly i wasn t reading this book for pleasure as i had to read it for a class but it is very poor indeed okay i m not a phd historian like bennett but that shouldn t mean my criticism is invalid the book is an interesting concept trying find out what a peasant s life was like but is just full of perhaps she did this and maybe she did that bennett in reality is writing a book about the medieval peasantry trying to make it interesting and accessible to college students by making the book revolve around a character however the book proves condescending and left me very frustrated as a slammed the book shut on the final page here are a few examples i felt as if cecilia was demanding that i write her life p and regarding the doodle in the court records if cecilia is the woman shown in this drawing we can surmise that she was tall thin curly headed and perhaps the bearer of a prominent nose p as with many other textbooks for college this was too expensive for only pages and should be the it is in the marketplace not the that my bookstore was charging the unfortunate truth is that it will be very difficult to ever know what life was like for the average medieval peasant since they did not write anything and bennett s account seems to add no real value to this subject area and the story of cecilia penifader could have easily been summarized on a page or two 
dont waste your kids time i recently read this book for a elan class uga i thought it was terrible and pointless the characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for th or th graders the book was around pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time my professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes she claimed i was scared to read books to my kids i guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book she is absolutely right i am terrified to read bad books to my students 
i haven t drunk the kool aid meaning i am not enamored of this book it was overlong silly poorly written repetitive it had cardboard characters and was nothing but a soap opera which happened to be set in early th century japan to top it off the sex scenes were gruesome and boring i was hoping this book was better than the movie which i saw first but it wasn t also why glorify the lives of women who were basically just high priced prostitutes who sold their virginity and selves to the highest bidder real japanese culture could never be as dull as this book 
dissapointed i was very dissapointed by this book but maybe it s because i love bright vibrant colors traci uses dirty muddy colors and i think this book looks like it came out years ago its too messy for me 
light overview there s a lot of fluff and useless opinions littered through out the book some references to researched material were made but the author didn t expand on them too much for a person who had never done any reading on this subject matter will find this very easy to read and will have a general understand of what book they should buy next for the rest of us that demand more this book doesn t cut it 
bloodless and draining this book should have been better its a comprehensive collection of journaling ideas but the final effect is bloodless and draining sadly the author saves significant journal writing examples for a final section and uses quotes instead of examples in the chapters perhaps she s trying not to sway the reader as to a preferred type of writing but it also doesn t impart much energy or passion go back to quotthe new diary quot or quotone to one quot or go forward to quotleaving a trace quot this one isn t worth the effort 
oj should hire posner this book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the warren commission posner saw an opportunity to take their money and he took it good for him i m sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe oj was innocent he d write that book too with all sorts of convincing scientific evidence take a look at weisberg s case open if you can find it for documentation of some of posner s more amusing misrepresentations 
hollow and offputting when the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as hannah musgrave is in the darling the book is not worthy of completing 
a doctrinaire view of biology most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page the books of richard dawkins whom rose selects as his special target illustrate this well readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain how one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in rose s book there is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists opinions but almost no observations from behavioural biology nonetheless in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments dismissing dawkins and daniel dennett as people who either no longer do science or never did it what a pity therefore that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book there are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave and that s about it 
well documented but highly slanted mcmaster has taken upon himself the task of blaming the civilian leadership in the u s for the disaster in vietnam how they misled and lied to the public and ignored the advice of the military that is true but his deliberate slanting of the evidence to prove his point damages what is a well documented interesting book general harkins comes off in this book as a man doing the right job but who was ignored by lodge in fact although he was ignored harkins clearly was pollyanish in saying things were going well when they weren t as the bright shining lie makes clear the countryside was falling to the viet cong during diem s regieme harkins time and did not suddenly happen when diem was overthrown as mcmaster seems to indicate in addition general westmoreland continued the optimistic vein of harkins he ignored the advice of his marine commanders about sending marines into the khe san area and other areas the nva and viet cong were strong and so suffered many losses yet mcmaster doesn t focus on the weakness and bad decisions of westmoreland because the general the only military member that mcmaster severely criticizes is taylor and that is because he sold out to mcnamara in point of fact lemay who comes off relatively well in this book was a nut whose preference was to bomb north vietnam so much we could pave the entire country and then plant a victory flag some victory if you kill all the people the jcs was not united as mcmaster does admit this book is well documented and covers a fascinating topic the deliberate misleading of the american public in vietname however mcmaster s failure to be objective dramatically weakens the book his criticism of mcnamara and johnson is well documented however in his desire to prove his main thesis and i suspect because of his loyalty the military caused mcmaster to gloss over the failure of the jcs and harkins westmoreland and to ignore the fact that rural vietnam was largely lost long before diem s overthrow although not perfect a bright shining lie does a much better job of describing this sorry tale 
iteration reiteration back and forth and back and forth im happy im sad happy sad love him dont love him love him dont blah blah blah we re poor we re not poor we re poor a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas malamuds writing style is easy to slip into and the story is addictive yet annoying any pulp novel can be addictive spoilerhe rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it s ok ! no don t try to sell me any of that oh the author s not giving this his approval no no no when there is nothing to contradict something it s the same as saying it s ok the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me 
typical liberal rhetoric i first read passages from this book in college i can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds professor zinn is a far left author he uses the usual lines america generally bad communism generally good obviously mr zinn has the right to write whatever he wants and his writing style is very convincing however if the reader investigates the facts many holes become visible in his theories those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints a good example is intellectual morons how ideology makes smart people fall for stupid ideas by daniel j flynn which gives the reader a good profile of mr zinn 
remote spewing i first came across the subject of remote viewing one night as i was switching tv channels and found a show about psychic spying imagine my shock when they showed a picture of my own company sri international ! i ve always been interested in anything exploring psychic phenomena but to learn that this type of research was started at my own company in the s was exciting stuff indeed the next day at work i learned there were still people here who remembered this program and the scientist who started it hal putoff not sure of last name spelling some of my coworkers said at the time of the project s heyday they experimented with lots of employees sometimes they d put a bunch of regular folk in a giant room and give them coordinates to see if anyone could view them needless to say scientists are a hard crowd and many found it amusing if not silly physicists i know who worked with dr putoff said the army eventually took over the project this is told in the documentary i mentioned above dr putoff was also interviewed in the tv show and so were many others including some of the remote viewers so i was thrilled when this book psychic warrior was published i had hoped it would have tons of more information about what the project was doing now but then i read it and was utterly disappointed like linus the reviewer above i think this book was poorly written and the author is completely full of himself his constant grandstanding and egomania makes this very hard to get though to the interesting parts about the actual remote viewing also i wonder about how someone can work on a top secret project and then write a tell all book about it perhaps the author made a deal to embellish certain parts of his story so it wouldn t be taken too seriously either way if you think you can wade through all the boring garbage about his home life and how great he is you might possiblly learn a little but i can t recommend this book as a tool to help you get there 
was it worth it i found the book a gathering of days interesting and filled with small pieces of history but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read the format of the book journal entries written by a young girl is neat but her usage of out dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning although this book was directed to a younger audience i believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used if you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the s this book is perfect the story was sweet and descriptive but in my opinion it is a one time around book and did not leave a huge impact on me 
not at all what i expected too boring to go any further than the first several chapters i thumbed through the rest and saw it was all the same not really a personal confessional she mentions her procedures very briefly it instead reads like textbook medical history of the origins of plastic surgery if your anyone who has had or is planning to have any surgery or injections skip this book unless you want to read about soldiers who were disfigured and mamed during war so plastic surgery was born along those same lines i did not want to read in excrutiating detail about the origin of the poison botox and how it was originally found and developed from rotten sausages the stories about people she actually knew are short and so completely off the wall from what any normal woman would ever want to do are useless to read about as well unless you are researching for refrence the statistics and origin of plastic surgery skip this book 
this is not the textbook we thought we had ordered the textbook microeconomics principles problems and policies by mcconnell and brue this book however is selected material from microeconomics the table of contents is the same as the textbook so this is really confusing be sure you get what you want 
a disappointment this attempt to extend a masterpiece of poetic philosophizing on matters a woman ponders at mid life is a whiney and disappointing series of personal complaints in the self congratulatory self pity mode followed by trite self help suggestions at the end of each chapter 
same info is easily available elsewhere on web somewhat useful book in that it pulls together the info that is readily available on the internet particularly from state government websites 
sean hannity should be arrested when the truth about is known he must not escape justice he is a criminal and must be treated like one christian peper 
deliberate misuse of data one example will illustrate how this author knowingly misuses data to mislead his audience he points to the statistical density of los angeles as evidence that density does not provide the benefits typically associated with it less gas use etc in doing so he ignores tha fact that la is built to its perimeter and thus has a high average density compared to many other cities since those cities contain a much denser core surrounded by vast undeveloped areas la s high average density bears little relationship to its lack of localized high densities which are what confer benefits like less gas use breugmann knows this but he chooses to misuse the data to support his own contrarian enterprise and in so doing he gives the sprawl juggernaut one more foot up i personally know sprawl developers who use this intellectually bankrupt book to fight grassroots citizen opposition as apu on the simpsons would say breugmann very bad man he is the no globalwarming scientist for the sprawl set 
incoherant and inconcise using this book as a required text for a brush up seminar course for an mba program i ve found this book did not do enough reviewing for me with regards to creating financial reports income statement statement of cash flows balance sheet etc i had managerial accounting financial accounting and financial management in undergrad however this book still lacks the concrete basics of what goes where on a financial report and why speaking to my undergrad accounting department chair i found my opinion agreed with her s kimmel is verbose and lacks clarity simplicity for those without an accounting focus or background 
mind numbing this is the first book i ever thew in the garbage it was so bad that my teenager and i read parts outloud for laughs here is an example of a perfect phrase on how to break bad news to the boss i just have made what might be a career limiting move 
not what we expected although everyone empathized with june we couldn t understand her loyalty we wished she had been as loyal to aunt peggy there were some readers that didn t finish because they felt the story was going nowhwere then you had those that finished only to be relieved that it was over we hope that june has sought some type of professional counseling behind this because this was not something that you just get over having been rejected by her mother and knowing that it wasn t just her but her white brother and sister too should have made the blow a little easier it s evident that june placed a barrier around herself to shield her feelings as an adult she is a successful lady despite her past and that matters most 
this is only a very short excerpt this is misleading not even of the ruskin masterwork is printed in this book 
if you need a book like this you can do better i have two books currently which are much better than this one i m not really interested in spending the next hour of my life typing up a really exhaustive commentary on this book as this is the first one i ve ever done but i m just hoping to save you some time and money and i feel very strongly this is a bad book and a waste of your efforts it was the required textbook for my print production class and i could ve gotten a better understanding of print production by sniffing the ink on my local newspaper the glossary is substandard the chapters are to say the least hardly informative and the author is often contradictive of his own statements it doesn t seem as though he has an understanding of print production at all i spent days staring at this book wondering why i didn t understand print till i realized it wasn t my brain i had bought a crappy book i won t say some of the elements aren t useful but you d be better off shopping at the used bookstore by my school for example and picking up a used copy for ten bucks there will be plenty there you can get everything useful in this book from the graphics master a much better book or any other print production book try kaj johansen spelling sorry or adobe s print production guide also international paper occassionally prints a guide don t buy this one graphics master seven or eight would be of much more use to you 
not as helpful as i hoped at a risk of offending joseph campbell cultists and fantatics please know that i am both an admirer of joseph campbell and james joyce it was through campbell s praise of joyce s work that help muster the discipline it takes to read joyce i ll give credit where credits due thanks joe now here s my beef i suspect that it s takes a man with a healthy ego and a sense of academic competitiveness to want to incorporate joyce s work into a grand blanket scheme such as joseph campbell did with many of joyce s work i believe ulysses is appropriate enough to enter into a conversation of mythology but finnegans wake no i am not buying it so what is this skeleton s key anyway basically it s a fleshed out version of the outline of chapter contents already provided in the penguin edition of fw which in truth is helpful as a key seamus deane offers an introduction that is as helpful and unhelpful as campbell s so over the odd years since finnegans wake first appeared and not much is known about it perhaps joyce intended just that an enigmatic mystery why try to dismantle a good thing 
has been found recipes dated layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how to is useful its generally from another era bought gourmet cook book instead 
balanced mixture of good and crap ok this book has action however it seemed to me that the action sequences were not written for the readers but rather to satisfy author s need to be tedious and verbose here is a question i want to throw at the people who read this book and gave it more than stars how did the military test supernova to see whether it works or not in the first place before it was stolen i sure as hell would love to know the answer to this question from the readers who are hyping this book and also the author himself this book is trash dump it and move on to the next one on your list 
racist i remember my teacher reading this book to me in the first grade i thought it was the most racist book i had ever seen or heard could not understand why someone would write something like that think it was okay or to read it think there s nothing wrong with it i am a yr old african american woman now i wouldn t dream of reading this to my children because it does not depict true african or african american children it s only a stereotype of how some people who may have some racism in them view us now if you want to read a better version of this story then you should read sam the tigers a retold version of little black sambo written by julius lester 
not one of stuart woods best work i usually enjoy his books even though they are formulaic but this one was so thin in plot it was sad it was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes even these were thin the dialogues were stilted there was no character building if per chance you hadn t read his other books i agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book i don t usually write reviews but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
a monstrous and hilarious botch this stands as a testament to the mediocrity and imbecility of lenin as a philosopher it is a overtly lengthy dull and plodding work lenin demonstrates that he has little of the flair of a born philosopher but the heavyhandedness and arbitrariness of a politician this book which is so antiquated that it now seems unworthy of even academic interest is nothing but a compilation of quatations from previous marxists glossed and re worked to back up official party policy also includes a typically stupid and blustering polemic against the majority of positivists and idealists who are all deemed as quotblockheadsquot only the revelations of marx and engels as lenin seems to think contain the monopoly of infallible truth a laughable example of the dogmatism and intolerance of an ideology upon which was founded a totalitarian darkness that could not maintain itself without resorting to terror persecution assassination sabotage and institutionalised ignorance

futile comingofage tale where the hero learns zilch if tom perrotta meant joe college to be a coming ofage story he fell flat on his face danny the protagonist comes from a working class family and struggles and scrapes his way into yale good for him ! too bad that s not the story by the time we meet danny he s already an ivy leaguer despite his proletariat backstory danny tends to behave just as selfishly and irresponsibly as any of his silver spoon trust fund classmates who i guess we re supposed to think he s better than i don t want to give too much away here so suffice it to say that danny makes one of those big life altering mistakes that any guy can make you know the tried and true premise of the young man with everything going for him who suddenly faces something that threatens to screw up his future does he face it like a man resolve the conflict and grow as a human being nope perrotta lets danny get away with ignoring the serious consequences of his actions and instead focuses on a ridiculous sub plot or was it the main plot i couldn t tell about the mafia and ruthless bodybuilding snack food vendors what s worse danny basically gets a free pass he ignores his self created crisis and it just sort of fades away and once it s gone danny strolls right out and does the same stupid thing he did the first time to get himself in serious trouble lessee a self centered yale student who makes big mistakes screws up other people s lives ignores the consequences shirks responsibility lets other people deal with his mistakes for him and then caps it off by going out partying and acting irresponsibly again psssst mr perrotta that s not the kind of character we root for that s the kind of character we boo and occasionally elect president two stars because joe college despite its flawed premise is pretty readable and provides some insight into the mildly interesting seedy underworld of mobile snack stand vendors 
good plot poorly written almost annoying while black and blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse it is rather difficult to identify with like or even feel anything for the protagonist black and blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband first of all the book seems to me like a lifetime movie almost cheesy if you will half of the things the main character does you are screaming at her in your head to not do them she is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie who runs up the stairs instead of out the door i found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist while i was rooting for her it was because she was the victim not because i actually liked or understood her she seemed weak in that she really didn t do much of anything to help herself or her situation either everyone else did everything for her or things just kind of happened yes it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband however that was the only thing she ever really did for herself pick up the phone everything else was done for her mostly without her knowledge she was doing something that was so hard to do she should have felt like a strong woman to me but she didn t not in the least and i attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non actions of the main character one thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks while they were integral to the story they came at the oddest moments sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else if it was actually happening in real time or it was all in her head in the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation this left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real time conversation was even about overall the basics of the plot were interesting as were some of the characters in the book the book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse however it was not captivating i will not buy recommend or read this book again 
not soperfect life is far from perfect book i laughed out loud when i read annie lamont s operating instructions but i understood the source when i read it i am very disappointed in fox s book because she passes herself off as a suburban educated mom who is struggling with role definition the book is whiney to a fault and fox is not the typical educated professional with whom i can relate in the first pages i had difficulty getting past her foray into witchcraft and active participation in the pro abortion movement at least one of these if not both are huge mis connects for the average person much less the market for which the book was supposedly written skip this and read lamont 
there s a sucker born every minute this book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible what a bunch of baloney first of all evolution in the sense of common descent is not impossible even id iot superstars michael behe stephen meyer and jonathan wells have admitted as much see a summary of their recent testimony in the kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution creationism forum at the west virginia gazette wvgazettemail put forums after com so any id iot who thinks all that bafflegab about irreducible complexity ic and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply ignorant man evolved from non human ancestors get over it thaxton in particular ought to read that summary since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly id ioticin any case the empirical data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab talking about the allegedly empirical foundation for intelligent design makes it sound deliciously scientific especially to poorly educated id iots who generally are clueless about real science but even if the empirical data is accurate it s nothing but a facade because it has nothing to do with the book s main conclusion for example imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play beethoven concertos on the piano skeptical you ask for proof simple your neighbor replies see here s my dog and there s my piano only a moron would accept that as proof and yet id iot christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of proof from id iotic films like this the problem with your neighbor s proof is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano neither of those issues however was the real cause of your skepticism so the proof was entirely meaningless the critical issue of course was not the mere existence of the dog and the piano but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano and your neighbor s proof was completely silent on that issue again only a moron would accept evidence of mere existence as proof of piano playing ability in this book there s a lot of talk about how complex certain biological systems are that is nothing but meaningless bafflegab because the mere existence of complex systems is not a disputed issue the disputed issue is how those systems came into being and on that issue the book s evidence is completely silent this book was designed to fool poorly educated easily impressed id iots judging from the five star reviews it seems to have succeeded well there s a sucker born every minute and apparently a lot of them are found in evangelical churches and seminaries in one of the very first evolution debates thomas huxley accused bishop wilberforce of using his intellectual and oratorical gifts to mislead and bamboozle people things haven t changed much since then instead of meaningful evidence this book substitutes a god ofthegaps argument gee look how complex it is it must have been created by an intelligent designer maybe just maybe it was god wink wink godofthegaps arguments are dumb only ignorant suckers are taken in by them so if any of those folks who wrote five star reviews for this book would like to buy a nice bridge in brooklyn or a dog who can play beethoven concertos on the piano please give me a call i ll be happy to provide evidence ! 
a disappointment i have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time i couldn t force myself to get to the end continually i turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn t the way she moves the point of view from katharine back to the story is not enjoyable i would hate not to enjoy philippa gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
why do cultural ctitics have to write like this ok i know that nina auerbach is a famous groundbreaking feminist literary critic i don t disagree with many of her points in this book though i m innately suspicious of any system that fits as perfectly as hers does she never seems to find an example that doesn t fit her thesis rather like an undergraduate writing a paper and discarding any evidence that doesn t fit and i am interested in cultual criticism particularly the idea that horror fiction reflects the fears desires and fixations of particular time periods this said i found auerbach s book tough slogging why do cultural critics seem to feel that the lower the text they re criticizing the more jargon filled pedantic and convulted their prose style must become the endlessly long sentences with their multpile references and their twisting parenthetical asides made my eyes glaze over certainly auerbach is not the worst prose stylist of any academic i ve read but this fact itself is an indictment of the kind of writing that gets university professors published these days so yes there are insights and arguments in this book that make it worth reading but i found the experience of reading the book a rather depressing enterprise and it made me long for clearer livlier and more accessible writing from theorists and literary critics i can t say that i m optimistic on this count 
silly great cover enticing premise i couldn t wait to read this book but every one star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly let me add a couple more frannie grows up decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she s going to do what does her mother say that s nice dear i trust you to make the right decision oh please this is the th century after all ! then for good measure let s throw this one into the mix after the indomitable una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person famous or not that she comes into contact with she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole an oil well ! you must be kidding ! of course she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch i could go on and on i finished every page of this book although i must say i skimmed through the last pages when i finished and my husband asked how it was the only way i could think to describe it was silly 
if i could only give it a zero only pages into this book i ve had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is from the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the aap s neutral view on circumcision this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone thankfully i got this from the library all i have to do is return it and try and forget the bad bad information it provided keep looking 
keep your money this book was not enlighting alot of the information was out date the phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc 
beware difficult read perhaps this book explains schopenhauer with amazing clarity and detail but i couldn t make it past the first pages it s just one multi page paragraph after another the author needs to learn the concept of whitespace the introduction to essays and aphorisms provides a concise look at schopenhauer for the casual reader 
cameron s other titles are more useful to you as a writer julia cameron s books are the only companions that keep me from feeling stuck and isolated in a writer s life the artist s way and the sound of paper are fixtures on my bedside table because she s truthful sensible and uplifting and that s why i m disappointed in this book it falls very short of the mark true in its pages you will recognize all those people who hem you in or hold you up but you will perhaps also recognize what i did deep bitterness i m through the book and have been almost stunned at all the examples of asides about and ungloved swipes at movie industry people other blocking personalities are treated with a bit of remove and wry humor but when jc launches on the movie industryspecific examples her venom and bitterness seep through that flaw discredits whatever thin usefulness i might previously have found i hate to say this but i m glad i bought it used rather than new 
worst book i have read in a long time i have never read a danielle steel novel but my friend bought it when we were inter railing through europe last week so i picked it up out of sheer boredom the grammar is atrocious and the repetitiveness highly irritating how many times do sasha and what s his name need to break up and get back together how often does sasha need to cry about this artsy guy this book was so annoying that i had to literally put it down and stop reading it i will never pick up another danielle steel book and i am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published ! 
the giant should remain strong no matter what i read this book and it confirmed my feelings that usa as the only super power should always remain strong the book is composed of some pages full of critiques as if the author wanted america to be the haven of saints when the world has been full of crocodiles for instance the introduction brings about a fair resume of the author s intentionshow in the introduction i came across a passage which i hereby quote it was in the early days of the vietnam war that a vietcong officer said to his american prisoner you were our heroes after the war and a common phrase in those days was to be as rich and as wise as an american what happened the title killing hope updated edition by william blum and many of the contents are indeed offensive to the usa because it speaks about u s military and c ia interventions since world war ii and endeavours to portray them as the bad guys cia usa intervensions didnt such intervension save many countries that now live under the shades of democracies in europe and the far east japan enjoying unprecedented richness and prosperity with a high standard of living for their nationals as one individual out of six billion living on this planet do i blame the usa for protecting the interest of its citizens usa is the world giant and one has to learn how to convince them of one s view points rather than garrulously defy them with boring speeches and empty written words 
diary of a madman it s not too difficult to understand how behold a pale horse has become the best selling underground book of all time according to a blurb on one pro cooper website after all people want to and do believe in outlandish things the problem with the late bill cooper s book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy powerful men cooper believed this cooper was a nut therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut too rightly or wrongly this is what people believe if you re looking for a serious treatment of this subject albeit from the pov of someone who thought it was a good thing take a gander at carroll quigley s monumental tragedy and hope to all the if you can t handle the truth don t read this book reviewers who know little to nothing about bill cooper i invite you to do a google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth the real truth milton william cooper was a certifiable headcase numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard drinking ill tempered violent man who was incredibly easy to fool cooper s contention that john f kennedy was killed by william greer the driver of his limo in dallas is of course well knownbut he also believed and told audiences at his lectures that the aliens on the fox television show alien nation were real aliens he wasn t kidding cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information then take it and repeat it as gospel fellow fringe writers and researchers like bob lazar shunned cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him there was of course no need for anyone else to discredit him he took care of that himself nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book mostly documents and articles from other sources really with a comment here and there by cooper himself is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance anyhow ill go on record as saying that i believe the circumstances of cooper s death were suspicious i feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to pale horse this was a human being with real feelings but he was very very disturbed there are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally so many that behold a pale horse should never become any conspiracy theorist s bible 
predictable i read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen as soon as i met the character who would turn out to be the driver i knew the rest of the story it was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing the story s decent the text flows nicely and the suspension of disbelief is strong but where did nick s originality go where s the sweet and innocent charm of the notebook a walk to remember and nights in rodanthe it seems like he s run out of steam or didn t care too much about this one a decent book to read but don t expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work 
so unbelievable dull and annoying i will usually read and accept anything but this book is just so beyond fact for even realistic fiction i could have handled this book a lot better if there was no frankie the character frankie is just too unbelievable i work with talented and gifted children that are frankie s age years old and not one of them is even remotely this advvanced if frankie was say or i could accept her maturity her dedication to her music and so forth but this is not even believable to anyone who has a child or works with them it would be tolerable if frankie was not the center of the book they spend more time about frankie this and frakie that then on the main plot of the book this is the rd book that i have read or at least tried to read from iris johansen and it will be my last i just don t like the way she writes or her main characters evertime i buy another one of her books i am always hoping that this will be the one that changes my mind oh well another book to donate 
thinly disguised demagoguery by title this book claims to be a how to guide the first section however belies this by explaining that you should leave it to professionals having thus disposed of the technical aspects the author fills the remainder of the product with self righteous ultra greenie anti capitalist claptrap unsupported by fact or even verifiable cites not even well written propaganda and most certainly not useful to anyone wishing to learn anything useful about installing a pv system 
they shaved an ape and called him sean sean hannity s rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country especially when their audience consists of like minded organ banks hannity is stupid hypocritical and loud his sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon oxygen exchange hannity is well coiffed well dressed and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the hannity and combs report this bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt sizes too small get a real job you poser 
too much vernacular it might have been a good book but i got tired of reading the dis dat dem vernacular and finally just gave the book to the local thrift shop 
a waste of time read the first few chapters and the last few pages as usual the remaining pages were just repetition danielle steele should come up with a new formula as mentioned in previous reviews or tuck her pen away once and for all 
okay for some reason i don t believe this book the whole book seems like some kind of hoax a planned event there are several wonderful places a man going through a mid life crisis can explore on a motorcycle to find himself glen seems begging for all of these horrible things to happen to him the author is a bit full of himself and his uncultured descriptions of the places and faces he encounters are a complete bore i admit that when i purchased this book i was searching for the innocent escape i reaped by reading jupiters travels by ted simon not an ego charged made for t v action adventure 
a bit of a disappointment i have read all of the books in this series prior to reading sold out i enjoyed the series immensely and would have recommended the books to any teenager however after reading sold out my opinion has changed chloe s initial character was appealing because of her harder edge and atypical image unfornunately as i read the book i felt as though i was not reading the words of a teenager the slang was dated including words such as groovy and pretty tough chick as if these are typical of today s teenagers casual conversation throughout the story was far too structured to be that of teenage lunchtime banter making the story seem spurious also the issues in this book were either exaggerated or trivial few issues that chloe faced were relatable to teenagers today the book was trite dated melodramatic and mawkishly sentimental 
self delusion i ll cut to the chase self delusion is the title i chose for this review because anyone who read this and pretended it was a profound eye opening experience that revealed hard to grapple with truths about the contradictions in traditional theisms will need a ph d in self delusion albee disappointingly proves that he has quite an aptitude for self delusion if he believes as he seems to that this is a competent and wothwhile work i sincerely believe that my rating of two stars was kind and was a benevolent gesture towards a playwright i have much respect for everyone is self indulgent at times and so in a very christian manner note the irony uh oh is this indicator too cerebral and tedious guess it s because i just got through reading tiny alice i forgive the otherwise impeccable and inimitable edward albee 
i disliked anna i can actually understand morvan s character better given the th century backdrop of this novel however anna sounded more like a st century feminist to me she did not sound very genuine for a woman in that period i wish madeline had never written this book given that this is the only one of her novels if i remember the number correctly that i had to put down before reaching the end i just could not take the characters mainly anna however i loved to see david drop by rags 
minus stars this book is complete garbage there is nothing in it that is factual if you want to read tabloid material please go buy quotnational enquirer quot or something don t give your hard earned money or attention to this guy he never knew the harrison s and the book is fabricated stories by zealous bad author please go buy george s book quoti me mine quot or the beatles anthologyquot book is want to learn the truth about the man 
why continue to be deceived tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the pre trib circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler etc continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen s the real rapture based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period series see prophecy house s web site prophecyhouse dot com for details on these items 
this book is trash if you want a book about jarring hideous color combinations and no useful information whatsoever get this one there are so many bad art instruction books and this one is one of the worst most useless the cover of the book gives you an example of the horrible color schemes the author uses do you really want to make paintings like that also the color theory in this book is wrong quiller is one of those who still believes that the primary colors are red blue and yellow when they are actually cyan magenta and yellow i bought another book color theory made easy which is much better it teaches correct color theory and useful information i don t know what other good color theory books there are but i do know you shouldn t buy this useless piece of junk by quiller i am really tired of bad art instruction books getting rave reviews on amazon com and buying them because i was gullible enough to believe all these reviews 
probably your best option for now but having just returned from three weeks in china and taiwan i can report that the lonely planet guide to taiwan is generally helpful and reliable but it s hardly the ideal guide and often is entirely counter intuitive for instance there is a section on p consiting of five paragraphs on the topic of population and yet nowhere in that section do the authors tell us what the population of taiwan actually is for that bit of information we have to look at a sidebar on p entitled fast facts there seems to be a presumption that the traveller will read through the entire guide from front to back rather than use the book as a reference guide similarly the maps are less than ideal and the spare use of color plates does little to provide any real information color maps of taipei would have been far more useful given that the authors judge the national palace museum as a mustsee and they re right about that it would have been nice if they had mentioned that the museum will be undergoing major renovations from providing a website address for the museum also would ve been helpful unfortunately this seems to be the best option at present and one could do worse if you re going to taiwan i would encourage you to buy a copy but be warned it will not be one of the better guides you ve ever used 
first review i often read reviews of books that i am considering for purchase i read a brother s journey and found it to be a better read that kept my interest and that had some good writing with this book a teenager s journey i was somewhat disappointed since i depend so often on others reviews of books i am beginning to think that i need to take the time to review what i have purchased again i sympathize with both richard and david but this book did not make me feel strong emotions that made me want to turn page after page to see what would happen next 
the problem with lust in particular to the sexual topic author joshua harris who have scored no pun intended mind you a great hit with his first book on the subject of dating called i kissed dating goodbye spawned a sequel documenting his courtshipping days with his now found wife called boy meets girl this time harris had come up with a third installment on the subject of lust particularly on the aspect of human sexuality eventually the book just went on as being more of a stuff to only propagate organized churches ideals rather than to convey to its readers what its premise supposedly have guaranteed a book to help christians overcome their problems with sexual temptations presenting a certain idea of dependence to the common church communities norms chapters lone rangers are dead rangers although it did affirmed that the key to total deliverance from sinful problems is a sturdy connection with god chapter you can t save yourself which at the same time apparently only show the inconsistencies of what are the currently and commonly accepted prevailing concepts amidst the church circles of our day along with their popular explanation regarding god s salvation that runs like a confusing pretzel logic which only go around in tangled circles proclaiming that being salvation is only attainable by grace one has no real need to obey god and yet they would strain a gnat to follow into their church s system or otherwise condemnation is not too far around to be driveled out into the particular if one wouldn t submit into the dictates of their church s ideals thus unfortunately this book never delivered and in the long run harris stated it so in the book that he has no solution and there is no secret method at all in overcoming the lust problem harris book not even a hint live up to its title under the constriction of being a completely impotent material to help anyone who has a great problem with sexual temptations and not as to dismiss or belittle every person s own strengths and capacities regarding an individual s own area of weaknesses i find it crazy on the author s part to have strong sexual problems when it comes to seeing a copy of lingerie catalogues i mean being that he is a christian and married to his wife which would mean that he loves his wife synonymous to his devotion and commitment with his wife in that respect presumably and in being thus out of his respect for his wife sure enough although its automatic within a male s psyche to have that sexual suggestion in the mind whenever the sight of an insufficiently clad woman comes along he would ve not have a problem at all with that and be tempted to indulge in it or otherwise there is something wrong with his own perspective as a christian and for that matter about his love for his wife and how she really meant to him cause if one is really in love and needless to say devoted out of that condition to his wife he wouldn t have the knack to look lustfully at nor desire any other women at all but his very own wife believe you that ! thus at this point it only gives the idea that harris should ve taken more time in analyzing his own personal condition and learn more about the topic at hand before coming out with this book on the subject the aspect of a person s sexuality is the most private and personal thing that each person possessed as occultist and book writer donald michael kraig wrote on his book modern magick therefore sex is totally involved in our psyches control a person s sex life and you control the person kraig cites that the matter regarding sexuality is the very aspect wherein those who d like to manipulate and control its subjects within a group sect or cult is the very effective means to do so and is indeed used for brainwashing methods it s crazy that in most church communities these days they even control matters of courtship within their members not for the purpose of trying to peeve away many christians that perhaps this little review have done enough already for those who are so up with joshua harris as he s someone who s in the camp of their church s idealisms i think so called church of satan founder anton lavae presented a more better idea regarding the method to solve the problem of sexual urges although i bet that his motives could be moot as far as his sincerity goes under the context that he s on for the fa ade of trying to assert an appearance of some idyllic pretense against the christians and that it s not for the sake of plain earnestness in itself that one could have the means for sexual release or relief through indulging in sexual fantasies without committing to involve anyone upon it such as in example one would masturbate without fantasizing to involve any real person within those fantasies but are such that are consisting only of self created images kinda like in the movie cool world or of a fictionary person visualized for those sex fantasiestherefore under that context not only would the individual be free from the act of fornication but is also not guilty of committing any mental adultery towards another person deliverance from sexual struggles involves one s own personal acceptance understanding and knowledge about his or her own sexuality there are other books and resource materials that are much more helpful than this one by joshua harris that are available out there hence regarding the topic not even a hint scores not an inch of any helpful doze for its readers rather smooch unnecessary church demands goodbye 
prepared for what this extremely alarmist manual does not offer practical suggestions but a ritualistic rule of worry that will instill doomsday panic in anyone who tries to follow it shame on a practicing physician for coming up with such nonsense 
some of you guys are being ridiculous here sure this book is interesting but it is biased and out of date with modern day psychiatry yeah they used to as in past tense do electric shock therapy on patients with severe mental illness but that kind of thing is pretty unusual these days yes i agree that psychiatric medications is part of a multi million dollar business in our country but it still does help tons of people with chemical imbalances in their brain live a otherwise fairly normal life that they couldn t without treatment of their illness sure psych meds have side effects that can cause other health problems but once the medication is taken at low doses the side effects can be minimized or even eliminated usually the health problems is a temporarily result of the side effects and is treatable im sure some psychiatric care hospitals may have abused their patients in the past but it proably happens less now with all the mental health advocates out there prototecting the mentally ill also there are more patient rights now than what there used to be in past times we are not in the dark age anymore people paitents do have rights even the mentally ill ! i think some of you watch too many horror movies 
i m done with baldacci since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs here are my blurbs really hard to get into tough to follow who s who opens strong but fizzles out early i literally feel asleep while reading this book one night youll finally give up without really wondering who did it 
if you re over and trying to conceive do not buy this book my husband and i tried using this book and it s methods for almost a year with not even a hint at conception the author s frank opinion about trying to conceive after is negative and discouraging i refused to believe that i was infertile but because i am over it was very difficult to determine my fertile window using these methods it caused undo stress and anxiety and my husband and i finally broke down and spent the money to purchase an ovwatch we conceived the first time using the watch i am not trying to plug them for any reason other than it works we conceived twice using the watch after a year of frustration and depression they are the most decent supportive positive customer service oriented company i have ever encountered i found terri weshcler to be incredibly negative and judgemental of women trying to conceive at a later age and the last thing you need is another seed of negativity when you re trying to conceive 
this book is garbage i had to rate this book one star because there was no zero this book is complete garbage and the worst investment you can make to start your investment career there are other books on investing in this series which do an incredible job for beginners even the resource centers at any decent online broker has better information for you than this book has and the links won t go bad 
the marketing of evil the only thing i have to say is that it should have been listed as pure fiction 
sub standard i refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn t really write this i will try to describe him or her definitely a vegetarian possibly a member of peta dry writing style well crighton is dry even when he s excellent it bothers me how many unrealistic characters crichton uses it seems every character in some of these books earned a phd from mit by was an alternate on the olympic swim team a top researcher an accomplished pilot beautiful or handsome and wealthy these people do not exist in nature they also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete complex sentences quoting research in casual conversation but at least mc has a gift for crafting believable plausible sci fi much like isaac asimov but this is so beneath him i refuse to accept it 
a little dated i really don t understand what all the fuss is about this book i once took a class called quotmeat analysis quot when i was at southern houston community collge in the early seven though i was an art major it was a required course needed for graduation an educational reform dating from the connolly administration at the time i was living at the valmar appartments about miles from school and i used to have to take the freeway to get there this was way before they started building all the skyscrapers and houston seemed much more like a quotcow town quot than the city it is now there was this pool in the courtyard and most days there was a little get together in the backyard just some people from the building who would go to mixers and get to know other folks and neighbors it was mostly single people who lived there and although i had a girlfriend at the time sammy sue we went to high school together although we didn t know each other well enough to go to the prom together i would still attend on occasion there used to be cookouts this way i could hang out with my neighbors and maybe flirt a little and at the same time study for my mid terms in meat analysis ribs was the favorite dish one summer for some reason i remember that was the year that quotbilly don t be a hero quot came out and whenever that song came on the radio we d all get real quiet we didn t like to think about vietnam all that much we were more into socializing anyhow there was this guy that used to come by for our barbecues this guy george who just came from living in vermont or delaware or something i always get those small northern states with ivy league schools mixed up ! he used to like to drink a lot and boy did he ever love his barbecue i m not sure what he was doing there since he lived over in the really fancy apartment building the chateaux dijon and we were a little lower rent some people think this rich kid went there because the women at the valmar would be more easily impressed by his money it was so weird he would swagger in and within an hour he d get so blotto that he d slump into a lawn chair and start mumbling something about oil or terepin turtles or something it changed from minute to minute 
torture is good for the commonweal noted civil libertarian alan dershowitz joins forces with noted civil libertarian dick cheney in why terrorism works and calls for the judicious use of torture when dealing with our enemies according to the dershowitz cheyney school of interrogation if a foe s testicles are crushed in a vice a sterile vice then he will tell all what he will tell is whatever the testicle mashers want to hear so that they will stop mashing his testicles the good professor has evidently forgotten the hoary old legal chestnut about one drop of ink polluting the whole bottle of milk usually cited by the trial lawyer asking for a mistrial because a witness has blurted out inadmissable evidence in front of a jury torture is wrong morally and constitutionally a wee bit of it applied to really bad people is still wrong 
who cares why do we need another history book about ignorant cowards hiding behind bed sheets perhaps include details on the bed sheets thread count 
there is academic work on this topic this is not it devon is right emotions are human adaptations but this is not a new discovery he came up with cosmides and tooby founded an entire new field called evolutionary psychology based on the idea that psychological adaptations are formed the way physical adaptations are they ve written many scholarly articles and many books are available on the topic many popular books on this subject contain silly errors or a bit of the author s ego but this one it out there way out there here s the thing this is a scientific field but devon is utterly unpracticed in it his conclusions are logically based on his premises but his premises are utterly unfounded just because his overarching premise is true emotions are adaptations doesn t mean all his little pet ideas have any basis in reality at all what is the proof for example that human beings start over with a new partner for each child in fact there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary most men do not want to couple with a woman with children from another man the idea that at months a child no longer needs resources from two parents is simply laughable to suggest they need no parents at all and the mother can simply go on with a new man and produce a new child is in the realm of the absurd 
what a disappointment let me start by saying i had no less than books i consulted on a regular basis during my pregnancy and my favorite was the week to week guide this book was a huge disappointment not only do the weeks not always correspond to the age of the child weeks vs months but i found that a lot of the milestones were a little ambitious as well the book also comes across as very judgemental baby swings are known as neglect omatics cosutmes can scare a baby so keep him home on halloween and gives you things to worry about without telling you why to soothe a baby you can swing them but don t bounce i think the book should offer advice and then it s up to me to figure out what to do at first i thought it was just me being post partum and sensitive but my baby is weeks old now and i can see the book is just not helpful buy what to expect the first year it gives enough information without making you worry about every little thing and gives you enough information to make an informed desicion without telling you what to do 
need lots of materials to make cards i think that the book had lots of cute ideas but they all require lots of separate materials that i did not already have in my vast collection of cardmaking and scrapbooking supplies you could use the basic ideas and modify them to make your own cards though 
wasted space i was very disappointed with the content and layout of this book the amount of wasted pages for workspace is excessive but considering the lack of true content i assume they needed to fill pages with something 
i hate this book this is the worst textbook i have ever bought for any class ! it is a huge waste of money and super frustrating to read this book is horribly written the explanations are boring drawn out and unclear the early chapters draaaag on forever the later chapters get a little better but they state a lot of obvious or useless information i have spent hours and weeks studying from this text and learned very little 
don t buy don t buy this book the book simply teaches you some basic thoery 
not very good i know batali has become an american icon for italian cooking but this book is poorly written and assembled it is boring to thumb through with recipies that invite you to close the book and go to another i love italy and both northern and southern cuisine but this just doesn t work for me 
hannity and this book are an example of nonthinking american lives hannity receives his talking points every day from the rnc and then repeats them like the summoner from canterbury tales repeating his two or three latin phrases hannity s phrases liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm s way liberals don t want to defend america and fought homeland security every step of the way when it was bush who fought it howard dean hates republicans he is unhinged so is hillary al gore john kerry and every republican except for ben nelson and joe lieberman osama bin laden was offered up to clinton on a silver platter never happened so as al franken says hannity knows facts all of which are outright lies or misrepresentations so please don t try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the facts he knows dont waste your money on this book it and he are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other he is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut begotten on his listeners backs 
i m outraged first of all shame on the women who gave this book glowing reviews on the first few pages ! i was completely shocked had to re read the passages several times by the authors suggestion that a woman who was sexually approached by a co worker basicallly overreacted by becoming angry and that she should have instead interpreted the pass as his awkward attempt to find some way to connect with her might she have deflected the pass but turned the attempt into something more suitable to a collegial work relationship page give me a break ! i can t believe that this example of gaining influence over people ever made it past the editor and if that wasn t bad enough they again insulted women on page when they explain that a women ponders her failure in a management role by saying i still haven t figured out why they allowed a female especially one without an engineering background to manage the project what i had to check the front of the book to see if it was published in the s ! besides these profoundly ignorant examples i found the book to be less than marginal in developing my ability to influence those around me i ll look elsewhere 
i like the red one more i like the original red structural package designs by haresh pathak 
the most boaring book alive the book is called the circuit this book is about a boy named francisco jimenez who wants to be another person he had a hard time in school because he almost knew no english he couldn t understand her he had brothers and sister and a mom and dad the worst thing to him was getting deported in school he had a problem with kids named curtis and his friend they were the bullies once francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to curtis of course he didn t know he was lucky they didn t beat him up later they became friends his brother that was born after him had a rare disease but he made it through i think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives after every chapter he wanted you to put the book down he didn t leave any suspense i hated the book so much 
not for beginners i got a used copy of david weller s book beginning net game programming in c from amazon first of all using the word beginning in the title of this book is deceptive it s not a book for beginners in any way the author not only assumes you are an experienced windows programmer but that you already know how to work with graphics and are more than familiar with creating event handlers using onpaint etc in the first chapter in the classic microsoft style of documentation he begins by bragging about all the wonderful graphics things you can do with c like gradients alpha blending cardinal splines transformation etc but doesn t have the courtesy to supply a single code example to show you how to do any of these wonderful things in fact if you leaf through the book page by page you will find that there is not a single complete code example in the entire book what the author refers to as snippets are nothing more than poor incomplete code examples as we reach the first code example the author says the following code shows how to draw a simple red rectangle no it doesn t all it is is a lonely onpaint method the author doesn t bother to explain how to make it work but proceeds to tack on one of those little note fields saying that you need to create an event handler the example supplied however is an event handler for something else entirely ! the next example shows you how to create graphics objects from an image but doesn t bother to explain how to import the image ! you are expected to magically how to do that i guess it is clear that the author david weller doesn t even understand the topic material what he did was go to somebody that does understand how to program and got a half dozen cheezy programs which he devoted a chapter each to with a feeble attempt to tack a bunch of comments inbetween if you want to make a tetris clone and not much else there s a very slim chance you might get something out of this book although you will have to type up pages of code yourself before finding out whether it will even run or not because there is no cd included with the book the author assumes you know so much about programming already that quite frankly if you knew that much you wouldn t need his lame book the author is neither a programmer nor a writer i wouldn t recommend this book to anyone it gives me a big knot in my stomach thinking how many other sincere beginners will end up wasting perfectly good hard earned cash on this complete waste of trees dillinge 
chanukah is not the jewish christmas with such wonderful illustrations and a mostly enjoyable text it s too bad that this book gets its inspiration from twas the night before christmas jewish parents work hard teaching their children that chanukah is not the jewish christmas this book doesn t help there are much better choices out there 
interesting plot but bad details this book could have been so much better since the plot is really good the writing here is a knockoff of michael crighton and really doesnt juve very well i found myself skimming the pages after a while the subject of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
living in a bubble i read this book with absolutely no knowledge of barna his revolution or any biases in relation to it i would like to make the comment that this book is seriously flawed in the superficial and short sightedness that it demonstrates thankfully the author does not claim to have pulled any of his data that he uses to support his theory from anywhere other than the american churches however he then uses it to apply to the church which is global in nature and that is the book s serious flaw it is short sighted in that he does not seem to apply anything about the global church and local churches to his theories other than what is happening according to his observations in the us while there may be some value to these insights i resent that he is equating what he observes in american churches as what is happening and will happen in the global church id like to see him ask the question why while american churches in his opinion are failing are so many churches globally flowering and prospering what makes him think that american churches which make up a minority of all churches worldwide should be the sole trendsetter from the perspective of what is presented in this book it seems the author is living in a bubble and is making a superficial and overly generalized prediction for the church sure this book is easy to read and understand sadly i believe it is actually the poorer for these qualities if it weren t i could at least try to believe that his writing is not as superficial as it is 
suzanne somers is giving middle aged women false hope suzanne somers is partial scam artist she claims that if you follow the advice in her books prepare her recipes use her skin products etc you can look as good as she does for her age she never mentions all the cosmetic surgery and lipo suction she has had done i know a number of plastic surgeons and dermatologists and they all claim that there is no way that her face and body can look as good as it does for her age without cosmetic surgery on her face and body and touch ups along the way however her books with their beautiful pictures of her and her recipes are lovely to look at but she is giving women who are in their s and beyond false hope she should really write a book about all the work she has had done what it was like the cost which the average woman cannot afford etc 
just enough truth to deceive avoid this poison pill yes childhood sexual abuse is a real problem and those who were victimized in that way need to have the suport to move beyond it however courage to heal and its companion allies in healing set about providing that support in entirely the wrong way if you compare thier suggested approaches to recovery and overcoming the symptoms to the professional psychiatric organizations there are repeatedly in contradiction to one another i used to recommend these books and own them both and the workbook too but after seeing their practices carried out and how they work to actually isolate the potential victim from existing suport networks if hte recovered memories are disputed by uninvolved family members i can t come up with a strong enough warning over the course of my marriage of seven years my wife has steadily declined in function as her therapist has continuously encouraged her to try to recover her memories of childhood abuse and has worked to incresingly isolate her from family and friends concerned about her steady decline and the contradictions present in her memories over and over again she has pointed to expert sources like courage to heal to dismiss efforts to get her into a form of therapy that is not focused on trying to interpret bad dreams and imagining abuse to convince oneself that sexual abuse really occurred it is a myth that someone with emotional troubles has to recovery the memories of why they have difficulty or that things have to get worse before they get better the long term psychotherapy and memory recovery methods recommended by the author are actually considered to be harmful when a patient is having a bout of severe depression the real experts eg the apa stress that the focus sould be on short term therapeutic methods proven to yeild results in handling one s current life situation and only pursiing long term therapy and working through firm memories when the patient has fully stabilized and then only if the memories present an ongoing hindrance to a full recovery if you can become fully functional without recovering any potentially buried memories there is no reason to seek them out avoid avoid avoid if someone has already recommended these books to you research for yourself the professional recommended treatment approaches for the symptoms presented eg depression ocd etc and how to evaluate if one s therapy is good or bad 
known as america s poet whitman is not poetic walt whitman s life s work is his leaves of grass enlarged over the years with additional poems regarded as america s poet whitman wrote in the s through the s encompassing both the manifest destiny ideology of the pre war through the reconstruction period of us history the poems are diverse and upbeat the language for the most part is clear and easy nevertheless like most poetry today the poems are so little different from prose except in the presentation into lines very few poetic devises are used one may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry but in comparison to rhyhming verse by longfellow frost byron browning or shakespeare current poetry appears meaningless although a classic leaves of grass offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology none of his poems are memorable not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature i give two stars to the work simply because i must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie dead poet s society so the reputation of the work must be quite impressive though it beats me how that is 
negative stars contains every trendy lefty misconception there ever was about the war totally and hopelessly untrue 
bald self promotion i read the first two chapters scanned the rest and decided not to waste any more time there are too many good books to read the premise of the writer de becker is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails he tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot the lady whose boy died during an operation and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert in every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy s safety before a bad thing happened to de becker each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong the author does not cite his sources but makes it clear that he is the world s foremost consultant and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and tv appearances on oprah the book might be better if it was all stories but it is padded out to pages with a lot of hot air it never happens that anyone is taken by surprise or has an unfounded suspicion becker gives us a slanted unbalanced view in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat the evidence is cooked the thesis must be rejected i offer the alternate hypothesis that de becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents 
ok butnot really impressed hi maybe its me but i was not as happy with this as i thought that i d be i will keep trying to listen to the cd read the book thoughjust in case i haven t given it as fair of a reviewas i should have l 
written too soon i got this book on remainder very cheap it was not worth what i paid for it tho this was quickly written or ghost written by larry garrison and his sister stephanie good it is poorly written and hard to follow there are no specifics and much speculation things seem to be thrown into the mix simply for sensationalismthere are some passages that seem to show real emotion from dave and this is sad however the book was totally premature written much too quickly even since it s publication various new events and things occurred and it was out of date the day it came out since there has been no real resolution to this case why did he write it so soon it seems to be thrown together the shango stuff is pretty silly too since those poems and stuff were on the web for months and were pretty much discredited that was a prank not some real cult lolsad book altogether and not worth the time 
not for complete idiots i have a ph d in philosophy but could not follow the descriptions in this book of how to use a compass and topo maps in conjunction with a gps i also was as confused after i finished reading the book as before i started about such questions as how to find something in a forest when the satellite connection doesn t work on the other hand the book does give a decent introduction to the sport and general procedures of geocaching 
boring bought because it s purportedly a must read of recommended english th century literature and i m trying to read every good book i can before i die hopefully at unfortunately this book is a waste of time as it s boring even w the footnotes that i so dearly love 
i know it s a classic but i know this play is suppose to be a classic and a master of it s genre but if this is the best this genre can produce this genre must be worse than plan from outer space the play is trite and cliched it s whole meaning is that everything is meaningless is it just me or is that a bit ironic unless you have to read this play for school don t read it if i had gone to see this play in a theatre i would have walked out after minuntes why can t people write good and decent plays like shakespeare or sophoclese i know i spelled them wrong sorry this new genre of pointless dialogue is well pointless i wonder if all of these playwrites are writing these plays and laughing at the fools that think they are good beckett is probably laughing in his grave because he is still fooling people if you like non sense and you like to look like you are philisophical go ahead and read it but don t say you weren t warned 
zen reflections not tea parties i purchased this book while planning a tea party the statement seasonal tea parties on the front of the book is misrepresentative of the actual contents this book is focused more on the art of tea drinking and relaxation techniques and suggestions than directions on how to conduct a tea party the back cover of the book is more properly representative when it states youll find the perfect way to enjoy the moment it is a zen tea focus not serve people tea and crumpets for your mother s birthday focus 
porn movie reading this book is like watching a porn movie all sex and no plotline another thing i found unbelievable is that helen took back her maiden name and became a miss again from what i know of the period women loved to be a widow because that status granted them more freedom coulter could not come up with a good explanation why helen would take back her maiden name after her first husband died 
don t read if this is your first scifi book it was my first and it was quite disjointed i didn t finish it not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic too weird for me 
a long depressing journey when our book club selected this novel i was enthusiastic the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story however after the first chapter or so i kept waiting for the big wow factor and it never came i found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well developed like other readers i finished it out of obligation but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it 
worst book of recently i got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years unfortunately i had to recall confidenceeasily the worst book i ve read in years to describe it as disappointing is to go easy on ms kanter it is far beyond that and altogether abominable and embarrassing that such a prestigious business school like harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind lets start with the central and only idea of the book that winning begets winning and losing begets losing this of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book s worth of elaboration yet ms kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details why this is the case as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn t figure it out in a couple of minutes how it affects team morale how it self perpetuates etc and worst of all endless endless endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate rather they simply restate what has just been said and they restate and restate and restate tautological i think the word was invented in anticipation of this book boring tedious insipid stupid unthoughtful unenergetic disengaged disrespectful all these adjectives apply forcefully to the book most of all though it is utterly uninventive and cliched turn to any page and you ll find such gems of penetrating insight as forgive me but these are so funny i have to quote at length winning feels good and good moods are contagious success makes it easier to view events in a positive light to generate optimism it produces energy and promotes morale it is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target p overcoming obstacles leaping over hurdles and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure p once the loser label gets slapped on those suffering losses are set up to fail they find it harder to get support harder to get opportunities p various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people execution is play by play game by game while strategy is season by season p people embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good it takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it restoring people s sic confidence in one another requires four kinds of action p confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome but what happens when outcomes are negative the dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks that decision to build rather than retreat to rally rather than get discouraged involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens as an opportunity to learn and move on p and it just goes on and on mercilessly and cluelessly the wisest most incisive business people read study and think about far more than just sports and business i would recommend ms kanter first enroll in a decent freshman level literature or history seminar there she can learn to write and with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem solvingbeyond this bilge i have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence these are selected essays by montaigne and emerson hamlet whitman s song of myself david herbert donald s biography lincoln emotional intelligence flow and jack welch s winningconfidence inspires confidence only in the realization that you no matter who you are are at least intelligent enough to be the ernest l arbuckle professor at harvard business school 
overrated this is by far the most known novel bryce has written and there isn t much to comment unfortunately it s a classic in peru as far as i read but as chinua achebe s things fall apart this is one of those folklore books that won t appeal to my fiction reading hunger it seems shallow most of the times the character pov of the kid julius never works out what s going on around him no true sequels julius parents are made of one piece of cardboard the setting is the only thing that might be of interest very much like achebe s novel and julius barely grows by the end of the novel at page for that matter go check coetzee s waiting for the barbarians or peruvian vargas llosa s the war of the end of the world two contemporary masterpieces 
i hated it i just didn t like this book i wanted to put it down and not pick it up ever again but once i start reading a book i have to finsh it first she was trying to run away from her past then i dont know why her husband stayed with her she made me sick and i liked her sister more than her i was kind of hoping that her husband would have left her for her sister instead of staying with her eric jerome dickey has been slipping in his last few books i hope the next two coming out this year will be better ashley 
still shopping i could have written this book in six words quotbecause it makes you feel good quot 
not serious poorly edited error filled but amusing if you are deeply concerned with what various second or third rate actors and television personalities of to years ago did during the wwii this is the book for you otherwise this is a throw away the most startling new information provided in this book are that prescott bush was a senator from maine and that winston churchill was prime minister of the united kingdom during the german invasion of poland of course prescott bush was a senator from connecticut and churchill became prime minister in the spring of after the anglo french invasion of norway was defeated by the simultaneous german invasion france and england did not really come to the rescue of norway from a german invasion they had planned their own invasion of norway at the same time as the german invasion they were delayed by several hours due to weather and claimed to be helping norway against germany paradoxically chamberlain fell because of the fiasco in norway and churchill who was the architect of this disaster became prime minister ! of course this is the kind of fact you are never told about the war that someone like wright could never tell you i expected to find such things in this book mike wright s ignorance and the absence of any apparent fact checking by the publisher indicate that both are worthless as sources of serious information with no special knowledge or interest in world war ii wright compiles a bunch of humorous or trivia related vignettes about the war as he appears to do about as many subjects as he can publish books howeveri feel sorry for someone like the author who believes people need to know how swooze kurtz whatever she does got her name i feel sorrier for someone who is bamboozled into thinking this is a book with new information about the greatest tragedy in human history a war in which scores of millions of people died and many countries laid waste deserves more than drivel like that with the opening of the archives of the old ussr and the gdr all sorts of information that was not known before is available for a serious author who really wants to tell us things that we weren t told about wwii i expected this kind of information when i purchased this book yet wright is oblivious to the fact the major segment of wwii in europe was fought between the ussr and germany and its allies his goal is to provide quick entertaining light reading on a subject that is neither quick entertaining nor light the copy editing and fact checking in this book is simply not professional while a bibliography which is useful is provided there is absolutely no regular sourcing in this book which may in fact be a tribute to adequacy of his sources compared to the inadequacy of his history as somone who teaches college students to discern which books to use for research papers and which to avoid i would advise people to avoid any book brought out by this publisher for serious research or reliable knowledge this book does have its moments he gives an interesting blow by blow picture of the draft process when it was launched in he also provides interesting information about the deportation of japanese americans and canadians and about german prisoners of war in the us however though he condemns japanese brutality to allied prisoners wright is completely silent the attrocities the us and uk perpetrated against japanese soldiers who wished to surrender allied policy was usally not to take japanese prisoners but to massacre them a grisly trade in japanese sculls and gold teeth sent back to the usa grew up during the war this is the kind of fact about world war ii that they didn t teach you that is light years away from anything mike wright knows for a better look check out why the allies won for an even better set of information about the pacific war that is never told consult war without mercy by john w dower which will tell you about allied abuse of japanese prisoners as well as japanese crimes against other asian peoples i found this book ok to read while i was sick in bed i did not want anything demanding although i must say that one driving factor in getting me to finish it was to see how many ignorances and errors the book contained like the one harliquin romance i read under similar circumstances i thought it was appropriate to throw the book away when i finished it it is unfortunate amazon does not permit one to have stars or negative quantites of stars 
trish i gave this book one star because there are no negative numbers available the other reviews here are all true ! this is a horrible textbook that jumps from subject to subject quickly gives simplistic examples in the chapter and then throws complex homework problems with new components not explained in the chapter oh and don t let me forget to mention that the terminology changes from chapter to homework as well ! a friend with two masters business and engineering became so frustrated trying to help with a problem that he threw his hands up the terminology kept throwing him off if you are supposed to buy this text i suggest you either show these to college administration ahead of time or take another class this is so bad i won t even sell mine back i m throwing it in my grill to burn 
a not sopractical guide to new urbanism the suburban landscape of the united states is the subject of this book advertised as the first practical guide to creating communities that truly are communities not merely enclaves near off ramps guided by the principles of the congress for the new urbanism cnu the book uses excerpts from that organization s charter to illuminate its advocacy of more connected development patterns the book s scope extends beyond the commercial strip to include the major building blocks of towns and suburbs such as apartment complexes schools parks and office campuses hall and porterfield includes passages of fist thumping suburbia bashing similar to james howard kunstler s home from nowhere touchstone books or jane holtz kay s asphalt nation crown they also include graphic material much of it adapted their earlier book a concise guide to community planning mcgraw hillreaders knowledgeable about new urbanism will find few surprises here other than a few glaring factual errors like a reference to tysons corners virginia one of the largest metropolitan areas in the united states p and a claim that edge cities and urban villages are two names for essentially the same thing p good points crop up here and there but recommendations are so limited in scope that it can be difficult to discern whether the sample site designs are intended to be good or bad examples which limits the book s usefulness pedagogically the lack of dimensions on most of the drawings also severely limits the book s utility as a practical reference hall and porterfield contrast conventional suburban development and traditional neighborhood development options for site plans but the comparisons sometimes seem forced and nearly always ignore the larger regional issues so critical to the debate one ideal audience for this book might suburban planning commissioners who need guidance from designers in order to understand the differences between conventional suburban development pods and walkable human scaled neighborhoods 
a treatise in chamberlainian liberalism barber is a quintessential liberal thinker who believes in unabridged ability of human beings to do good thinks like improving living conditions and spreading good governance hence his vision on how to spread good things in the world by reasoning education being nice sacrificing sovereignity for the sake of international institutions and acting on international arena in the way that is devoid of selfish motives in the end of the day this idealistic vision brings barber to lamenting the downfall of the taliban if anything it proves that road to hell is paved with good intentions that is why that is a perfect agenda for acting with humans societies and governments that share your basic values and visions this is not a preventive but rather supportive democracy it definitely has a legitimate role in international politics but only this far let us admit that not everyone is nice and can be changed by proper education some of the worst dictators like fidel were educated in the west some of the worst terrorists like or london bombers received everything from the western society in terms of education affluence and opportunities this brings to the question whether liberal wilsonian thinking is a proper compass to navigate yourself beyond the world of shared values dictators fanatics and terrorist actually understand the power of good ideas that is why they block their spread you can educate and be nice to the people only where you are allowed to preemptive dictators easily block preemptive democracy by sensoring books closing borders disrupting broadcasts here is why wilsonian idealism stops it simply does not know how to deal with the people who only perfect themselves in being evil oh mr barber did you travel to kabul in why did not you go and talk and convince mulla omar about the virtue of good education yeah it is easy to talk multilateralism in new york and berlin but it is only because that is where it works unlike what barber says terrorism is for real and it is nourished by the dictatorial states the threat of nuclear proliferation is for real and north korean testings only confirm this here barber goes into what every ideologue no matter left or right falls when reality does not coincide with vision that is denial denial that evil in the world is not constrained to george w bush and neocons this denial makes him fail to recognize the fact that dictators and terrorists free ride on multilateralism that is they use international institutions rules treaties etc to obstruct democratic powers to bind their hands and to go on with repressions genocide nourishing terrorism etc if you need examples how multilateralism kills look at bosnia and darfur preemptive democracy beyond the area of shared values is hence nothing but cover up for this free riding one thing i totally agree with barber is much what he says about the iraq war it was a wrong decision to go into it but let us face it the character of war changed dramatically since it is no longer the war on saddam s state it is the war on stateless terrorism on the people ready to slaughter their ethnic and religious kin on the people ready to kill italians russians jordanians shia whatever stays in their front withdrawal from this war is capitulation equal to munich oh yeah peace for our time like chamberlain said by no means war shall be a primary weapon in spreading democracy but it shall be an option in exceptional cases let us admit not humans are perfectible let us acknowledge that some have to be constrained and deterred let us agree that rules of contstraining deterring and if necessary destroying evil shall not be entrusted with the bodies where libya chairs the human rights commission if we want for multilateralism let us organize the community of democracies let us recognize that luxembourg shall have more voice on the international arena than china only because it does not slaughter and persecute its people if this is the case i will have no problem to give luxembourg and the us equal voice preventive democracy shall be the first choice of the tool because it is safe and because it is nice but insisting that this is the only available tool means denial of the obvious if the world could have been changed by the nice means only it could have been a nice world unfortunately this is not the case insisting on the opposite means disarming oneselves from osamas kim jong ils and akhmadinejads and that is why barber mourns the downfall of the taliban 
i wanted to like it i wanted to like this book i really did i thought it had many good ideas for inspiring writing and getting the creative process flowing however i found none of them novel i am not only a voracious reader but also avid attender of writing classes and workshops i earmarked this book at the top of my list because i thought that the reviews were great and the title was clever i was immediately inspired and excited to get into the book once i started the book i realized that i would have preferred to read a bit more before i stopped to workshop for me the exercises became tedious and it was difficult to continue my flow from book to paper i suppose for the beginning writer who has never taken a workshop this book may be a great introduction and very helpful if you have taken many workshops you may find the process cumbersome if not remedial i was too frustrated to finish the book and am taking another writing workshop class instead 
not very enjoyable as a big fan of the or so l m montgomery books i ve read and re read i was so excited to finally find a copy of this book but when i started reading it i was really disappointed i know this book was published posthumously and wondered if maybe she hadn t had time to polish the stories in it basically i found it boring one or two stories i couldn t even bother to finish and others i ve never re read none of the stories were wholly satisfying each lacked something of the charm and entertainment of her previous short stories those that started well ended flat another reviewer mentioned that they didn t find l m montgomery s previous short stories satisfying but i enjoyed the style of those earlier ones which is perhaps why i didn t like these they really have a different flavour to her other stories although she still includes a number of her common themes 
written too much towards evangelicals although scott s story is interesting i had a hard time relating to it even as a protestant who is going through the process of converting to catholicism he assumes the reader has a thorough background in protestant theology and will be familiar with the ins and outs of delicate biblical arguments each chapter is split with of the chapter being scott s story and the last being kimberly s version this can get confusing when trying to remember who is talking personally not recommended 
hardly about robert oppenhimer the title of this book is very misleading it is minimally about los alamos and even more minimally about robert oppenheimer you will learn more about the travails associated with the drive from santa fe to los alamos than you will about any of the scientific contributions of robert oppenheimer the author seemed to take more interest in the social activities in los alamos than in what oppenheimer was offering to contribute to the production of the atomic bomb except of course that is for his famous martini s and his inspiring speeches there was entire chapter devoted to the birth rate at los alamos this is not what i hoped to learn regarding los alamos and oppenheimer then there was the authors droning on about the socio political tensions amongt the scientists wives the woman dorothy mckibbin who was responsible as the gatekeeper at east palace place was frequently portrayed as having and endless infatuation of oppenheimer all the way through the book references were made regarding how enthralled she was of him even on page he hypnotized me with those blue eyes again i fail to see what that has to do with oppenheimer as the father of the atomic bomb or the secret city of los alamos if you pick this book hoping that it will promise what the title suggests you will be very disappointed 
disappointed reader this is the worst how to book i have ever read the author never makes a definitive statement about anything instead he says you could do this or that hire someone or do it yourself blah blah blah he rambles on about the same subjects repetitively to fill up the pages i feel like i have not learned anything of any use after reading the entire book what a major disappointment 
wrong item sent i received a book that i didn t even order the one i ordered is yellow and white th edition this isn t the one i ordered therefore i need a refund i sent the book back and i know the seller received it on 
more bridget jones than debra messing the book was okay but i really loved the movie there are major differences in the book that completely change the tone first of all she s british and more closely resembles bridget jones than her movie counterpart you see a lot more of her friends in the novel also she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight she is not described to look anything like debra messing but rather an overweight squishy girl which is completely fine but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes the writer is british i believe so it has more of the british slang which at first is a little confusing it s not thackeray mind you but don t expect any american tones their relationship is more drawn out which is fun to read still what i remember most was how we envision all the characters domonic included as a little chunky they aren t size models we get it ! now get over it 
not good i thought the title was interesting so i bought this book wow what a disappointment this is sappy and poorly written how does mitch albom keep getting on the best sellers list 
i don t like it i don t like the book becuase the mom diyd in the begining of the story the story is about a litol girl in the begining of the story and after the begining it s about a litol gril named cendrillon and a prins and a faerygodmother in the mittol of the story and she wont s the prins look at her like a rich person at ferst then she wont s the prins look at her like her sell 
you do plan to have chain masters on your chain master tour you gotta love a book called master of chains which deprives you of anything even remotely resembling a master of chains until the last pages of text oh wait no you don t lebow destroys the nice tapestries he managed to weave with decent dramatic prose by tripping through the worst action writing i ve ever seen as with most of the d d novels the editor assigned to this book is completely incompetent and has no business working in professional publishing 
lacks depth this book really only covers a general concept of the computer animation field for people wanting to just unearth the mere basics and lingo the glossary at the end of each chapter might be useful besides that the book lacks any real depth to the topics discussed and is rather disappointing when these terms are freely available online the getting ready tips for each section was laughable written with the assumption that readers lack common sense furthermore the unorganized structure of the book meant the referenced picture in the text is in most cases a few pages away my star goes to the coloured pictures and the glossary 
likable read no direct skills i thought this book would offer more in the way to make changes in your home instead it is a nice narrative of people who have been helped by the author i prefer a direct how to approach and this was not it very disappointing gregory bodenhammer has two books on this topic that are more direct concise and to the point i found that back in control and parent in control had a lot of useable information 
painfully boring last week i happened to come across this book in the library as i had recently bought writing a book that makes a difference and writing creative nonfiction instruction and insights from teachers of the associated writing programs by the same author i thought it would be good to read this book to get a feel of what s in store when i finally get down to reading my own books gosh i hope the other two books are better than this one i tried hard to read this book but i had to give up finally call me a philistine but i just could not get into it im at a loss with words to describe how this book simply could not grip my attention 
a sight better left unseen this book chronicles a few years in the childhood of a young girl named hattie whose mother is a severe manic depressive unlike other children hattie and her brother freddy operate more as caretakers than as children they watch their mother and act according to her state of mind for that specific day pearl the cook and maid acts as surrogate mother nurturing the siblings with care and love as they grow older something their mother has never been able to do pearl also acts as guardian to the mother keeping her from leaving the house in a frenzy when she is manic and from killing herself when she is depressed although this book was easily read in a day it was disappointingly bland and somewhat anti climactic i can t place exactly what it was it just didn t build up to a page turning quotwhatwillpossiblyhappennextquot mindset and i grew bored and apathetic towards the end which is highly unusual for me i would recommend it as a good thought provoking informative book on manic depression but certainly not as entertaining fiction 
interesting theme but no bridge is built william dembski is one of the great names in the intelligent design movement he holds a ph d in mathematics and philosophy and have earned grades in theology an psychology when such a man writes a book and call it intelligent design the bridge between science theology i had great expectations that he had succeeded in making this important bridge i think you can read this book in at least two ways one as an introduction to how the leading people behind this movement think and for such a presentation i give the book stars dembski is very good at using interesting parables to illustrate his arguments but as a bridge between science and theology it is totally failing and that is sad because the probability for intelligent design is in fact high as dembski shows us but dembski mess it up through most of his book as science i give this book star and end up with a compromise at stars dembski uses much space to general logic as to show that if you have two similar books containing the same shakespeare play these two books doesn t have any more information together than one of the books alone ok and so what after pages with such stuff you begin to be impatience and wonder how and when will all this logical stuff be used to prove intelligent design and then as you have waited and waited dembski finally writes that it is not space in this chapter and not in other chapters either to explain the big bang by his intelligent design theories what a disappointment couldn t he instead have skipped some of the logic but after a while you understand that dembski actually lacks any intentions to reveal the most basic things that normally should have concerned intelligent design he claims that intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature in nature and that these signatures are observable why can t he tell us what this observable signatures are he writes that god s fingerprints in nature are imperically detectible but how why wont he tell us dembski writes that something is made by intelligence when it can show both complexity and specification ink spelt on a paper can show some complexity in pattern but it is not specified before the ink spells letters and words with meaning he then uses this criteria for intelligent design in nature and call it science and a proof of intelligent design when nature is both complex and specified but can you prove god this way i think you only can believe in intelligent design and that a strong probability for god never fully can prove him anyway dembski does not try to prove god either he just confirm that god exists because he have seen him in nature as the result of intelligent design no one can criticise you for believing in an intelligent designer but if you want to make this belief into science it is not enough just to call it science as dembski does you have to fullfill certain criteria and rules to call something science dembski dosen t follow these rules at all dembski spend much of his time in this book to criticise others for not being scientific often just because they don t accept intelligent design as science he says that naturalism is metaphysic and not science based on evidence if he had used his own definitions he uses on others the intelligent design he presents wouldn t either be scientific he neither seems to remember what he wrote some pages earlier after proving that christ was the logo by which the world was created he later writes that intelligent design not necessarily must have originated from any specifically god at all are you confused like me an interesting objection to the kind of intelligent design that dembski presents namely that god interacts and design the nature all the time is why then he design crippled people hiv virus an so on all the time dembski just brush those with such objections off by calling them unscientific if dembski instead had advocated that god started it all by shooting a billiard ball with a very precision that interacted with other balls that fine tuned the universe and started the evolution that eventually ended up with the complicated human being dembski could have accepted naturalism as well as intelligent design and then nature could have been responsible at least in some way for it s mishaps instead of blaming god as dembskis theories leads towards though he denies it in this book dembski claims to represent among others the of the people in the united states who believe that some kind of transcendent force created the world i believe the same but fear that books like this more destroy than helps to make a bridge between science and theology 
pages are too many quigley was a georgetown professor who was permitted access for two years in the early s to the private archives of the committee on foreign relations a rockefeller internationalist organization that compliments the work of the trilateral commission and the royal institute of international affairs it is difficult to determine what the author is trying to communicate there is no continuity to the book nothing ties together quigley s version of the past and of the future it s like reading about the solar system and finding out that the conclusion of the matter is that the sun will expand and burn everything up you are left wondering what is the point we are left with the suggestion that the elite should continue to guide us in the same direction that we are traveling but avoiding some of the monumental blunders that they have made in the past quigleys version of history consists mostly of unquestioning repetition of propaganda quigley did a superficial job of analyzing history and he is even worse at sociology he touts inclusive diversity as our great strength and greatest gift perhaps he should have considered the aphorism divide and conquer the west or any other empire can only flourish when it concentrates on matters of common concern not divisivnessquigley does slightly better with economics and foreign policy which are more in his area of expertise he correctly observes that british and american victories in wwi and wwii resulted in the almost total destruction of international law quigley is in favor of the idea of continental blocs replacing national states as globalization unfolds quigley exposes some of the hypocrisy and bungling yet he inexplicably remains committed to the overall plan so what is the point of all of this costly meddling quigley predicts success and then failure we shall undoubtedly get a universal empire in which the u s will rule most of western civilization this will be followed by a period of decay and ultimately by invasions and the total destruction of western culture couldn t we save ourselves the trouble and just mind our own business minding our own business is a concept based on the idea that the electorate is in control of the government and that we have a choice however quigley admits that international financiers influence and control governments quigley says that the internationalists who prefer to remain in the background should be known for their valuable contributions what these contributions amount to is that they want world government and they intend to cram it down everyone s throats as we slouch toward financial industrial and government monopoly the author reminds us of some of the casualties as economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another the freedom individualism and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy have to be sacrificed quigley acknowledges that in our future in general there will be a very considerable modification of the areas and objectives of freedom in all societies of the world with gradual reduction of numerous personal freedoms of the past to add to this loss of freedom quigley bemoans our loss of a spiritual mooring and suggests a return to the values of christianity ! his version of christianity of course still full of contradictions quigley cleaves to relativism rather than absolutes approximations rather than final answers not realizing that the adoption of these mindsets are what weakened the appeal of christianity finally as we follow our present course quigley predicts an age of conflict characterized by class struggle war irrationality and declining progress obviously we re there now rather than attack his sponsors who are bringing us this new world order quigley vents his frustration on the middle class quigley touts the moral superiority of both the rich and poor but he asserts that the middle class consists of poorly informed neurotic bourgeois radical right republicans worst of all they have puritanical attitudes toward sex the many internal contradictions in this book indicate a confused mind or a shallow thinker the author s history is mostly stale propaganda spiced up with occasional pro government cheerleading or tales of government boondoggles maybe if quigley had broken this monstrosity into several different books he would have had something coherent to say in this book quigley s conclusion is almost totally divorced from the rest of the book this effort spanned years and possibly senility was sneaking up on the author 
got insomnia this is an interesting subject but it is way out weighed by the turgid writing 
easy money maker for author since their are not many digital photography books for instructors they pick what they think will fit the bill its irritating when they don t even look at the book before requiring it the book is o k butshould not be used for a textbook ! it s insulting to anyone interested inphotography keep this in mind photography books especiallythe old and true and info on the internet will teach you the basics because photography is mainly digital it is very well suited for self study don t waste your time buying required marginal books and paying for photography classes your money will be better spend on good glass lenses and a tripod and of course learn photoshop just my opinionon a friday night 
help i have not recieved either book yet you ask me to write a review for 
terrible book oh my all the terrible reviews for this book are true ms steel is excessively repetitive i mean excessive ms steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over you get the picture i too found myself saying okay we get it already i also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had i don t know the men ms steel knows and hangs out with but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them oh please no man on earth talks that way especially to other men this book is completely aweful the plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention i have read many of ms steel s books and i believe this one is her worst i have now started reading sandra brown and she is sooo much better i recommend the alibi so far that has been my favorite by her she has mystery suspense romance her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than ms steels to sum it up i was completely disappointed with the book toxic bachelors i highly recommend sandra brown she is a much better author 
some useful information i am building my own house and find myself frequently referring to this book there is much useful information i only wish it were more up todate it was published years ago but much of the info was out dated even then and plumbing isn t exactly a rapidly changing field the sad thing is that there aren t really any books out there that are much better there is some info that is just plain wrong i followed the book s instruction to use s to keep my sewer line from sloping more than per foot at great effort and expense turns out it is not required just an old plumber s legend be careful about following any of the advice in this book does anyone still use cast iron or copper dwv pipe the book specifies a kelly fitting for cleanouts is there any code which still allows that can you even buy a kelly fitting most houses in the faster growing parts of the country are slab ongrade and have been for years but this book only devotes a few pages to this new concept if you buy this book you need to be aware that much about plumbing is regional and code specific and much of this book was out of date before it was published it can still be a good source of info if you keep that in mind 
remember this is the old version having not seen the orginal rudolph tv show in a very long time i forgot what the story line was remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child there are a couple of scary illustrations in this book my year old was in love with the rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with rudolph again because he said he didnt like the scary snowman yes i know it s a classic but be warned

bovine scatology this appears to be an attempt to see how many lies per minute can be put in print both the text and author are a waste of your time 
betty s not what she used to be time was when the words betty crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks although the books recipes for better or for worse were always a product of their times the very first betty crocker picture cook book was published in still available revolutionized how cookbooks were produced and was an enormous best seller the recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company s kitchens and in homes across america this was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages this gradually changed as betty and her books became more and more of a shill for general mills products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company s bottom line but to the detriment of good cooking the two all purpose cookbooks that came out in and were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips helps although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience especially in the edition but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes if you have one of these books treasure and keep it you ll never see their likes again the current th edition looks good but like the past several editions the number of recipes has been drastically reduced gone are the many variations which are especially missed in baked goods it was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from now way too many recipes are of the dump and stir method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results also gone is the very friendly assuring conversationial voice of yesteryear yes there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles but they are mostly stripped down versions its obvious that the folks at betty crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can t be bothered with proper preparation of dishes which begs the question of why general mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore the better homes and gardens new cookbook is a better bet for those looking for an all purpose everyday guide it has a better layout the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality and there are more recipes and variations than betty crocker s had in some time even better if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family i highly recommend the cookbooks of cooks illustrated americas test kitchen their comparable general purpose cookbook is called the america s test kitchen family cookbook the recipes are tested and reworked dozens of times if necessary to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them it s a shame that betty crocker has abdicated her throne and good name but there s even better stuff out there now go for it !

terrible book what a waste of paper some people should abstain from writing and pinnock is one of them 
oj should hire posner this book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the warren commission posner saw an opportunity to take their money and he took it good for him i m sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe oj was innocent he d write that book too with all sorts of convincing scientific evidence take a look at weisberg s case open if you can find it for documentation of some of posner s more amusing misrepresentations 
good information about the fbi but not a guide to employment this book serves a good purpose by giving the reader a general history of the fbi and some war stories of some agents but the title is misleading fully of this book have nothing to do with a guide to employment with the fbi the which does deal with this subject is almost taken verbatim from the fbi s employment website and consists of generalized statements not too much help here 
whewww ! not for me a friend of mine who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me highly recommended this book i made it about fifty pages before the confusion depression and disinterest forced me to cast it aside the book just made me disoriented and tired 
avoid this one the original changewave investing came out in at the height of the dot com boom the book touted the new economy or techonomy and how the future for investors in this area has never been better talk about bad timing and terrible advice in the late s almost anybody could make money in the market especially if one was invested in technology and everyone thought they were geniuses this euphoria seems to have afflicted mr smith taking his advice when the book came out would have resuted in significant losses since was the peak of that market and years later it still hasn t recovered along comes cw in with the added protecting your gains in a volatile market as he still raves about the techonomy hmmm when i make investment or trading decisions i listen to those who actually know what they re talking about with a proven and consistent track record tobin smith s record is dubious at best so if you really want to get a hold of your finances and become an excellent and astute investor start with the greatest investors of our time warren buffett george soros jim rogers and peter lynch look at their histories methods and commentaries it will be far more insightful than a misguided book full of made up words ridiculous projections and bad ideas 
ugh while i only am a little over half way through this book i m finding myself hating will he s pathetic and boring and not at all a character that i can cheer for this book has been a tedious read overall i keep pushing through because i feel like it has to get better yet so far it has not i m happy that i checked this out from the library so that i can return it and not have it collect dust on my shelves the only reason why i m even writing a review is that i m so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far i looked on amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others i m surprised that they are not i usually like this genre of fiction but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self loathing 
boooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggggg inticing beginning but quickly drops off into the most dull details of useless information even the ending was dull and in my opinion and unfinished 
average romance novel i m a nora roberts fan so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to after reading born in fire i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in born in ice brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they can t create further conflict even if she burns with anger inside she s very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story she thinks she ll never have what she dreams of she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess she s always hospitable to her guests she s a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden two places she loves to be although she s surrounded by folks who love her she s still lonely and then comes grayson the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland he s one who lives in the moment ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create the characters compliment each other well they re both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they didn t feel loved she s comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he s not that s where the conflict comes to play and that s kinda where i ve got a problem with the book this is supposed to be a guy who doesn t want emotional ties yet early in the book he s already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her there simply wasn t enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down there was very little if any sexual tension here and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed and even then it seemed like he wasn t really fighting himself for being there there simply wasn t enough of an inner conflict within him it all seemed like lukewarm resistance and brianna was simply a saint i would have liked to see her emote a little more i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts but i don t think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end i will say that the ending was sweet also it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from born in fire id recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer s imagination as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect however if you re looking for a cant put down romance novel this ain t it 
another awful book let me start by saying that i would have given this book zero stars if i could the reviews i ve read are all true this book is boring extremely repetitive and a waste of time the only reason i finished it was because i paid for it i truly believe that danielle steel has lost her gift of writing she has not published a good book in a long time i also think that she s lost her editor because to me a good editor wouldn t let books like this be printed this story pretty much follows stories she s done before except it s told from the guy s point of view there s the rich guy charlie who can t seem to find the perfect girl to marry he finds a flaw with every one he dates he lost his parents at a young age his sister left school to raise him and just before he graduated college she died of a brain tumor so of course he s afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him then there s rich adam whose wife left him and took their two children with her it was a bitter divorce so he has no desire to ever marry again he dates girls half his age and never stays with one long his parents blame him for the divorce every time he visits them his mother let s him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family the last of the trio is gary a struggling artist he has no desire to ever marry or date the three men spend the month of august each year on charlie s yacht partying and going on and on about how they don t want commitments well of course each one meets someone they start to date they argue they break up they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after same old story danielle steel should stop writing you can t tell me she doesn t have enough money to live on i for one will not read any more of her books even a paperback and i won t even bother renting them from the library i won t waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time there are better authors available and i m going to read them 
author is not very smart after reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about very close minded and not open to any changes at the end you will be like whatever 
useless this is a bizzar of prorietary code tradestation language and yrs old fortran code at the appendix i am wondering who will be using this code lot of spaghetti mathematics which is neither simple focussing on concepts nor deep enough to understant the mathematical details that s very poorly presented in chapter about uncovering cycles after all the poorly written mathematical stuff there is no mention on how to use the uncovered cycles in trading which is much more important than running after sines and cosines although i am a computer engineer with mathematical background i got lost i am forced to read this book as a reading material for cmt certificate however i consider it a very badly written book with no real focus neither elegant mathematical details nor usable code nor trading concepts 
not recommended yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn t know how to write my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author s alternative grammatical rules comma splices and run on sentences are not and never will be acceptable to me occasional use can be overlooked but shaara peppers every page with them tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading the following example is made up but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes he turned in the saddle rode toward his headquarters over the ridge refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance focused instead on the day ahead forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run on sentences in a row like this the result is a book that reads like a rough draft or maybe not even that it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft i don t understand how authors get away with publishing such half finished work and i don t understand why readers put up with it another problem is the lack of convincing characterization everyone is vaguely noble here with the exception of a few complete cads washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home i think you get the picture few characters stand out on their own even lafayette is just another young officer the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book and shaara s attempts at making his characters witty never work the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull beyond that i m doubtful about the author s device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter it s fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin s mind but the rest of the time it doesn t work well i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus either i m a lazy reader and i m not or the device isn t working well in addition this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france and washington green cornwallis and howe in america that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england and the continental congress in america in effect this novel is really about washington s military camp and howe s dinner table which makes the narrative unbalanced some aspects of the story are interesting i enjoy reading about washington s maneuvers and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were and when but i wish now that i d just bought a decent beginner s history on the war most of the book as literary fiction left me cold 
not the best self help the self improvement books how to win friends and influence people and talking the winner s way are both way superior to this short book most of what you read is basically review if you ve ready other similar books and what s present doesn t pack enough substance or quothow to quot to make it really worth your time about half way through the book gabor started presenting fresh ideas the problem however is that it was half way through the book not a bad read but there s so much better if you happen across it one day on the street it won t do any harm to read it but i can t recommend paying money for something you already know or can get for a better deal 
this girl thinks too much the title and cover page of this book provided a great deal of promise unfortunately the contents delivered very little pleasure pierson waxes on way too much on the philosophy of life as opposed to just riding motorcycles for the love of them like the rest of us the book drifts from the history of motorcycles to the complicated woes of her own personal life two trains of thought that she trys to run parrallel throughout the book but fails sorry i could only reccomend that you pass on this one 
avoid only to be used if you want to learn to converse a bit in japanese i used this for couple weeks and i found that japanese step by step an innovative approach to speaking and reading japanese is a better option 
it s a crime that this book is still for sale the publishers should be sued maybe we should get a class action together imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first apple computer and putting a new title on it how to use your new home computer and selling it in bookstores today this book is doing exactly that also it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place the author s website vanished years ago in a thinly traded nyse stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with share orders he will simply move the price cents against you immediately following your next purchase game over 
absolutely nothing new i too have the photoshop edition of this book and i could not be more disappointed same actions same text same pictures same everything this is close to criminal 
well i can t believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this what s the world coming to 
hug away your homosexuality this book is absolutely not about science the book completely ignores or dismisses a number of studies that have been done by christian and secular therapists most of them straight who have shown that most homosexuals are happy and that many are very capable in spite of society s inability still to fully accept them to form lasting and loving relationships this book also doesn t mention the number of studies done very recently that show that the children of homosexuals grow up no better or worse than those of heterosexual couples although i think it s important to mention these things this book is about a sect of christianity that truly believes it is immoral not to be gay mind you but for homosexuals to seek romantic love with each other this idea of immorality is the mindset that doctors nicolosi and socarides a co founder of narth who has a gay son start with when they perform their research and this is the mindset of almost all who are involved with the ex gay movement in this book chad uses a list of numbers and percentages in an effort to show that most gay men have problems in their relationships with their fathers one problem here if you look close enough is that he offers no comparable numbers for straight men the most glaring error with this conclusion however is that nowhere in this list of numbers are we told exactly when the gay men developed these poor relationships with their fathers this is important because most therapists agree that sexual orientation is set in the very early years of life some say by the age of however most gay men don t develop poor relationships with their fathers until much later in life in their teens or even later these kinds of things happen frequently in chad s book though he appears so eager to spread his message of change that the search for truth gets lost in the process the only real disturbing thing about chad s message book is that he maintains change is open to anyone who wants it this statement however flies in the face of all available evidence from mainstream psychologists and narth the success rate for reparative therapy varies anywhere from depending on who you talk to some recent evidence suggests that the success rate is well below this means that a vast majority of individuals who seek this type of therapy and who i assume really want to change are not able to this has also led to the ex ex gay movement which is interesting in its own right the advocates of reparative therapy see these failures and put the blame on the patient saying that they just didn t try hard enough which seems really sad to me most psychologists worth their salt would admit that they don t fully understand sexuality yet scientists are pretty sure as chad says that it is formed by a combination of genes and environmental factors this applies to hetero as well as homo sexual orientations the difference between all mainstream doctors and therapists and those who belong to narth is that narth claims it does know the reason for homosexuality or rather reasons and chad s book gives us a laundry list of those things that narth s proponents claim cause homosexuality none of which are backed up by peer studies i will never go so far as to claim that chad hasn t changed i believe at the very least that he believes he has changed the mind is a very powerful thing when we want something badly enough another aspect of sexual orientation that is not discussed in this book is that orientations seem to be more fluid than they are static some people lead straight lives for awhile then realize they are really gay or at least they are more attracted to men than women this happens in reverse as well some men begin dating other men and find out later in life that they are really more attracted to the opposite sex all of this can and does happen without prayer or the intervention of a few christian therapists and evangelists with a political moral agenda to push not that chad has a political agenda i think his message is well intentioned and free of politics but the people who frequently sponsor chad and the rest of the ex gay movement do have a political agenda and they are serious and determined to undermine gay people and their search for equal rights chads overview of the apa s decision to remove homosexuality from the list of psychological diseases is far too simplistic and doesn t take into account a number of things going on at the time like the very anti gay atmosphere that existed in the group or the fact that it took the group a full year of discussing the issue before it was pulled from the dsm i would like to write more but i only hope that people will appreciate and respect chad s message but not take everything he has to say as gospel 
not a book i would recommend for tequila aficionados in my opinion to flashy they are only taking advantage of the popularity of tequila you can not even find it in mexico i would recommend much more books like the book of tequila by mr emmons with real facts and tequila information 
didn t do it for me the author writes well but the stories are just a little too absurd to be interesting the first story is quite good but the rest become quite boring very quickly i think the writers talents would be better suited for a much longer work where she can develop the stories a bit further 
difficult read i am an avid reader and i will finish a book no matter how difficult it is or how boring it is and i couldn t finish this one it was so dry and i couldn t connect with any of the characters i was really disappointed 
not useful nobody questions that feynman was one of the great physicists of the th century in my lifetime perhaps only gell mann was more accomplished in his results of physics this review however is not about feynman the physicist but rather feynman the author of textbooks which purportedly try to teach physics at this he has categorically failed for a person that initially knows very little physics 
tired rehash i m not sure there is anything here that was not originally in simple abundance save for the description of her recent moves and marriage it all fees so s and i feel just the opposite of the person who said she likes the way the author quotes a lot of other writers in the text it breaks up the narrative and feels like filler i m glad i just looked at this in barnes and noble and decided not to buy 
better to watch the films instead this is not a biography but rather a discussion of each of hitchcock s films for each film there is detailed synopsis cast and crew details analysis of the filmthese first two of these items can be obtained from the internet for free and who really wants to know the details of the story anyway the analysis of each film is largely a waste of time as spoto tends to over analyse each film to the point of distraction while offering no real insights if you want to find out more about hitchcock s films i would recommend mcgilligan s excellent biography this discusses each film in the context of hitchcock s life and career and is far more illuminating 
hated it i did not like this book at all ! it was all over the place and i couldn t get in to it 
arrogant and annoying i recently purchased this book on the advice from a fellow photographer that critiqued my work as an amatuer photographer he said that this book helped him personally in his photography i m half way down with this book and find fielder unappreciative of his ability i agree that he is a good photographer but the way he explains his photos is annoying on a decent photo he will go into detail about the composition and how you eye flows across the picture sorry but some of the photos he describes are not as good as he thinks if you are looking for a quothowtoquot book don t pick this one try john shaw s nature photography and you will get your moneies worth 
really lousy attempt at depth and humor this is the kind of garbage they teach you to write in college imitations of what s on the shelf right now only smarter which really just means condescending to those not born with a silver spoon in ultrawhite marin county but you shouldn t be surprised the authoress also writes a blog which is just as bloated with self absorption even if she wants to pretend this is a novel novels have plots honey bypass this and read some dorothy parker instea 
poor even for a statistics book i found this book to be poorly organized and poorly written within the chapters the authors jump around between problems text definitions etc the text was poorly written and unhelpful from a layman s point of view i found the book unhelpful for learning statistics and wouldn t recommend it 
just wondering if anyone realizes that if koreans in north korea at the time before the russians came that if you were korean in north korea that you needed to speak japanese or you would be extremely punished 
a good but biased introduction to globalization in this work bhagwati offers valid arguments for globalization he is takes some of the strongest criticisms of globalization and is able to find fault in them and at the same time declares the benefits of a globalized economy however one need not read the entire book to find out bhagwati s views bhagwati s stance on globalization is almost so extreme that he instinctively and automatically comes to the defense of globalization without providing a fair analysis as a harvard professor i would assume him to provide more academic and holistic defenses and criticisms however his book is an easy read and one that opens the reader to arguments for and against globalization whether s he has previous knowledge of globalization or not

dissapointed i watched this movie in religion and was dissapointed that it didn t follow the book i read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available but now seeing this one again im pretty sure i saw this before i was annoyed at how much it changed the book i think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties the way mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous also i don t like colin s strange fortune teller like air i had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn t even remotely resemble the children don t get this version if your a purist 
character assassination while there were some interesting bits in this book and it was readable for the most part it completely undermined the character of raistlin contradicts previous books and is generally annoying 
zuh how germaine greer came to be an authority on shakespeare i ll never know actually i can t believe people are still writing about this guy at all 
lemony turns sour i don t know about anyone else but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series this is the most boring one of them all in my opinion and well how many times can the same story be told bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children children figure it out but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything even when it s pointed out to them times 
the unaware zapruder filmed a closed set staged event it was filmed before a live audience when some of the witnesses didn t respond to the gunshots and the aftermath it just adds credence to a vast conspiracy theory zapruder handed over the film and had to legally fight to get it back the filmed shooting clearly shows the upper right side of jfk s head being removed sowhy were the released autopsy photos showing an exit wound having grazed the very top right side of jfk s head two top autopsy doctors reported that jfk s top right side and brain were imploded and expeled onto the limo s trunk latertheir stories were recanted and rectified to stating that kennedy s brain was removed and stored for further examination when rfk found out about this he ordered it returned yetthe doctors then stated the jfk brain was now lost and misplaced it appears that the cia monkeyed with the zapruder film by removing some frames the film clearly shows jfk being hit from the back reaching for his throat bullit possibly going forward to hit connelly s back scapula and raising wrist all body hits in a split second at close range and at street level the close range shot did not impede the bullit s progress this adds support to a police escourt shooter being involved zapruder seemed shakened by the whole experience i think some of audience at the ford s theatre also knew the evening s comedy would unfold into live tragedy before their very eyes 
quite probably the worse dl book ever released really i d give negative stars if it was possible before i get going i d like to point out that i ve always liked douglas niles s dl works the last thane aside in particular i d recommend fistandantilus reborn the kinslayer wars and emperor of ansalon as excellent examples of how good a writer her can be in this setting even if each has slight flaws they don t add up enough to detract from the book in wizard s conclave it seems like all there are are flaws as far as the issue of dalamar the dark s hair color he was killed and resurrected the shock of that could have bleached his hair it happens in real life sometimes when people experience a severe trauma that was the least of it in my mind for starters the heroine coryn was far too naive and stupid throughout the book the idea that a kender could just show up in icereach of all places without being a god as in the icewall trilogy at scharon s door and guide a year old girl to palanthas without incident is ludicrous plain and simple any ship they took would have had to pass close enough to the gale off the coast of southern ergoth to experience negative weather patterns from its fallout yet we hear nothing of a storm tossed ship or anything just smooth sailing secondly the tower of high sorcery in wayreth has a whole big piece of source material on it raistlins legacy the tower of high sorcery that was readily available to mr niles that he apparently didn t look at once wayreth forest is just that a forest no caves no mountains no secret tunnels ! it is guarded by a copper dragon not some massive green holdover from the third dragon war it is also a structure that cannot be harmed raistlin in test of the twins was a god in an alternate future and even his divine power couldn t harm it never mind some wild magic the villain was in a word boring the writing was kiddie he should have named coryn harriet potter and just have been done with it and there were so many problems that they got in the way of telling a good story not the least of which is the idea that every wizard had the fly spell memorized for every day use or that they suddenly had a full compliment of spells after years of having no access to them oh and lest i forget they made good time from all corners of the continent all arriving at the same exact time the day after the night of the eye i wasn t aware ansalon had leer jets the master of the tower has his own form but it was not once used and is more powerful than just about any wizard because he is the tower why he didn t lock the villain and his toadying sidekick in a room and allow them to suffocate is beyond me the tower s physical layout was incorrectly described or should i say incompletely described no mention was made of where the fence went from the foretower and for all of coryn s unbelievable literally powers she had to use her little copycat spell on that arrow to win what about oh i dunno casting a haste spell on the arrow so it would get there before kalwhatshisname had time to turn around was there anything about this book i liked yes actually i liked that jenna became the head of the conclave even if she s far too old to have withstood the punishment she took she was no spring chicken in dragons of summer flame as it was yet here she is years later and still running around like she was in the prime of her life even elminster would have a problem bouncing back from the kind of injuries she sustained the best part though was the scene with palin and dalamar i felt that it was an excellent closing of the book on the majere family linsha aside and their involvement with the future of krynn palin sacrificed magic at the end of the war of souls trilogy and in this book released shortly after prisoner of haven and thus a great piece of loose endtying we see him happy for the first time in years a family that rose from peaceful common stock returns to peaceful common stock a great way to bring their saga full circle in short though mr niles took far too many liberties with the story not the least of which was betraying the tone of dl with a kiddie fantasy story dialogue sequences and pace as i said though i like doug niles s dl stuff by and large and will just be forced to file this in the miss category for him which is still far outnumberd by his hits i really hope that he phoned this in due to personal feelings towards the story idea and the supposed story arc that is supposed to come with it coryn is rumored to feature prominently in his upcoming trilogy i can only hope he doesn t continue the trend established in this book but rather takes the story seriously and attempts to make the read not only fun but worthwhile as well 
forget the racism argument what about the drownings executions burnings at the stake suffocations racism is not the problem with this book sure chinese brothers look alike maybe they look alike because they are brothers not because they are chinese i bought this book because generally i love the books written in earlier times they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time this book does have engaging illustrations what i find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet a little boy drowns never to be seen again one brother is tried arrested and sentenced to have his head cut off the people of the village assemble in the village to witness the execution where the executioner took his sword and struck a mighty blow the next brother was sentenced to be drowned and was thrown overboard from a boat the next brother is sentenced to be burned alive he was tied up to a stake and set fire the next brother is sentenced to be suffocated he s shovelled into an oventhis is no more appropriate for a child or adult for that matter in than it is in now a lot of you are probably thinking i m one of those mothers who just needs to get a sense of humour and lighten up i m not i love the giving tree and can put naughty eloise and the smoking nanny in context as i can many other books that polarise readers i really wanted to like this book but trust me if you buy it you will have lots of uncomfortable explaining to do to a young child an eight year old may be able to put it in context but there is no way you should read this to a four year old if you want a great book written in the s buy ferdinand the bull instead it s a fantastic book 
not smart or low carb i picked up this book because of rodale s reputation for excellence however this one s a real disappointment the recipes are not low carb and the nutritional data doesn t add up correctly for many of them and it s hardly smart since when is half a bagel a quotsmartquot choice or half a cookie and who can eat half that s like giving half a cigarette to a chain smoker and calling it a quotsmart choice quot no pass on this one there are so many really good choices now that purchasing this one would not be very quotsmartquot i would suggest dr atkins and the drs eades programs that are backed by research clinical documentation and a great track record for success 
kaffeeklatsch with a curious housewife after following oprah s book club i came to the sad conclusion that my gender woman cannot write period ! oprah s book club is a booster for the book printing industry now drowning in an avalanche of incompetent female writers a disaster for the american culture she promotes female writers who due to the lack of brilliance cannot write themselves safely out of a telephone booth though warned i purchased the above book because the subject of this book has stirred my interest greatly noticing an ocean of burning candles always at the altar of the black madonna in the theatiner cathedral of munich i learned that she is a replica of the famous loreto madonna of italy there are many more black madonnas throughout europe than encountered in china galland s path in kaffeeklatsch style she narrates her trips to other continents in pursuit of the black madonna and fails her attempt to fit the peaces of her puzzle together to a coherent picture in her travels she visits auschwitz birkenau and makes politically correct statements which are historically incorrect hitler was popularly elected hitler was appointed chancellor by president hindenburg in what does this have to do with longing for darkness the author is safest when she quotes copies men who have done research on her subject the origin of the black madonna throughout history and only when quoting others does her book gain some merit i give her a star for being industrious however skip this book ! i highly recommend for readers interested in this subject the cult of the black virgin by ean begg 
the afghan sorry have saved for my trip to the far east starting next week 
as authentic as a daytime soap opera i d heard the buzz both pro and con and thought i d take an independent read i was dismayed with this book james frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had one of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the truth so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him lies are what enable slips and enabling and denial and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure recovery is nearly impossible without honesty so can we look at this man s memoir and expect it to offer anything of value it s poorly constructed repetitive and narcisitic even if oprah hadn t exposed him the writing takes the tone of whoppers like frey s account of the drug house visit in which he rescues lilly other reviewers and smoking gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one and i can t improve on that suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life the same way a million little pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction a real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result i was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept like a joke of some kind i m not laughing 
disappointing i ve read several other mysteries by this author but was quite disappointed in this one the writing seemed paddedie paragraph after paragraph that did nothing to advance the plot the plot itself was okay but certainly not exceptional and some of it wasn t even believable for example although there was some explanation for the seemingly total imcompetence by the local police department understaffing the idea that even a rookie much less the police chief would miss so many of the pertinent and obvious clues that an untrained yr old shop owner ferreted out seems more than a little farfetched another part of the plot that strained even the most willing suspension of disbelief is the handling of the dv incidents by the police again only the most incompetent of professionals would have handled the case they way it was all in all this novel was not one i d recommend to anyone 
too many animals and blankets i bought the book because i liked the title but was very disappointed the book has too many animals and baby blankets and few really clothes for children the title promises more i have knitted one of the sweaters but i am not inspired to knit anymore from this book the layout could have been good if the drawings had been better gret 
great book terrible edition don t take the star rating wrong this is as good as any of the other books in this series but this edition quiet vision publishing paperback printed in is the cheapest printing of a book i ve ever seen only about pages into it pages started falling out of the back the type is huge and goes all the way to the edge of the page so your thumbs are constantly in the way while you re trying to read and there are typographical errors like using two hyphens instead of em dashes i know they make an electronic version of this book as part of my job i convert a lot of print intended content to digital publishing formats and that s what usually happens to em dashes during that process so i almost wonder if they just printed out their digital version and bound it it looks like it was printed on a laser printer especially the terrible cover illustration which looks like it was drawn by a year old and the fonts look like they re just pc standard times there are also several footnotes which in the original edition that i read years ago were placed at the bottom of the page they were referenced from in this edition they re in the back of the book 
an aggressive attack on research and scholarship media violence and its effect on aggression is a very peculiar book it is written in the style of h l mencken but without the scholarship and care the book is a biased attack on the science of psychology the profession of communications and the common sense of any educated reader 
truly horrendous this is a poorly reasoned simplistic screed of a book it reads more like a fundraising letter than an actual piece of analysis or reporting regarding what is a very interesting subject and one worthy of a decent book this one is not it at best it is the type of book written purely to gain entry onto cable news programs as an quotexpertquot no one really cares what is in it or whether it makes sense or not one thing is for certain the book does not advance the ball on this topic one iota 
don t buy me listen to all the other reviewers it s that bad i was at the airport facing a nice relaxing trip saw the book bought it despite the bad reviews on here thinking it can t be that horrible it is oh how beautiful is jason oh how beautiful is halle oh how dumb boring could a story be i only finished the book because of my long love of cc s books i should have found other things to do 
don t bother bennett has little if any understanding of children myths fables and fairy tales in this book he tries to bludgeon children into being good his version of it by terrorizing them that s not how stories for children work some of the stories here are butchered others are just plain bad you d be a lot better off by going to the original stories and avoiding this collection which is only useful for a door stop bennett wisely avoids stories about his substantial failings slot machines gluttony smoking booze hypocrisy thy name is bill bennett 
an honest opinion after reading this book and reading most of the posts i can say that the ones who disagree with s hannity stole my thoughts s hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else he never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain if you like controversy then buy bill o reilly and michelle malkin s books at least those two try their best to get their points across hannity s book is a waste of many even though it s only dollars you can buy two mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price 
an austrian primer this book s title is deceptive in that it suggests the author is going to examine the place of capitalism within formal catholic social thought sadly dr woods foregoes the opportunity to examine the teachings of the social magisterium in favor of the standard bromides of the austrian school admitting at the outset that he s no intention of bringing up the pronouncements of the popes throughout the ages he instead nit picks about the sorts of things which have traditionally annoyed austrians in most things woods follows the lead of others contributing nothing himself in the way of original analysis he acknowledges his intellectual debt to murray rothbard in the introduction and later on draws on rothbard s arguments concerning the th century scholastics some of whom wrote opinions in accord with austrianism unfortunately a few th century theologians does not the church make and it s of course silly to even think that these men grounded as they were in the thought of the angelic doctor would in any way endorse austrianism or the anarcho capitalism of murray rothbard it would be the equivalent of saying that the popes are austrian because they view private property as a pillar of society nonsense according to rothbard the error of thomists and all classical natural law theorists is that they viewed the state as a major locus of virtuous action elsewhere rothbard defines the state as a monopolistic criminal enterprise each of these views is well outside of the social magisterium no where will you find a pope who rejects the validity of the state since it holds authority by the will of god st paul addresses the state in romans not the all powerful market and he does not fall on the side of murray rothbard the errors of the non catholic rothbard on political issues are not enough to persuade woods that he s suspect as an authority in economics he clings instead all the more tightly to the luminaries of austrianism in a book ostensibly dedicated to catholic social teaching on economic concerns for myself if i detect a serious error in the realm of political theory on the part of a writer i become very cautious in following his lead in economic matters rothbard s political views are inseparable from his economic theory since the state exists solely to destroy the fruits of the market cf man economy state the supreme irony is that dr woods continues to defend the compatibility of austrianism and catholicism even against the condemnations of economic liberalism by popes like pius xi to whom woods appeals against the errors and confusion which have plagued the post conciliar church cf the great facade here pius xi addresses woods and his ilk in his encyclical letter ubi arcano dei many believe in or claim that they believe in and hold fast to catholic doctrine on such questions as social authority the right of owning private property on the relations between capital and labor on the rights of the laboring man on the relations between church and state religion and country on the relations between the different social classes on international relations on the rights of the holy see and the prerogatives of the roman pontiff and the episcopate on the social rights of jesus christ who is the creator redeemer and lord not only of individuals but of nations in spite of these protestations they speak write and what is more act as if it were not necessary any longer to follow or that they did not remain still in full force the teachings and solemn pronouncements which may be found in so many documents of the holy see and particularly in those written by leo xiii pius x and benedict xv there is a species of moral legal and social modernism which we condemn no less decidedly than we condemn theological modernism liberalism takes many forms in our own day most faithful catholics assume it is primarily concerned with corruptions of human sexuality in fact the popes remind the faithful that liberalism appears under varied guises dr woods evinces a poor philosophical foundation and he is easily taken in by all sorts of assumptions for example ludwig von mises critical inspiration to rothbard and other austrians claims in his work human action that praxeology is the science of every kind of human action rejecting any who would claim that his new science heretofore unknown to the doctors of the church is not limited to those actions which lead to an improvement in a man s material well being this claim of course is fundamentally at odds with st thomas and catholicism at both a natural and theological level from a thomistic perspective one wonders how anyone can have a perfect science of all human action that does not weigh good or bad actions this is true whether it s philosophical ethics or evangelical precepts the error of the past says mises is that philosophers like aristotle sought to explain human action by notions of good or bad just or unjust or even worse the interference of a deity instead human actions are not ordered by objective valuations but rather by the dictates of the market virtue and vice are subjective notions which have no place in economics if a man is to succeed says mises he must adjust his actions to economic law in his intro to human action he uses the example of a man who wants frequent sexual intercourse if he s going to get it he s going to have to know economics austrian economics not chicago economics elsewhere he quips that simple faith and economic rationalism cannot dwell together it is unthinkable that priests should govern entrepreneurs meaning the church has no business at all talking about the market the social magisterium is just so many opinions which may or may not be the correct way to establish a just and felicitous social order rothbardians would go further and say that the church can be ignored without moral peril whenever she posits the notion of a common good capable of being guarded by the state woods argues that economics is not a species of ethics but is instead a pure science studied in the same way that physics is by physicists as st thomas says external goods that are used purposively by men have a moral consideration it s precisely this ethical cast that mises and other austrians have sought to banish from economics the church has claimed the right to decide the moral lights which should guide christians in formulating a just economic order woods does not meditate upon the question of whether there is a moral calculus in the laws which the state passes to regulate the exchange of goods or in relations between labor and capital how can he his mentor rothbard had already taught that the state was criminal by nature so it follows that its decrees are only the threats of a crime syndicate having a monopoly on the use of violence rothbard took mises to his logical conclusion deciding that the market would necessarily find the most humane and efficient way to secure corporate goods with the state tagging along as an unwanted parasite woods uses the same line of thought in his discussion on safety regulations the market will always do a better job of implementing safety in the workplace than any public regulation because it is rational if an objective moral evil exists in the social order it cannot be addressed by a ruler or rulers the market is infallible and will eventually solve any problem whether it takes days or decades positive laws to remedy or palliate a condition are by definition always worse than doing nothing it s kind of like a doctor telling his patient to forego any treatment since death will eventually cure his illness woods wants us to accept that economics is a value free science a set of observations about the way things work in a world marred by scarcity at the same time he can t help dipping into moral considerations eg p predicating moral or immoral of certain economic choices in addition he favorably quotes the jesuit mariana who calls any ruler wicked who sets a price by edict mises and rothbard of course also resorted to various moral arguments when discoursing on economics their gift for moralistic psychologizing has been picked up by anarchists like hans hoppe at unlv the question is then whose morals guide the discussion are they catholic do they reflect the mind of the church in her magisterium and her liturgy cf the feast of christ the king the divine liturgy of st john chrysostom used by byzantine catholics is very un rothbardian the priest prays for the good of the civil authorities and the armed forces major no nos in murray rothbard s school of politico economic anarchy passages like peter become problematic at best candidates for expunging at worst to be deep in austrianism is to cease to be catholic at the very least we can dispense with the pretension that economics is just a pure science about the way things are this claim can also be found in fields like sociology and psychology it s foolish to predicate pure value neutrality of the political science but the economic man is a powerful myth so it happens that the whole science of economics gets a pass when it does this very thing the austrian school is a marginal school at best no pun intended with noble laureates and scholars coming from other schools like chicago the variety of theories would suggest that economics is a science in an equivocal sense only woods has repeatedly shown that he s out of his depth in tackling the question of the church and the market for those who accept woods thesis think more carefully about it after reading rothbard and mises both authors have good insights and much of what they write is reasonable when they discuss the minutiae but this book is nothing more than an austrian primer woods limits much of his effort to sniping at individuals like belloc heinrich pesch gets two whole pages even though he s hugely influential in th century catholic social thought one senses that woods is really only interested in regurgitating standard austrian doctrine we don t need this book for that purpose since many others have already been written a concise but potent antidote to austrian ideology is the recently released compendium of the social doctrine of the church unlike this book it actually delves into the heart of the church s teaching on economic political and cultural issues citations are copious and far ranging and alas authoritative 
the real act prep guide bad buy not what you are expecting i bought this book expecting to have some practice questions and some tutorials on the subject matter that i will inevitably have to face during the actual act the only thing that it really gave me was just the type of information that was going to be on the test but no workable problems or tutorial information on subjects that i have either never taken or am rusty at for lack of practice this book in my opinion was a waste of my money and did not fulfill the objective that i had previously expected it to 
the worst book i ve read this year i have read a lot of ds books and this is the worst one yet it was repetitive the story was totally mundane not even a little bit intriguing and the ending predictable i read it to the end hoping it was going to get better but it never did for a writer of her caliber and reputation she ought to know better the only good point it didn t take long to read this is the last ds book i ll ever buy 
jackie s wild seattle by danielle have you ever read a book that has a wildlife shelter a boy obsessed with natural disasters a girl that carried a pound seal on her back while rock climbing a lost racoon and an arrogant bear i didn t think so well now here s your chance with jackie s wild seattle while shannon and cody d parents are busy in afganistan working with docters without borders for the whole summer they have stay with their uncle neal in seattle during their visit because uncle neal volunteers at jackie s wild seattle a wildlife rescue organization the two kids get to explore wildlife in a new and closer way while they help their uncle save animals will hobbs writes this book in the perspective of shannon a year old girl who loves adventures and is a bit more practical then her younger brother cody cody is years old and loves animals and natural disasters uncle neal is very passionate for animals and is nice and welcoming to his niece and nephew but shannon has some suspicions about him she will not stop trying to figure out why he is not being open with them i really liked this book and i would recommend it to someone who liked animal and adventure novels since i am not much of an animal book lover i didn t like this book as much as some of my friends did but i enjoyed reading it 
why did i waste my time i ve stayed away from this series for a few years but chanced on the blow fly and thought i d give it another chance why ever did i even attempt it i ve missed a few in the series having given them up a few years ago but nothing has changed apparently kay s is as misunderstood but perfect as ever how a totally self centered and egotistical character could gain a following is beyond me her fan club of dysfunctional people continues to swarm round every one of the characters in the book is as demented as the criminals in the story and almost nothing happens in the book except her niece becomes a cold blooded murderer but no one seems to think this an inappropriate way to act im now hoping kay goes on the hunt for a terrorist and all her friends and associates somehow are blown to bits as a final installment i could go on with the many reasons why this book was such a waste but the book simply doesn t deserve that kind of time 
couldn t wait to put it down all the ingerdients for a satisying space opera put together as dull dull dull 
not worth reading this was a waste of my time ! i sat there and read about this boy and what he could do ! then read about more kids and what they were good at it should have another title about not labeling our kids or something not late talking children that makes me think that is going to help me with my late talker why was this even published i could go and write about my son and how he is sooo smart but doesn t talk yet wow you would really care ! 
not good for music appreciation text i ve used this book for three years and am eager to trade it for something else why musical examples are chosen seemingly because yudkin got tired of the tried andtrue favorites bach brandenburg concerti are not on the student cd set but the st matthew passion is as a result the students may get to hear bach brandenburg concerti in class but can t listen on their own same is true for verdi otello is included but not rigoletto or la traviata this text is written for the average music major not stellar just average rather than a music appreciation student he assumes much greater knowledge of instruments timbre texture and familiarity with general musical terms than any introductory student will have an exasperating dilemma many works on the instructor cd set are not on the student set despite those being the better selections why not put the obscure works on the instructor cds and let students have access to really great works for example when he selected a recording of a madrigal he picked one that has two females singing a verse then two males singing a verse nothing at all like of all madrigals students would ever be likely to hear the reason he knows the performers on the cd ! students never get to hear real text painting as every real madrigal illustrates it s hard to build on that when asking students to understand the concept of text painting anyway i m not yudkin bashing but there are definitely problems with this text that need to be addressed 
disappointing very disappointed in the book too much drama not enough history felt like i was reading the script from a made for tv docudrama 
interesting but while this is a well researched and thought provoking piece of literature i do have some critical comments to make firstly it is apparent that the author s own holocaust experiences or more specifically those of his family have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented secondly there is a lot of content to trawl through to get in my opinion a few pieces of interesting material finally the underlying theme or accusation that without ibm the holocaust may not have happened or would not have been so sever is again in my opinion flawed as the book shows ibm certainly made it much easier for the nazis to locate and identify jews it would not have been impossible without ibm having said all this it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading 
woefully lacking by far the least informative book i ve read on fibromyalgia it s far too simplfied and woefully incomplete for instance the most diffinitive diagnostic tool for fibromyalgia the pressure points is barely mentioned called quottender points quot in this book the location and description of these points how this test is correctly administered and the important of the test are missing without them you do not have fibromyalgia also i realize this book is quotfor dummies quot but give me a break no one is this simple more substance and a lot less fluff are needed even the writing is mediocre at best instead i strongly suggest you read quotinside fibromyalgia quot by mark j pellegrino md who has the condition himself this is my number one reference easy enough to understand but solid medically with accurate and sensible diagnostic and treatment help also quotliving well with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia quot by mary j shomon a patient herself is much better researched and better written than quotdummiesquot this is a serious subject and even a quotdummiesquot book should be more comprehensive than this ! 
these bleachers are hard i was very disappointed in this selection maybe a male football fanatic would find something appealing but i was very bored ! take me back to court to the lawyer s office to the judge s chambers just about anywhere but these bleachers ! 
horrible book this is another example of someone just throwing a book together in order to call themselves an author the drawings cannot be followed therefore the book is useless another wanabe master do yourself a favor and skip this book 
not soreal stews this book reveals just how precious and convoluted the process of cooking has become for the self consciously culinarily sophisticated as a previous reviewer has mentioned many of its recipes require obscure ingredients or time consuming procedures which when closely examined would appear to have been included for the sake of sheer novelty case in point the author asks the cook in several of the recipes to braid a rope from flour and water which is then placed inside the lid of the cooking pot ostensibly as a seal after cooking this rope is discarded since most well made casserole dishes or large stewpots include tight sealing lids this extra maneuver can only be viewed as the sort of one upsmanship beloved by upscale cooks with too much time on their hands likewise complex steps such as rendering one s own lard which the author requires the cook to do in more than one recipe or tracking down expensive obscure spices which will in all likelihood be used only once and then in minute quantity simply do not justify the time or effort involved the basic idea of a stew is to create a tasty satisfying one pot meal from available ingredients when it takes weeks to assemble the ingredients and more than a day to prepare the dish somebody is definitely missing the point another problem with real stews is its seeming obsession with the exotic over the familiar all cultures have delicious culinary traditions well at least most of them do but to insist that american cooks precisely duplicate the ingredients and cooking conditions necessary for ethnic verisimilitude smacks of snobbery at best and condescension at worst a little more emphasis on user friendly and dare it be said familiar recipes would have made this book considerably more useful as it is for most home cooks it s likely to gather considerable dust 
cumbersome i find it much more difficult to navigate this book than say moreland and fleisher s book of latin grammar furthermore it s verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate the author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion 
terribly subjective and superficial while this series is cute and useful to get a flavor of the differences between schools it cannot be used to compare schools apples to apples the comments themselves are revealing of the character of a school but the actual grades are meaningless particularly when assessing academic quality the consequence of subjective methodology since the students themselves who know only their institution give out the grades they simply don t have the information necessary to assess their school against peer institutions in an objective way so yes use it for entertainment but don t make decisions based on this flawed research methodology visit interview form your own opinion 
outdated and biased this book was published in five years have passed and there is no sign that china is about to collapse anytime soon the author was blinded by an inability to see substantial progresses behind the gloomy numbers he one sidedly presented take human right for example do you know that there are now hundreds of thousands of advocates fighting for the right of ordinary people in china if these advocates exist in the past they would have just been thrown into reformation camp for years yes nowadays these people are still harassed but the harassments have become more civil what a consolation you may say ! well laugh at it if you wish what i am trying to say is that we should not use an all ornothing kind of attitude when we look at china as a matter of fact many advocates would tell you that although they are harrased the government is listening to what they have to say and it does make essential adjustments based on these voices let s face it the hu s and the wen s of china are probably much smarter than mr chang and i venture that they probably care much more about the well being of china than mr chang or you or i the pragmatism of the current ccp government testifies to that another example is that mr chang s takes a very brief one in the last chapter on taiwan tibet and xinjiag are flatly wrong he seems to have thought that chen shui bian was a hero but alas ! time has proved that chen is a clown for your information his supporting rate has just dropped to an all time low george bush must be happy that someone over yonder is doing much worse than he does a few weeks ago and the pro independence force is shrinking as the pragmatism of the now energized kmt wins over more and more rational people as i write this review the kmt and the ccp are holding a forum in beijing and i have just read the excellent speeh of lien chan calling for more interactions and cooperations between the two sides mr chang could not have dreamed of this in as the ccp likes to say the tide of history cannot be resisted and finally let s not buy too much into what the falun gong people have to say about ccp and china their agenda is clear ccp is pure evil bring it down at all cost well these people are being consciously marginalized more and more by the mainstream chinese societies in and out of china because people do not perceive what they are doing to be beneficial to china china the people and the government needs to be constructively engaged not demonized keep your eyes open read more from asian news medias for they can provide a much needed counterbalance to the demonizing tendency coming from the west it will be better if you can read chinese then you will get a really good balance based on which you can judge the true state of the affair yourself if you only read the gordon chang s of the world i feel sorry for you and by the way forget about this book if you really want to read it do so with a critical attitude 
don t buy another crc book this is a partial copy of the mathworld material online at the wolfram research web site httpmathworldwolframcomit makes for a decent mathematical enclopedia but there are many others around which should be purchased instead look on amazon for reviews to most reasonable peoples thinking crc should not be allowed to make any money on this particular book the faq on the wolfram research web site q may i host a mirror site or create a personal mirror a no the material on this site is updated frequently and so any mirror would rapidly become out ofdate so if a mirror of the web site will soon be out of date it goes without saying the book will too now i am one of those people who like to have hard copies of books and would generally accept it might not be as up to date as the web i own a copy of the mathematica book despite it is all online for free but in this case given what crc did to weisstein and wolfram research i would not out of principal buy this book also i would suggest that nobody contributes to the wolfram research web site as crc get the copyright i use the material on there and find it useful but i would not write something so that crc can benifit as someone else said send weisstein then buy another book 
not the book to buy i cannot recommend this book each chapter is written by a different author or authors some of those chapters are extremely good others are very poor in fact portions of the book are the most difficult to read technical text i have ever seen in those areas gleaning the information needed for the cissp exam or any other purpose is difficult at best also there are some significant accuracy errors in some places i really believe your money is better spent on the shon harris cissp all inone exam guide third edition 
i don t care what critics say this book was horrific while it may have been well written this book is disturbing and disgusting to put it mildly if you or anyone you know are pregnant or contemplating or trying to have children do not read this book ! this is one book i can honestly say in retrospect i would rather have failed the test on than ever have read 
disappointing i love mollie katzen s earliest cookbooks moosewood and enchanted broccoli forest dishes i make from those are relatively easy and very tasty i have tried a lot of recipes in this cookbook and i have been very disappointed they just dont taste as good i have served some dishes from this cookbook which have remained uneaten on the table on the other hand when i use the other two people usually enjoy the food and ask me for the recipes i have learned my lesson and i don t use it anymore if you actually want to buy a cookbook which is a useful source of recipes i do not recommend this one 
only promises what it delivers in this book byron york only promises to present the evidence of a vast left wing conspiracy and that is all he presents the discussion here is limited to what left leaning money has done primarily this amounts to a muckraking castigation of george soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in bush administration policies and a denigration of soros concerns that the us is now currently moving in the same direction as nazi germany in the period between the world wars there is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle no reference to the vast amounts of amway devoss family money available to smear democrats and moderate republicans no reference to the vast amounts of walmart walton family or timkin timkin family money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax and absolutely no reference to the extremely close and extremely profitable relationships between george bush and ken lay enron or between george bush and jack abramoff republican corruption and treason 
disappointing while the characters of this story are engaging there s no follow through you don t really get an idea of what happens to people at the end you are left to your own imagination for a lot of instances i understand that it is christian fiction since it refers to numerous biblical quotes but we really don t get an idea of people s faith the people don t really seem to have a relationship with god i was truly disappointed 
interesting subject matter bad book the subject of the is book is very interesting so i struggled through to the end with plenty of skimming but this guy can t tell a story too dry too long no sense of style tayloe nicke 
not worth the tree to make the paper i must say selling a dated book like this when you re talking about websites is a shame sure some ideas might be timeless but this book uses poor example after poor example to make its point i read another web book called dont make me think just before this one i guess it would be like following elvis with a kindergarden play save your money need i say more 
for tru fans only the novel was a badly researched and badly written third rate airport thriller this illustrated edition is an expensive and attractive badly researched and badly written third rate airport thriller for tru fans only 
unbiblical and bad writing make for one star this book is so flawed in every which way it is hard to know where to begin first of all we are living in the end times and when jesus comes that s all she wrote folks there s no seven years no christians being zapped up etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true then what s the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to and then when people zap out of thin air change your life it s ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really don t think the author s care at this point seeing how many millions they ve made printing lies my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you ll get truth and the bible is probably shorter and much better writing man not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck 
where did ja jance go i own and have read all of ja jance s jp beaumont and joanna brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character s lives i picked this book up thinking it would be on par with all the ja jance books i ve read previously what a crashing disappointment i can t care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations truth be told i kept looking at the cover to see if i d picked up a harlequin by mistake i ll probably read more ali reynolds books if this is indeed a new series but i d much rather see what happens with jp and joanna incidentally i didn t think much of either of them either when their paths crossed some books ago this one gets a big aw c mon ja you can do much better than this from me for those who haven t read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first jaj get the jp beaumonts and start at the beginning they are worth the time and effort 
worst diet book ever although roizen and oz have a great premise here for loosing weight what they have to present gets lost in the presentation the book is full of idiotic quips that are redundant serve no purpose to the book are a distraction to the overall message of the book and at times were rather degrading while the quips are at first funny pages into the book it gets to be rather tiredsome and the diagrams and cartoons in the book didn t add to it at all the diagrams belonged more in an elementary school science book than in a book whose target audience is suppose to be adults the cartoons like the quips just got tiresome i was inspired to go out and buy this book after seeing the you on a diet show on tv i honestly thought the docs had something useful here unfortunately i was only able to make it half way through this book before having my fill of it as the diet was in the last part of the book i didn t quite make it that far and at this point i just don t have the stomach to open this book again as i mentioned before i do believe that roizen and oz have a good premise here however i just found this book to be too full of silly foolishness to be taken seriously as a diet book i am glad to see that it has worked for others i just wish these two had presented their material better as i was totally ready to give their ideas a serious try unfortunately i just don t think they were serious enough about their ideas for me to try them i don t recommend this book to any serious dieter if you want serious motivation a common sense plan and someone who will talk to you like the adult you are then i suggest any of bob green s books a very enjoyable read from which i gained enough motivation to lose pounds having reached a plateau that i am having a difficult time breaking i thought something new and different might be worth a shot you on a diet was definitely not new or different it was boring and degrading 
utter garbage i didn t find this funny satirical or humourous in any way poor drivel and a waste of time and brain matter 
corrupted analysis you ll never get the straight story about nationalism out of eric hobsbawm who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic david pryce jones once noted that in hobsbawm s own autobiography he hobsbawm boasts of a visit to bir zeit university on the west bank to display solidarity with the palestinians why palestinian nationalism is valid and jewish nationalism invalid is something else hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain quite crudely he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves communist and anti american like cuba or vietnam while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not communist and are pro american like israel jan such twisted thinking is evident through nations and nationalism where mr hobsbawm spares no effort however subtle to demean nationalism that doesn t conform to his pre existing prejudices in short when writing about nationalism mr hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion communism therefore unless you are an acolyte of that religion this book is not worth your time money or effort to read and if you are a member of that religion i suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit perhaps by reading liah greenfield s nationalism five roads to modernity or benedict anderson s imagined communities 
not worth the money the worst story is kenyon i will not buy any more in the future ! 
alright already this is a case of a lot of filler to make what could be communicated in a short essay into a book the basic message the music industry has to embrace digital technology this and a few other salient points are made early in the book and then repeated with different wording ad nauseum i would suggest standing in the store reading the introductory stuff and skimming the rest too many authors are doing this these days it should have been a magazine article 
star and for good reason take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily the advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong if you want to do really well do what others that are doing well are doing adopt the beliefs mannerisms attitude techniques ideas of who you wish to be like and you ll get the same results in other words don t copy john gray 
invented history although it is true that peoples had contacts through trade and therefore the sharing of ideas however megalithic structures on malta most likely are not connected to the british isles and vice versa httpsociologyesosciencecomindexhtml instead christopher knight and alan butler create a new myth like the british isles and brittany malta and israel have megalithic structures scattered across them and the old testament gives detailed evidence of how the canaanite rituals were adopted for king making the memory of these prehistoric secrets was transmitted by the remnants of the order of the knights templar who took their rituals to scotland at the beginning of the th century 
only if you have to i had to have this book for a class i took i found it difficult to track if you must buy it look for it used 
the silver kiss in my opionion the silver kiss was a good story its just i really didnt like how fast it went or how it ended but dont get me wrong it was a real page turner i couldnt wait to finish 
overindulgent narrative anyone hoping to encounter the same unflinching brilliance found in everything is illuminated will be sorely disappointed the narrative is tedious overindulgent and at times utter nonsense maybe that was the point in trying to make sense out of something senseless the attacks but the book all of its seemingly infinite arrangement of words and more words fails miserably i can t help but wonder what a gifted and brave editor could have made of this book as it is it s length and self indulgence made me not trust the narrative about midway through the book it became obvious to me that foer is enraptured with his own method of storytelling and thereby has no sense of when to leave a point that has been made or excise a character that is superfluous instead it gets belabored drawn out to the point where you feel as if he s chasing the horizon which of course just retreats at the same pace at which you pursue 
i m usually a heinlein fan but i love heinlein i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction i find that his plots and ideas are inventive even this story was inventive in many ways like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters however i found this book as a whole to be very boring much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters the quotmainquot characters of each section of the book aren t fully realized at all i wouldn t recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really really bored 
not to sure this book was a definite let down fo me this book was good but not terrific after reading best sellers like why we want you to be rich by donald trump and god doesn t run a shop by sage saint francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge i mean those two books changed my life and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone when deepak started to explain the law of karma it just struck me what lant is he from we would all like to believe and many do just as i did that the world has a scoring system that it keeps count and it rewards those and comes around to those accordingly yeah right let me tell you if me and the pope both stand outside in the rain we both get rained on ! the world does not play favorites and it does not discriminate i am talking about that something and the world does not discriminate people do basically since i woke up from this idealistic rubbish took off my rose coloured glasses i began to actaully get the results i want just look at princess di steve irwin and martin luthur king what happened to karma there ! this is badcially what the book is about as if there are laws yeah right wayne dyer says the bible says whats next this just isn t reality it is subjective idealism i do not feel this is the authors best work however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start 
get your nose out of your navel and see the world around you this man is another example of our over affluent society s attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good deepak chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided marin county yuppies sleep is important as is taking care of our bodies and minds but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this basic common sense drink a lot of water is sugar coated in pseudo spiritual jargon insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self helpjunkies and cult bait can t sleep use the bucks to buy a real book and read it in bed or buy a vibrator 
ouch i m a pagan and i do not hold this book in high esteem and there is plenty i could say about the book and its author i ve tried to do that in a couple of amazon reviews but they were deleted so if you really want to know what i think of this book you will have to e mail me 
sooo lifetime if you like this book you will probably like bless the child by cathy cash spellman they are very similar this book can be summed up in one word simple simple minded simple characters simple plot applied loosely and simple premise what a contrived piece of garbage i can t describe everything wrong with this book because there s not enough time if it s meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through if it s meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims in denial weak worried about what everyone thinks or oblivious if it s meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author s plea for that is irritating that s how bad this book is ! it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying this author has no style the book reads like an episode of inside edition there is no immersion into the story the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them as a reader i felt completely outside the story an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable i ve been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me do not waste your time i must say though that this novel was inspirational if this crap can make the best seller list it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
if i could give a i would do it i am a graduate student and a software developer with years of experience in the industry it may not sound like much but i believe i had experiences that allow me to form some semi solid opinion about it normally i would not bother leaving reviews but this product is out of bonds both the simulation and the book are very buggythe book is in effect a manual for the simulation it has contradicting ideas and statements all over i gave up reading the manual after pages it is not just my opinion my professor said not once that the book is a disaster many of my class mates expressed the same idea simulation itself is something of the same sort for example the whole project is broken down into periods with specific tasks in each period after decisions made by players teams the software posts results of a project period simulation the ultimate goal is to achieve the milestone at the end of each period now without much knowledge about the simulation which by the way is very hard to come by in the ambiguous book and simulation itself as you will see in a bit the question is how on earth you are supposed to plan ahead and build your strategies if the software tells you that a project team member s efficiency is for a particular task and the task is done within allowed time and the milestone is not achieved reasons for failures no they don t bother to explain if any of programmers or designers of the simproject read this i hope nobody will buy the product untill you fix your stuff ! nothing personal but the quality of your product is bad 
pages of torture would you stand in line at an applebee s for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good maybe better at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes of course not ! why then would you spend countless hours plowing through this page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books or a patterson and a connelly or two thomas harris books my apologies greg iles but for a simple formulaic serial killer book blood memory was just way too long the book has two co plots one involves a serial killer who murders older men the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting but at least two thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles or his editor had chopped out about pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for o or even pages but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera speak meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream taking showers and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it s some strange exotic treat that no one s ever heard of before just as some people love to hear themselves talk i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good blood memory misses the mark by a long shot 
profound disappointment perhaps i had been expecting a true sequeal to the original i was so excited when i saw the book but instead of a taut touching tale i got a rambling frequently boring difficult to follow story that i had to force myself to finish it seemed more a tale of politics and religious infighting than a science fiction story problems how about way too many characters many with multiple names i consider myself intelligent and widely read but the rush of people created such a flux that the plot seemed almost secondary i liked the hero but for all his potential he did little more than whine worry and wonder his boss the antipope became the star of the show along with the swordsman the story did not flow and bogged down several times in minor details the first section covereding the time in the abbey passed uneventfully but for a few personal crises then we journey toward the conclave and are introduced to host of new folks finally we arrive in the city and meet yet another cast of characters the story was as much about native american culture as anything the language issues interesting at first became tiresome as we switched from various dialects some almost unpronouncable with special symbols to latin frequently to english all in all not a success 
did you all actually read it first off i am an avid reader and love a long challenging read however this novel is one of the worst i have ever read ! it is long boring and has absolutely no plot i purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews although from the looks of most of them here i personally suspect that many of those who raved never actually read the book 
low end i study leadership politics in business organisations and emotional transactions i bought this book thinking it would be factual conclusive and real on the other hand i found it s written with a mocking tone has no relation to real cases and is as shallow as it gets it could be good for some peasant who believes he can get ahead at work easily but in reality there s far more than this book wastes time about 
too basic the three md s who authored sugar busters have discovered that sugar is bad but haven t learned about all the other horrendous things that have happened to the american food supply sugar contributes to disease they say sugar makes us gain weight and we should avoid it so far so good but turning to the meal plan we find a bewildering array of processed and denatured foods high glycemic whole grain extruded cereals like whole grain oat cheerios and shredded wheat n bran reduced fat triscuits lowfat milk products lite mayonnaise and msg laden worcestershire sauce kitchen bouquet browning sauce and canned chicken broth reduce saturated fats they advise but fail to mention the problems of trans fatty acids diet drinks containing neurotoxic aspartame are fine according to the writers this book is a good example of that old saying a little knowledge is a dangerous thing from sally fallon at westonaprice org 
hard to grasp i love to read christian fiction but this was a bit disapointing for the first time i actually wished that the main character jessica would just go away i mean i actually wanted to throw this book out a window a couple of times i didn t even bother to finish it and i don t think i would call this a christian faith based book in fact it said in very broad terms that all you need to do is go to church and pray and everything will work out in the end not a single mention of the plan of salvation which christian faith is based on 
i put on weight everyone s body is different my weakness was always bread therefore it s been over months i ve cut down on bread therefore when i had gone on this diet i actually put on some weight and realized that i don t miss the getting tired eating so much bread im sure it ll work for some but wasn t right for me 
oh god save us from him not again another get quotbrokequot real fast from the guy who got sued out of dozens of states and lost how many millions then filed bankruptcy too and you re gonna take his advise your not really are you are we that blind anyone who has lasted on wall street wouldn t even waste their time with one single thing he has to offer not one ! that s why they have lasted and he got sued just before his bankruptcy you have absolutely gotta be kidding me why do you think he got sued so many times and in so many different places he gave extremely dangerous and lethal advise like quotgo on margin quot and double your winnings great advise there pal wade cook gives the highest risk strategy advise that has the most disasterous consequences look at his track record ask anyone who listened and how much did the majority loose just that from his advice formulas now he is saying red amp green light what how why based on what a gut feeling what a dumb tactic why don t floor traders use his advice do money managers do credible people like the stock doctors hell no not even close you must be a second generation of greater ignorance than the last batch of them it s your money at the hands of someone who got sued filed for bankruptcy and lost millions in recent years wow what next what next danger get ready for the next wave of it 
the perfect title for this bit of self indulgent madness if one reads this they might do it with one of those foam collars about their necks that people use for whiplash because that is precisely how you will feel when you finish this work it s not bad enough the writer gets so many facts wrong out of order or does about faces on her own statement it s a marathon of wrong she actually and consistently contradicts herself ! one can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes take this as total fiction and you might enjoy it if you are looking for a feel for the period look elsewhere save your money and the headache ! to see a writer do so much research and get it all so wrong jumping around in chronological order with the consistency of a ping pong ball had to be a fine madness i don t think someone could deliberately set out to get something so wrong and do half a thorough job as murray did 
preachy and whiny while this book brought up some very good issues about how terrible overweight people are treated i found it preachy and many times got irritated with lara s whining i can understand that she s feeling sorry for herself because she used to be a beauty queen and now she s one hundred pounds overweight but i don t want to read that same thing a zillion times right up to the end of the book it made me lose sympathy for lara and by the end of the book i thought she was a stuck up brat i also had difficulty with her disease axell crowne syndrome it isn t real the author made it up and because of this disease lara felt superior to other overweight people because gaining weight wasn t her fault stuck up brat strikes again to top it off she gets mad at other people for assuming she was overweight from eating too much yet she assumed that exact thing with other overweight people how does she know the person she s looking down on isn t also suffering from axell crowne syndrome it s hard to relate to a hypocrite especially one who never seems to learn her lesson and grow from it i didn t like other messages in the book either such as suzanne s gorgeous boyfriend tristan hating that suzanne is overweight if the point of the book is to say not everyone can be thin and that s okay then why doesn t tristan love suzanne for who she is regardless of her weight anyway i could list all the things i didn t like about this book but it would take too long and i ve got other things i d rather do 
flopping like new coke while i agree in principle that a citation book should be readable and easy to use i find alwd to be decidedly useless in the real practice of law although forced to purchase the book as a l i have to meet an attorney judge or legal scholar that uses it or would like it to replace the bluebook in fact during a firm interview the attorney and i joked that we would like to start an anti alwd club to prevent ls from being tricked into preferring alwd over bluebook sorry alwd 
miss julia getting senile wow for a series which started off with a strong independent older female character miss julia has really really let herself go i knew it would be the kiss of death for julia to get married this time to too good to be true sam murdoch and i m sad to say i was right miss julia s problems in this book are all in her head her silly dithering about her marriage her jealous obsession over sam and other women and her silly worrying about whether she is married or not are so unlike the practical sensible widow i have to sigh im sorry to say it but if miss ross is to revitalize the series she d need to do something drastic such as a dump sam sorry never liked the character miss julia needs a bad boy not a saint b do something about the mr pickens situation c and get something real for miss julia to worry about rather than herself when i saw the title of this book i thought miss julia might be getting herself a new hobby unfortunately the title is misleading might be worth picking up at the library but definitely the worst in the series i was so disappointed 
this book has a special place in my heart this is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention keep you enthralled and refuse to let you stop reading i read this book and literally did not sleep one night because i was too busy trying to finish the book but what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is but it s because how good everything is until the very end that s right the incredible cop out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel this is deus ex machina in its finest form this is unexcusable in my opinion i just don t get it i just don t understand how one can seemingly work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages i gave it two stars as opposed to one for fooling everyone into reading through this book this is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
not a good book for first course in fluid mechanics i was a part time instructor over the summer at a certain university in midwest and found this book extremely difficult to teach from though the equations are correct and elegant but author makes huge leaps from the mathematical vector equations in theory to simplified equations in an inconsistent manner this makes instructors life hard as he has to fill in missing steps for many solved problems in the book after reviewing all the undergrad textbooks on fluid mechanics i would recommend people to use introduction to fluid mechanics by fox and mcdonald this book can be easily read and followed by the student while leaving instructor like myself for more time to elaborate on theory in detail 
made me feel icky i like mns a lot i like the things he says in interviews i like his movies i don t think they are perfect but they speak to me this book while an interesting and easy read is not fun i can t imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it he hasn t really publicly commented on it other than to say the author had his full support i don t know it just seemed a weird portrait of someone it seemed over dramatic and vanity fair article esque or like confessions of a shopaholic ew i don t know what mns is really like or if bamberger interpreted things accurately i just try to remember that everyone perceives situations differently 
actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go i was hoping the book would be good most reviews are however the topics are not really covered at all more introduced it was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing they openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english just as well long rambling thaughts that don t form conclusions not what i wanted or needed it actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go 
inadequate i acquired this book as a referesher subsequent to completing my mba program it is a suprising disappointment and i do not believe it is an mba in a box by any stretch of the imagination i am somewhat reluctant and uncomfortable to speak negatively about any book i have read and i have read plenty of books and review a fraction of them on amazon com nevertheless i have a sense of obligation to tell people that this book will most likely not provide them the information they are perhaps looking for in terms of mba material to try to be perhaps fair i am going to highlight some important aspects in this book innovationthe concept from clayton m christensen s the innovator s dilemma that companies fail not because managers are dumb but because the system doesn t allow them to succeed is very important as it touches on empowerment organizational learning and team building and learning strategyyes i agree that strategic thinking involves intuition and creativity i am very happy that the balanced scorecard was covered in this book which is an excellent tool for organizations to measure performance managementencourage entrepreneurial behavior and thinking ensure your team is actually empowered to make decisions take action otherwise how can you possibly encourage entrepreneurial behavior and thinking in an organization human resources the importance of retaining and motivating the knowledge worker is covered which is a concept from peter drucker organizations must appreciate recognize and understand a knowledge worker s extensive knowledge further an organization must also provide opportunities for the knowledge worker to expand her his knowledge thereby adding value for the organization marketingi enjoyed reading about customer relationships management crp allowing the customer to frame and shape the relationship between the organization and her himselfconclusionas i mentioned this book did not meet my expectations and was somewhat disappointing i think the title is not appropriate and perhaps even misleading nevertheless if you want to obtain some highlights on certain subjects and prominent business personalities this book can be useful 
a painful and slow read this book reads like a graduate thesis it manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length but i recommend not finding out for yourself spend your money elsewhere 
what the i grew up with this story what happened somewhere in this grossly underproduced version they forgot that even in a kids story you need talented actors kids know when someone sounds wooden and unskilled and you can t pawn something as poorly done as this off on them they re smarter than that ! i could ve done a better job in my garage under the bridge lived a troll come on 
as authentic as a daytime soap opera i d heard the buzz both pro and con and thought i d take an independent read i was dismayed with this book james frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had one of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the truth so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him lies are what enable slips and enabling and denial and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure recovery is nearly impossible without honesty so can we look at this man s memoir and expect it to offer anything of value it s poorly constructed repetitive and narcisitic even if oprah hadn t exposed him the writing takes the tone of whoppers like frey s account of the drug house visit in which he rescues lilly other reviewers and smoking gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one and i can t improve on that suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life the same way a million little pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction a real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result i was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept like a joke of some kind i m not laughing 
sloppy i think better information can be gained by reading wikipedia than can be gained from reading this book as a metalhead i have the feeling that moynihan is an outsider writing about something he doesn t really understand maybe he is just catering to people who aren t familiar with metal but it s to the detriment of the book s accuracy i think he misses the point of some bands he also does a very quick and sloppy job of some sections which is annoying for example he states the misfits mutated into samhain by the band had changed names again to simply danzig which is totally false the misfits ended when glenn danzig left the band and formed samhain which later became danzig furthermore the misfits reunited without danzig in meaning that danzig and the misfits existed as separate bands at the time of the book s printing it s one of many sloppy errors hasty summaries in the book that make it frustrating to read if you are a fan or already know the story this book will be nothing but agravation if you are an outsider to the genre it should be an interesting read 
does this book help you make money no i have read just about every popular book on horserace betting and the acid test is does it help beat the races the name of the game in betting thorougbreds is data mining and processing which can only be done with software on a computer i have software that allowed me to test some of the factors cited in this and other popular books the bottom line yes you get a high percentage of winners but unfortunately these horses are overbet indicating that the info in this and other popular books is well known and used by the betting public to beat the horses you have to think outside the box so in conclusion don t waste your time reading this book 
good information but watch out for the bad i found most of the information ok but there was stuff in this book that made me wary prozac for pms hysterectomy good idea for fibroids who would seriously consider these options natural progesterone and studies on it dismissed in one paragraph these things left me rather unimpressed i would not rely on this book as my main source of information 
worst vampire book of story had potential but the heroine was totally unlikeable she continually made what were supposed to be smart and sassy comments but came across as snarky and foul mouthed the hero was terminally patient and nice why anyone would want to spend minutes with this woman nevermind eternity baffled me 
if i had wanted a romance novel i would ve looked in that part of the book store i first picked up on the anita blake series a little over a year ago i was absolutely enthralled not only was the main character witty intelligent and kick butt but there was a memorable set of supporting characters to see her through who can forget zerbrowski s antics even in the worst of times or the cold hearted killing of everyone s favorite bounty hunter after reading my share of the books and floating around to some of the other reviews here on amazon i am left wondering the same thing many of the other fans are what happened i just finished narcissus in chains normally when i finish a book i m left with a sense of fulfillment like i ve accomplished something unfortunately that was not the case i ve always found this series to capture me from the get go but trying to convince myself to read this one was hard not only was the plot rather weak but anita seemed to keep on debating the same situations over and over jean claude richard micah and even asher seem to plague her thoughts and although she will do anything to save a member of her pard or anyone else for that matter her focus always seemed to drift back to the boys and did anyone else notice the repetitiveness in the writing hamilton used the exact same wording for certain feelings or actions throughout the book unlike the earlier part of the series the writing in narcissus in chains is less imaginative and less memorable on top of it all come the end of the book we have this bad guy who i can t even remember where he came from in the first place my favorite part of the books has always been anita s police work i am honestly ten times more interested in her career than i am in her love life i miss having a tight intense plot that flows instead of drifting around like some kid with a short attention span and as pointed out in the book the charming anita blake we used to know and love really has become a monster a literary disaster of a monster although the reviews for cerulean sins are probably just as grim as the reviews for narcissus in chains i plan to go ahead and continue the series i can t give up on something that has such great potential and from the sound of it this next one has a more recognizable plot i can only hope unfortunately i believe that obsidian butterfly was probably the last of one of the best series and best characters ever created 
disappointing i read a lot of thrillers and this debut by casey moreton disappointed me as a previous reviewer pointed out there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful it is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers a corrupt president a reformed hit man a father looking for his lost daughter etc the most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character the author keeps jumping around from person to person changing narrative perspectives i therefore had no idea who the hero of this novel was supposed to be to me it s hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character and there really isn t one in this novel if you like suspense novels i recommend reading harlan coben or cj box instead 
not cute at all stars if there were such a thingugly boring squares oops i mean patternscheesy hickish dialectgreat ! for middle americaan example of bloggers jumping on the knitting book bandwagon feeding the sheep along the wayreally can t for the life of me figure out the hype behind this book 
least interesting and helpful book on the subject thus far i have read many books on mpd did and this one is the least interesting and helpful thus far i do not wish to take any personal jabs at the author however mpd did is obviously not her only disorder by the time you get to the end of the book and read about more post healing tragedies and abuse one gets the feeling that the author thrives on such drama when people write autobigraphies they take the reader into their world i do not wish to be dragged into this author s world it s not about happy endings but it is about wanting to read truly good books written by truly healthy people who have truly overcome 
this is a horror story i have read a few peter straub novels of which ghost story was one of the finest i have ever come across but this piece of compacted toilet paper is total rubish his detailed descriptions of the town is done so well that i could probably go there and walk through that town with my eyes closed but this does not make for a good story the third time this book hit me in the face after falling asleep i resolved to leave it on the shelf for a year well it is now two years later and it still bores me to death 
man fish book my friend told me this book is incredible but i found it a little far fetched personally why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up warning spoiler alert in the end of the book it would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters me i think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far two stars for your book ernest ! one star for each caracter you put in the story even including fish youre rating is as good as melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
why is there no zero star option i remember reading this book when i was a teen at a time when the church i was attending was very much into end time prophecies embarrassing as it is to admit it i fell for it hook line and sinker blush yet came and went nothing horrible happened and i forgot about this steaming pile of dog manure it didn t matter though because there were and still are plenty of other prophetic books to fill the gap and keep christians pants wetting scared i am no longer a christian and in retrospect i wonder why we were all so scared by hal lindsey s nonsense after all the end times meant that sweet jesus was coming and we d all be raptured away into the clouds to avoid all the tribulation and terror ! i think there was the secret fear that we wouldn t be good enough and our allegedly loving savior would leave us behind on a whim at any rate i wouldn t recommend hal s book for any purpose other than fireplace kindling or maybe as a good laugh at the gullibility of desperate and easily frightened people he is no different than any other self proclaimed prophet of god picking whatever scriptures he can to back up his crazy ideas and attempting to use math to count the number of days weeks and generations since this or that event if you must buy it look for it at thrift stores where you can pick it up for cents save your ten bucks for something more worthwhile like a couple of spider man comics or something 
tiresome recap of an exhaustive list of life events president clinton s autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries it frequently appears as though the brief daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added it does provide an extensive recap of president clinton s life events so if that s of interest you may want to check it out 
definitions politically incorrect apparently means bigoted racist sexist classist and freakin proud of it woman these guides are a scary scary joke written by angry bigots to make open minded people angry and to help justify their own prejudices and inablity to let go of the good old days when it was considered fitting when a woman got slapped for mouthing off what a disgusting view of the world 
a little disappointing i bought this book because david sedaris recommended it at the last reading i attended the stories are all on the dark side and they do not appeal to me admittedly i prefer something much more light hearted so others may love this book 
crummy i don t know why i do it to myself anymore goodkind brought a real gem into the world of fantasy novels when he wrote wizard s first rule unfortunately as with most novel series i have read it was all downhill from there the most common complaint in the reviews i have read seems to be that goodkind s novels have become thinly veiled philosophy essays and i concur with that i d also add that the story is predictable the characters behave foolishly and how can i put this in a way that won t spoil the ending things just seem to work out a little too conveniently after this one i don t think i ll continue to torture myself with any more of goodkind s work i no longer care what happens to richard and kahlan and as much as i liked them in the first book that s pretty depressing 
politically independent i bought this book after seeing mr florida talk on cspan he does have some interesting things to say about creativity but i found it very difficult to finish mr florida claims to be politically independent but he doesn t even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual bush bashing one see s only in the extreme left and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same including the ridiculous pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber bit if he s politically independent then i m the king of siam and his solution right out of the leftists playbook we have to spend more lots more way more than we ever have several orders of magnitude more on education culture and the arts anyone interested in buying a used book only read once 
be ready to fall asleep i have previously enjoyed all of suzanne brockmann s books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction i have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances i really hate it what a yawner and i wouldn t recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated 
what amazing insights from a guy who talks to god snicker sorry for the sarcasm but i can t help thinking just how uninspired this book is imagine a counter to this book this book would promote hate dishonesty immorality ignorance ingratitude you get the picture this mormon leader s great contribution to world is to say we should be honest now that was profound ! sadly gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world as an avowed atheist i encourage everyone to be honest moral learned and all the things gordo promotes in this book there is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with mormonism but this book is written for children and sheep promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the new england patriots or comparing a janice kapp perry vapid song to bach s mass in b minor mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the st century this book should confine itself to the children s section or to the local deseret book store 
one sided nationalistic story avoid if you care about history here s the news less than half the forces on the allied side on d day were from the u s would you guess that from reading ambrose s book nope the vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the u s experience it seems ambrose thinks the british canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers its just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it d day to perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial worse it s offensive to the memories of all those who fought and died for democracy the american sacrifice was real and doesn t need this sort of thing to keep its memory green robin neillands and john keegan have both written much better fairer accounts if ambrose had called the book the american contribution to d day no one could have complained as it is it has no claim to our serious consideration as history 
spoilers if that s even possible this will be short and sweet i read this about three years ago this book had potential but sucked forget the fact that there is a graphic and brutal rape and murder of a kid i can deal with that what i can t deal with is the fact that this girl goes to heaven watches down on everyone she knew and basically the one last thing she does is inhabit the body of another girl and f the he out of some guy she thinks is hot yeah tell me on what effing planet is a child raped and murdered and her one wish is to come back to earth for a few hours and do some guy anyway yeah at that point the book became a huge chore for me to finish lame to the extreme 
perfectly useless this book deals with older palm operating systems so old in fact that my year old t was way beyond it it has a copyright from about if this was in a real bookstore i owuld have been able to see this fact and avoid this out ofdate product perhaps my worse amazon experiece to date

nothin much here this is like the other cambridge companions it is not a reference work is not thorough is not authoritative nor objective this is a collection of essays tending toward the highly speculative each around pages in length they range from the silly to the ok and none are very impressive the cambridge companion series is misleadingly titled they cater to narrow interests not to the general public students who need a basic understanding of nietzsche before they start delving into special topics will find almost no assistance here most of the material is of the professorial specialized not generallyinteresting variety

soul by soul by walter johnson the principle question that arises from a reading of quotsoul by soul quot by walter johnson is why was this book written it is touted as history yet not only does it lack any original historical material it also lacks any discernable historical facts rather than history quotsoul by soul quot seems to be a mean spirited emotional tract designed to promote two fundamental ideas that white people living in the antebellum south were universally loathsome brutish and cruel and that black people living in the antebellum south were universally noble good and abused to support his views professor johnson strings together a loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings his personal contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche of the book s long deceased characters and divine their true but unspoken motives and thoughts quite a feat for any historian ! one loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using their quotprobing fingers quot in this book fortunately in between probes the reader can be shocked by the quotkilling fields of the lower south quot the quothistorical sexualization of black bodies quot the quotslaveholders inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves quot and the quotbrutish perogatives of whiteness quot this is heavy hate filled stuff worthy of a tv mini series but it is out of place in a supposedly serious history text i live in a former slave quarter in new orleans in the antebellum period this building and its resident slaves were interestingly enough owned by a free black who was financially ruined in by the emancipation proclamation as an amateur historian i would have thought that a book about the new orleans slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these markets what were their addresses what percentage of their customers were black what percentage were white how many slaves did the typical new orleans household have how were they fed and clothed what were their working hours these are basic questions that should have been addressed but instead the reader is given an emotionally charged repetitious boring rehash of tired previously published material in short this book for the most part reads like a rambling overly long sermon anyone seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the quotslave narratives quot compiled by the federal writers project quottime on the cross quot by robert fogel and stanley engerman and quotthe slave trade quot by hugh thomas the first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves performed by the w pa in the s the latter two works contain original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery not the emotions 
did you all actually read it first off i am an avid reader and love a long challenging read however this novel is one of the worst i have ever read ! it is long boring and has absolutely no plot i purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews although from the looks of most of them here i personally suspect that many of those who raved never actually read the book 
this book is trash this book is the biggest piece of literary trash i have seen in a long time it is a collection of peace mongering propaganda that seems to take issue with political reality as much as the author does in her own life the agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author the poems are rather sophomoric at best and are poorly written most of them make no sense you would have to be inside ms walker s head to comprehend her contorted style it appears that ms walker should re enroll in a college level poetry class this book is trash don t waste your money on this piece of junk i took my copy back after hours

skeeter is jar jar binks rabbit redux is by far the worst of the rabbit series and for one reason the character of skeeter never have i read a book where the author allowed such an annoying character to hijack his story what jar jar binks that annoying character who never shut up was to star wars the phantom menace skeeter was to redux after a while of putting up with the boring and endless rantings of this character i began skipping pages i hate doing that but i had no choice i found that it didn t matter much anyway nothing skeeter said brought anything to this story nor does it to the following two rabbit booksthe book was good overall but why did updike have to devote so much of the story to skeeter and his mindless rantings 
not even for the airplane if you enjoy a good tightly plotted thriller read something else this flabby clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the all of the characters are two dimensional and if you don t figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious 
a superficially selective journalistic survey of the church written by the same author as cults new religions movements and your family as well as defending the faith a beginner s guide to cults and new religions gives a sense where the author is headed with this prodigious history of the church although not an actual history of mormonism but more of a superficially selective journalistic survey of the church its people dealings and influences the book offers the reader an enormous panoramic overview at the entire year span of its existence yes the volume is anti mormon it is negative and has no balanced view or viewpoint abanes uses enflamed and sensualistic language from the start and propagates the same misjudgments as previous anti mormon writers confusing the action of members with the doctrines of the institution using enflamed and unreliable anti mormon sources as well as regurgitating old anti mormon arguments that have been dealt with in scholarly journals and balanced histories yes he mostly uses only secondary materials and relies on the tanner s as an authoritative source and yes the author has no clue what historical perspective is but one must give the author his due for the broad scope of the work he not only covers all the standard anti mormon fare the danites blood atonement polygamy money digging etc but current subjects as well including the osmond s steve benson the olympics paul dunn thomas ferguson and racism i enjoyed the author s journalistic and creative approach to chapter and sub chapter headings as well ie bloody brigham big trouble in little missouri pride and prejudice and thinking is a sin i like that abanes uses the internet and listed url s for reference and resource i liked his use of charts first vision book of mormon failed prophecies and even though this book would not be published by an academic press or a large well known publisher it was published by a distinguished independent publisher that was since bought by the avalon publishing group although the work cannot be recommend as a studious publication or an important work on mormonism the author does show that the church as an institution does have a long way to go in answering questions about its past its official vs its actual history and currently about its political activities treatment of its academic members versus the coddling it shows towards its more notable members including general authorities as well as its suppression of its own history that includes the closing off of its records and library the volume has pages of text five appendices one containing a helpful glossary of mormon terms pages of notes a small bibliography and a page index

imitation bat abandoning the reinterpretation of the initial epoch of batman like the previous writings of the long halloween and dark victory hush instead is a tale set in the modern era the plot concerns the arrival of a new villain and the supposed control of the insane criminal base of gotham city the dark knight must work to end the transgression that seems to be rapidly spiralling out of control the story begins as a simple kidnap and ransom story that appears to be only a fraction of a greater crisis playing out behind the scenes eventually turning into a mass profusion of ideas and set pieces without proper relevance or connection the denouement is inauthentic where it s fragmented and composed of distracting slack subplots largely unnecessary to the thematic undercurrent rather than follow through on the normal writing design of problem reaction resolution the plot advancement has batman continually reacting a villain is introduced generating the requisite fight scene that unfolds over an entire issue this technique carries on until all the a list villains appear it keeps the readers mind disengaged from the mystery with its barrage of moments that provoke the certain predictable appeal from the readership hush ultimately becomes out of control throughout the plot development in its intent on being an epic all defining book with its features of shocking moments and revelations that trick has an overall numbing experience as the writing never recovers from the numerous blows to its credibility from the revisionist writing method the obvious mystery at the core is a simple pretext to affix a lingering indulgent plot to the city s criminal element ensuring that numerous revered characters are on display the narrative never addresses or justifies the illogical unexplained behavior of the characters rather than constructing a contemplative mystery worthy of batman s abilities the character is rewritten without the strong awareness and detective instinct his character arc severely undermined as a result overall hush never feels like a sincere attempt at storytelling where it differs from halloween and victory timewise the revisionism and borrowed themes that characterized past writings are conspicuously promoted throughout the work with the same undisciplined methods the book labors beneath redundancy and re examination of ideas and passages already demonstrated following the similar formula of those aforementioned works it lacks inner consistency of the recent treatment of the world and it fails to reconfigure its limited concept to place well within the current framework of the character it doesn t attempt to explore the limits of the medium but one entirely content to reside within its past conventions barely acceptable as an entertaining diversion 
the unorthodox bible to building fat apparently the authors don t know the strength of the word bible if this book is a bible then i hope that i ll never find it in the drawer of a hotel bed side table absurd information about nutrition someone should tell the people from gold s to start from the beginning instead of writing books for their already huge friends if you re a beginner don t join the gold s religion find another bible that s realist 
not even one star what a waste the title of this book should not be allowed to use the term accounting there are a plethora of very inexpensive computerized accounting systems for small businesses i purchased simply accounting from best software and was looking for a text to supplement my knowledge to assist me in implementing the system this mechanized accounting system from best works beautifully and then i discover this accounting book uses singleentry accounting which in my opinion doesn t even exist except in the author s mind or can t be defined that i am aware of this book comprises a system of manual forms to manage your business and as i said before should not be able to use accounting in its title at least label it something like use manual forms to manage your business 
plowing through i never made it past the first three chapters even though we were assigned to read the whole thing the long drawn out epistomology the study of knowledge and boring examples sucked the life out of little red ridinghood was so hard to get through i probably never made it to the good stuff definitely not fun exciting reading for the average person the only interesting thing to me was the constant use of the phrase the proof is in the pudding but then again i m not a scholar

big on inspiration for boys short on facts bell s book has been an inspiration to several generations of mathematicians encouraging them to pursue the creative discipline of mathematics for that he has done a great service to mathematics unfortunately that is the only good thing i can say about this book e t bell was a respected caltech mathematician who dabbled in writing books about mathematical history he was a great writer with style which has led many to believe he was also an eminent scholar of history of mathematics nothing could be farther from the truth bell manages to perpetrate fiction in almost every other line mangling known facts making unwarranted judgments and characterizations of personalities and motives whatever he needs to do to construct an entertaining story he does his name is universally cursed by historians of mathematicians making up stuff for a good story might not ordinarily be bad after all a lot of people do it and certainly encouraging youngsters to study mathematics is not a bad goal but there are several ways in which this book is insidious one is the negative potrayal of women mathematicians as the astute reader will have noted the title is men of mathematics on my paperpack edition the word men is even set off by a different color than the rest of the title the forgiving reader may be willing to forgive this after all the book was written in less politically correct times and certainly most of the famous and well documented mathematicians are men gauss a man euler a man also etc on the other hand there are notable examples of great mathematicians who happened to be women emmy noether and sonja kowalewski for example women who are mentioned in bell s book but are either paid little attention to or treated rather badly in a way that clearly highlights bell s own prejudices some readers will be struck by sentences like sonjas sex had got the better of her ambitions and she had been living happily with her husband rather than list more examples let me stop by adding that this kind of sentence is typical of bell and doesn t stand out much what is perhaps the most revealing is that chapter master and pupil which is about weierstrass and kowalewski spends undue amount of time discussing kowalewski s sexual attributes and their effect on her mathematical colleagues and teachers and little explaining her contributions to mathematics bell also shows prejudice when he explains that the dispute between cantor and kronecker was due in part because rightly or wrongly cantor blamed kronecker for his failure to obtain the coveted position at berlin the aggressive clannishness of jews has often been remarked sometimes as an argument against employing them in academic work but it has not been so generally observed that there is no more vicious academic hatred than that of one jew for another when they disagree on purely scientific matters or when one is jealous or afraid of another gentiles either laugh these hatreds off or go at them in an efficient underhand way which often enables them to accomplish their spiteful ends under the guise of sincere friendship when two intellectual jews fall out they disagree all over throw reserve to the dogs and do everything in their power to cut one anothers throats or stab one another in the back this quote was later modified i think it might have been after bell s death to be about styles of academic infighting rather than a commentary about jews and gentiles bell typically exaggerates or just plain makes things up in order to make for a better story but i think such a false potrayal of mathematicians cannot be good the chapter on galois the most famous part of the book is replete with historical errors and omissions including rearranging order of events leaving out the less savory aspects of galois personality and basically saying galois invented galois theory the night before the duel even though parts of his work were published and known by that time to other mathematicians bell consistently paints galois as misunderstood and his older mathematical colleagues as buffoons this is a seductive thought to some but the reality is that great mathematical ideas don t have to be suppressed in order to be dormant truly great ideas can sometimes take years to sink in not a romantic viewpoint perhaps but i think galois greatness is enhanced not diminished by this realization of course galois s inability unwillingness to better communicate his ideas didn t help ! this book is certainly inspirational for some but especially for today s audience i think it ll be glaringly biased and i doubt very inspiring for young girls in particular the worst thing you can do is give this book to your child to read there have been many books since then that are more accurate and less prejudiced in flavor 
disappointing i picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title but what i found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development the ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved i was disappointed 
missing book today i have not received this book yet could you inform me when this book would be delivered please 
unsatisfying and disappointing on many levels reading this book is like trying to hold onto a handful of water the characters are paper thin unbelievable and unlikeable the multiple plot threads are unconvincing tangled and ultimately go nowhere nearly every bit of action that might have been interesting happens at a remove read wjw s books aristoi hardwired voice of the whirlwind days of atonement but stay away from this one and its prequel 
simplistic and selective i was a bit surprised that this book essay received such high marks from so many reviews for all its purported brevity it is remarkably repetitive and filled with extraneous tangents its pages with afterword could easily be trimmed down to pages without losing much content kagans major claims are the following europeans and americans have divergent perspectives regarding international relations and foreign policy britons tend to find themselves in the middle these different perspectives are relatively recent and have not been the norm over the long span of history america has always seen itself and esp in the last years as a pro active agent of liberal democracy in the world the united nations has no practical legitimacy the precepts of national sovereignty and of moral intervention are mutually conflicting barring an unforeseen disaster the u s will continue to dominate world affairs as it sees fit unless europe finally comes on board with the u s the net power of liberal democracies in the world may decrease enough to threaten world security it does not take a tremendously perceptive reader to gather that this essay is basically an apologia for the iraq war as such evidence and observations are gathered very selectively and a handful of points are drilled at repeatedly one of these is the fact that the kosovo intervention by europeans was illegal in that it violated international law kagan argues in essence if europe didn t mind invading kosovo illegally in why should they care about iraq in this is a legitimate question to ask but kagan s analysis is superficial as it must be to maintain his position today in november the differences are all too clear kosovo was an intervention into genocide and ethnic cleansing based on human rights and humanitarian reasons iraq was an intervention into a failing dictatorship taken to satisfy grandiose foreign policy aspirations and provide lucrative contracts for corporations and based on fraudulent evidence and countless lies the issue of the conflict between international law and moral intervention is a legitimate one but kosovo iraq is a false comparison there are other glaring omissions and or howlers that speak volumes the enormous costs of the advocated preventive foreign policy the mounting defecits and debt are barely mentioned in passing once or twice kagan even states at one point that economically america can go alone in the reconstruction of places like iraq if it absolutely has to five decades ago after all it reconstructed europe and japan with its own funds yes but not while the government was run by a cabal cutting taxes and spending more than anyone previously henry kissinger is described as a quintessential realist kagan even states americans do not argue even to themselves that their actions may be justified by raison d etat i wonder what country he s living in oh that s right he lives in belgium now kagan set himself up for a difficult task defending the iraq war by deflecting attention from the facts of that sham and resorting to political rhetoric and philosophising no wonder it comes across as a badly written college term paper his faith in american moral superiority is unquestioned and this is where his thesis falls apart if might is right and you have the might you assume you do right but what if you re wrong 
a little knowledge is a dangerous thing this is one of the three books i commented for a book review assignment of a korean history class taught by a very very renowned professor on korean history i got an a a for the review my professor especially argeed with my comments for triplett s book as i disagree with the previous reviews on amazon which is the reason i chose to read this book a big waste of time sadly i want to leave my review here for future reader s reference rogue state how a nuclear north korea threatens america although written by a former chief republican counsel to the senate foreign relations committee william triplett ii is overall a disappointing book triplett accuses north korea of proliferating weapons supporting terrorism producing and selling drugs abusing human rights and kidnapping females to be sex slaves although triplett provides many detailed allegations and facts he does not give credible and unbiased sources for many of his allegations which greatly weakens his claim moreover he presents north korea as the most dangerous state in the world he also accuses china for planning behind it and supporting it militarily economically and politically for almost sixty years with a hidden intension to use north korea as a borrowed knife to kill other people p contrary to what is suggested in his title triplett does not spend much analysis on north korea nuclear crisis itself but just the potential outcomes if everything goes as he argues he also fails to give any constructive recommendations only predicting that issues on north korea and nuclear weapons in particular will not progress unless the u s define the issue not as north korea but as communist china and north korea p yet america already tried to involve china in solving the north korea nuclear crisis triplett borrows the phrase killing with a borrowed knife from a chinese military classic the stratagems he presents this strategy as if it is a secret doctrine of the chinese people according to him it means to use covertly another country to annihilate your enemy p however he apparently does not fully understand the meaning of this phrase triplett says that to make the stratagem work it has to be disguised by keeping your opponent from learning vital information denial and misleading him about your true intentions deception he therefore argues that china and north korea have been adopting a strategy of denial and deception trying to hide their malicious aggressive intensions p however his interpretation of this stratagem is completely wrong it is true that to make this stratagem work one has to disguise his intentions yet the disguise is not only for the opponent but more importantly for the one you borrowed the knife from the point of this strategy is to deceive someone make him fight against your opponent and let that person bear all the costs that china and north korea indeed made some secret agreement as triplett suggests goes directly against this strategy therefore triplett cannot reach the point that china and north korea have been using denial and deception by just claiming that they try to kill with a borrowed knife triplett goes on to spend about a quarter of the book on a history of the role stalin s soviet union and mao s red china played during the korean war to demonstrate their close connection with north korea triplett gives a list of records of the soviet s and china s involvement in north korea p without providing any source for his allegation this puts the reader in doubts about the credibility and impartiality of his claim for example triplett writes that moscow and beijing helped kim start the korean war beijing intervened to block a united national victory in the war p however the question of who started the korean war north or south is still debatable in a more impartial view bruce cumings thinks that it is wrong to ask who started the war since both north and south korea were at fault cumings korea s place in the sun p cumings argue that the united nation s decision to enter the war against north korea was solely based on american and south korean sources and was likely to be biased cumings p thus accusing china of haveing blocked a united nation s victory without providing enough background information could mislead the reader in another allegation triplett claims that communist china helped pyongyang to start the korean war p this accusation is apparently false at that time china saw conquering taiwan as its priority and did not want the korean war to divert its energy it did not support the idea of the korean war and did not help north korea in the war until very late actually too late in a military strategy perspective to demonstrate that the soviet union china and north korea produced a series of decisions that initiated a reign of terror over millions of people in the far east and established the framework for east asia today triplett claims that stalin mao and kim decided in a communist summit in late to let kim conquer south korea mao conquer tibet and taiwan and ho chi minh conquer indochina and attack the japanese communist party p however triplett again fails to credit any source for this important decision what s more as we can see after more than half a century none of these goals materialized except for china s takeover of tibet many of these aims were even never attempted let alone attempted but failed therefore even if stalin mao and kim did make a secret agreement with only one goal achieved i wonder whether china and north korea indeed have the ability to initiate a reign of terror and put billions of lives in danger as triplett claims triplett claims that china supports north korea and is to blame for making north korea so dangerous however triplett fails to make it clear what china s intension and incentive to support north korea is this is crucial to how the non communist world should respond china may not have malicious aims to support north korea it could have done it partly because of mao s romanticism to help his communist friend in the s and once the support started it would be hard to stop china might also support north korea to increase its own influence in international politics but without the aim to use north korea to dominate the world such intensions are perfectly justified the u s is also supporting various countries and regions around the world in order to have a stake in regional politics such as taiwan japan and israeli another possibility may be that china sees the trend in north korea towards terrorism and instability fearing a neighboring country getting into trouble and the spillover that would ensue china may be trying to prevent a social and political crisis in north korea by providing support triplett fail to analyze any these possibilities in fact china should be one of the countries that want to see north korea to become a terrorist state the least unless it can fully control kim jong il which triplett fails to prove either triplett provides another piece of evidence against his accusation of china s involvement himself to prove the danger of north korea he says that it turned to income from producing and selling drugs after china cut its support to fund its own economic development regardless of the amount of support china has provided north korea how could we assume that china is the evil planner behind north korea right now after china already cut its support the weakest point of triplett s book in my point of view is that after making so many unaccredited and rather controversial claims he fails to go anywhere significant in his analysis he does not really examine the implications of the nuclear tensions after he argues that there is no simple military solution to a nuclear north korea to solve the north korean problem the u s has to define the problem not as north korea but as communist china and north korea p although triplett claims that the bush administration are blind to the role of communist china what i have shown is that china has always played an important role in negotiating with the north koreans and it is not the case that the u s has not tried to make china influence north korea more if china has tried all it can triplett s conclusion does not help the problem if china tried to hide its influence on north korea then what can america do even if it re defines the problem if it wants china to move there will be a price to pay this is a known rule of the game of international politics triplett s suggestion is incomplete without a recommendation on how to employ china into the negotiation at a reasonable price to be sure triplett does provide many examples and tries to prove the connection between china and north korea from an historical perspective however because he fails to give references for many important examples the creditability and impartiality of his book and consequently his conclusion is in question readers with more knowledge about korean history could easily give alternative explanations of his examples that do not lead to his conclusion besides his conclusion does not contribute much to the situation right now given triplett s role in the u s government this book is important and valuable in another sense it more or less indicates one u s governmental official s perspective on north korea a dangerously prejudiced perspecitve another minor point triplett should have done a better selection and framing of the cases for example in a list of prices the non communist world have paid for north korea triplett parallels the loss of more than americans lives in the korean war to the killing of a high school girl singing in a chorus in the same shootout that killed the south korean first lady p no matter how cruel the killing of an innocent high school girl is it is way less important and significant than the more than the causality of americans in the korean war putting these two on the same list gives rise to doubts about the author s capability 
from standup to standup probably a great resource if you re interested in being a standup comic other than that there s not really that much in this book i found useful or interesting a lot of name dropping though ! apparently every comedian throughout the history of standup has taken one of judy carter s classes 
rambling text no meat reading this book is like running in sand much effort is expended with little progress generalizations and qualitative rather than quantitative facts abound a chapter on crusting and scaling dermatoses provides vague descriptions and procedures if you didn t know how to interpret a skin scraping or impression smear before you read this chapter you wouldn t know after reading it either the chapters on rickettsial disease do not include the most quantitative and pivotal clinical and experimental references canine rocky mountan spotted fever for example is a fascinating unique syndrome but this text provides neither a clear clinical description nor an explanation of the pathophysiologic basis of this infection the book greatly underestimates the knowledge and skill level of the graduate veterinarian 
unsubstantiated i have only read the neon genesis evangelion section for a paper from what i ve read it seems to me that redmond makes provacative assertions that are annoyingly lacking in evidence the evangelion chapters largely consist of episode summaries the majority of which has nothing to do with his thesis that evangelion is an allegory for east asian regionalism redmond occasionally throws in generic terms such as asiazilla and east asian subjectivity to maintain a link to his thesis but his weak analysis and sparse evidence on them only confused me a book worth a glance only for its brevity and originality as there isn t much literature that closely examines anime in the scope of east asian regionalism 
sex belongs in the bedroom not in the library this book is filthy i had to take a shower after i read it why doesn t he get a job why does he have to live in france why doesn t he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers so many questions people just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say james michenier because it was banned it was banned because it s a bad book 
cliched predictable i haven t read any of the real robert ludlum before but i don t think i will be starting if this is his style the action scenes with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts are perhaps better suited to a minute movie instead of a page book the weapons catalogue padding is comical at first later frustrating the childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places we know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest perhaps most disturbing is the book s overall s style racism in which the americans are dashing multi skilled warriors for good and the russians ukrainians even germans are all ugly inhuman or quickly dead whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water tight the reader is always a step ahead of the characters as other reviews have said suspense and mystery are left absent 
unpardonable error unfortunately my copy of edition fell open to page in which the author compares forces from a piston engine to forces generated by living tissue unfortunately this type of comparison is often completely invalid particularly when the force is accompanied by zero motion in the direction of the force for example if the combustion force is replaced by a highly compressed spring and if the crank is balanced exactly at top dead center the spring will never get tired of exerting its force in contrast a human leg will get tired even though no motion occurs this is because chemical energy is consumed to exert the force even in the absence of motion unfortunately with this single unreasoned comparison that drives to the core of bicycling science the author has shot himself in the credibility foot leaving all else he has to say in question 
lousy little yoga book not expensive but not worth much either ultimately imho doing asanas in bed is a bad idea much better to do poses on a firm surface i e the floor 
only for diehard wilkie collins fans this book is definitely not another woman in white or the moonstone both wonderfully well written mysteries for those who absolutely have to read every word that collins wrote this book is recommended the plot is fairly boring and the characters fairly uninteresting overall a slow and somewhat dull read 
der ueber professor john carey is the merton professor of english literature at the university of oxford occupying one of the most prestigious chairs in the academic world today from this olympian height professor carey conducts a battle on behalf of the general public against most of the writers and thinkers of the modernist movement why can t we understand modern art and literature the answer is simple these major intellectuals both hated and feared the masses i e us and consciously isolated themselves in life and in art from the general public thus spake professor carey and why would these modern intellectuals hate us again the answer is simple because they were influenced by that evil couple of thinkers so influential around the beginning of the century nietzsche and freud nietzsche according to professor carey despised the masses and yearned for the coming of a superman to enslave the rest of mankind therefore he is responsible for fascism freud similarly made up psychological theories to explain the herd behavior of the masses make no mistake about it professor carey is for the people and against fascism totalitarianism etc etc on the other hand those of us from the masses who have actually read the books from down below find it hard to agree with professor carey s sweeping condemnation of course we lack the mountain air and bird seyeview of the merton professor but we happen to detect in this book in the all tooeasy answers given on every page a trace of what nietzsche would call ressentiment towards the intellectuals that he condemns professor carey seems to have a i hopeyourotinhell attitude and his chief method is to pick any and every quote from any and every book out of context that would prove his wonderfully brutal hypothesis in the end our professor seems to be the one out of touch with reality with paranoid delusions about the descendents of modernism taking over the contemporary world who s afraid of derrida read this book to find out one final note today the works of the modernists condemned in this book are studied by all who care about humanity in all major languages and in every corner of the world ie by the masses and as to our oxford professor who doesn t even tutor undergrads anymore 
too long this is a great book but it is just stretched way too long it starts out great and keeps the reader glued to the pages then the book starts to end the same things happen over and over again and you just think when id this book going to end personaly i think this book could have ended about pages befor it did i think the book would have had a shot at the newbery if it didn t go on as long as it di that just goes to show that you cant hve a super deduper start but then your ending just really stinks your book wont be that good you need to have a good ending and a good begining in order to have a good book 
badly written badly written book 
less credible than christian orthodoxy as a somewhat unorthodox christian i am not opposed to efforts to revisit the earliest sources of christian tradition in order to discern the original teachings of jesus and his followers it is indeed quite possible even probable that those teachings underwent transformation and development and that some of these developments eventually ran contrary to the original teachings there are books that follow this process in a way that is intellectually respectable and based on sound scholarship this book unfortunately is not one of them this book will appeal to those who despise orthodox christianity yet feel a compelling need to reinterpret christianity according to their subjective psychological needs for such people facts do not matter and any theory which radically reinterprets traditional christianity no matter how far fetched will find a ready audience for those who want views of early christianity that pay attention to the historical facts i can recommend without necessarily agreeing with the scholarly works of geza vermes raymond brown bart ehrman marcus borg n t wright and even bishop spong if you insist on ultra liberalism do not waste your money on the rubbish of the aptly named timothy freke 
brain dead main character kills story this book was simply not up to baldacci s usual quality the story goes all over the place but doesn t get anywhere until the last pages even after and even pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going i don t mind suspense but you can stay suspended only so long until it becomes boredom the main character is the worst one baldacci has ever created one minute she is crying her eyes out and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept fbi agents and police this is repeated throughout the story i would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book she makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers by the end of the book i found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid off this is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping 
unbiblical and bad writing make for one star this book is so flawed in every which way it is hard to know where to begin first of all we are living in the end times and when jesus comes that s all she wrote folks there s no seven years no christians being zapped up etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true then what s the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to and then when people zap out of thin air change your life it s ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really don t think the author s care at this point seeing how many millions they ve made printing lies my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you ll get truth and the bible is probably shorter and much better writing man not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck 
very dissapointing i was very dissapointed in this book the only good story was sherrilyn kenyon s and it was far too short i was really looking forward to this book and was extreamly dissapointed 
tedious academic compilation there were a few good nuggets of information in the varied chapters however most of the content of this book is hopelessly dry and academic seemingly written by professors and wonks for other professors and wonks i cannot raise the appraisal of culture matters above two stars yes culture most certainly matters the value sets of peoples around the world determine if they develop and thrive or collapse into mediocrity 
not interesting as a book this book would do well to advertise itself as a series of articles about topics and people related to chocolate and chocolate production but marketed as the story of chocolate it s needlessly boring the chapters are about the length of an article and don t seem to be interconnected except in subject matter the first few chapters were very interesting but around the chapter the chocolate coast i realized that these were the longest some pages of my life i would be more interested in the history and lore of chocolate rather than chapter after chapter of how he followed someone around was almost denied access to their secrets factory and then talking about the different fermentation processes and what the machines look like he may fare better to talk about wines because that s how the subject is treated and somehow it just doesn t fit he becomes haughty about the inferiority of american chocolate treating his audience as a oenophile would speak to someone who drinks wine coolers as for the writing it seems to steer wrecklessly between very dry and excessively nostalgic this book would be a winner with people interested chocolate economics how different people use difference processes and how chocolate is used in foods around the world unfortunately i wasn t looking for any of these things 
don t bother the irish culture according to an an englishman s perspective truth maybe some of it stereotypes yes 
don t bother with this one i saw this at the bookstore and read through it i can t imagine who would have use for this book it is an illustrated guide to design and has numerous pictures of various door styles it is a very poor how to book and even includes metal doors and drawers why would anyone include metal fabrication in a woodworking book many of the kitchen photos are out of focus the only interesting portion of the entire book was on page which explained how to create snap together window grills aka mullions the end of the book is filled with photos of the author s door production facility and this would be interesting to which group of woodworkers all in all this book is not worthy of linden publishing who usually produces outstanding works 
false history george g m jones knows not a thing about real history claiming that the great library of alexandria is where aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by ptolemy ii the ptolemic line was the successor line in egypt alexander himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of egypt the priests of egypt viewed him as the son of zeus these priests were of the god ammon who were told at his oracle the egyptian mysterey system was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax the first greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of babylonian and egyptian thought they added reasoning something none existant in egyptian or babylonian thought even saying that ancient egyptians were all black is wrong as the people of egyptian constituted a mixture of races they were black and white they were in fact semites like the jews and arabs people who are caucasian skin color alone does not tell a man s race an indian from india is in reality caucasian making him closer to europeans than the japanese or chinese even most the languages of india and iran are indo european while the basque live in france and spain but speak a language isolate if the greeks stole anything from anyone it was the phoneicians and their alphabet something that is the ancestor to the greek latin etruscan cyrillic hebrew and arabic alphabets the name kemet was a reference to the black soil of egypt today it is called misr anyways 
a sad waste of paper babbling brooks are better having read many books on various financial subjects this one is on my list as one of the top wastes of time in fact i am only writting this to hopefully save you time ! warning ! when the reviews are from annonymous a reader be suspicious

you ve got to be kidding obviously creationists confuse the question has evolution occurred with the question what is the cause of evolution the scientific answer to the first question is of course yes and the answer to the second question at least in part is natural selection what logic and evidence leads scientists to these answers the logic of evolutionthe conclusion that evolution has occurred is drawn from two simple observations observation living things come only from living things spontaneous generation is not possible when living things are already in existence observation fossil remains show that living things in the remote past were very different from living things today thereforeconclusion life has changed through time evolveda dramatic proof of the thesis that life has changed through time is seen in the fossil record of the vertebrates animals having a segmented backbone at the beginning of the cambrian period million years ago there were no vertebrates at all later in the cambrian problematic forms appeared which seem to have been related to the vertebrates but showed distant affinities with the echinoderms as well echinoderms today are represented by starfish sea lilies sea cucumbers etc embryologically they appear to compose the phylum most closely related to the chordata the phylum to which vertebrates belong toward the end of the cambrian period the first vertebrates appeared the ostracoderms jawless fishes possessed of a bony armor plate and having flattened bodies apparently adapted to a bottom feeding way of life according to the fossil record vertebrates went without jaws for many millions of years finally at the beginning of the devonian period million years ago the first fish with jaws entered their remains into the record in the rocks at the very end of the devonian or the beginning of the carboniferous period million years ago the first primitive amphibians arose these fish like animals differed from their air breathing fish ancestors mostly in their elaboration of the bony structure of the paired appendages converting fins into hands and feet and in reinforcement of the structures attaching the paired appendages to the spinal column the first reptiles did not appear until the last half of the carboniferous period to give the lie to creationist claims that there are no connecting link fossils to join the vertebrate classes the permian period million years ago saw the appearance of an entire order of animals the mammal like reptiles therapsida which can be seen to change with time from typical primitive reptiles into primitive mammals it was not until late in the triassic period million years ago that the therapsid mammal transmutation was complete contrary to the first chapter of genesis which claims that the first mammals appeared on the earth a mere twenty four hours after the first fish the first mammals did not appear on earth until more than million years of fish evolution had transpired birds which according to both creation myths in genesis were created on the same day as fish do not enter the fossil record until the jurassic period million years ago representing an ultimate variation on the dinosaur theme birds trace their descent from reptiles quite different from those ancestral to the mammals contrary to the claims of some creationists evolutionists do not claim that reptiles evolved into birds and birds evolved into mammals even though the first mammals appeared in the triassic period forms for which the english language has names would not appear until the late cretaceous million years ago when opossum like forms appeared the eocene epoch million years ago when primitive whales originated and the oligocene epoch million years ago when apes monkeys and primitive grazing mammals appeared the record in the rocks thus is evidence either for fishes evolving into birds and mammals or it is evidence of thousands of successive special creations magical replacements of successive faunas by slightly different ones curiously the latter interpretation is as unbiblical as it is unscientific if either of the biblical myths were true all types of vertebrates living types of mammals birds reptiles amphibians and fishes would be found along with bacteria and trilobites at the very beginning of the fossil record and would be extractable from all rock layers of later ages but of course nothing could be farther from reality the infamous gaps in the fossil record adduced by creationists as evidence against evolution are actually a devastating refutation of the idea that all forms of life were miraculously zapped onto the earth at the same time the logic of natural selectionsince creationists in their attacks of evolution in general and of natural selection in particular usually obfuscate the scientific principles involved and generally substitute a straw man which is easier to ridicule it is important that we state clearly just what it is that science has to say on the topic of how new species come to be the modern synthetic theory of natural selection consists of a tightly interwoven fabric of observations and logical conclusions drawn from them in a nutshell the structure of the theory is the following observation all living things tend to reproduce in geometric progression so that if all offspring survived the entire earth would be overrun by them observation in fact however the earth is not so overrun the populations of various species remain approximately constant in size from century to century due to the finite resources of the environment thereforeconclusion a there must be a competition for the available resources of the environment a struggle for existence observation heritable variations mutations are observed to occur spontaneously from time to time in populations of all species observation in a given environment some of these variations are helpful in the struggle for existence and others are harmful or neutral thereforeconclusion b a natural selection of individuals will result those with helpful mutations will survive and expand in numbers and those with harmful mutations will tend to perish and be reduced in numbers observation the source of inheritable changes is either change in the sequence of chemical bases in the dna molecules making up an organism s genes rearrangement of genes on chromosomes or multiplication or deletion of genes or chromosomes observation physically and chemically speaking there is no limit to the amount of base changing possible in dna or the amount of gene rearrangement which can take place thereforeconclusion c there will be no limit to the amount of variation possible in any given species given enough time and changing environmental conditions mutation will add to mutation and any species will gradually change into one or more new species as mutations cause greater and greater cumulative change and as sexual recombination assembles novel hereditary ensembles species will turn into new genera genera into new families etc with the exception of the observations concerning changes in dna and chromosomes as the source of evolutionary variation the theory above was discovered by charles darwin in the middle of the last century darwin came to his theory grudgingly he had originally been a creationist himself but the facts of nature which he uncovered in his trip around the world on h ms beagle forced him to give up the genesis mythology in favor of evolutionary science and made him formulate the theory of natural selection it is not often remembered that darwin was not the only person to discover the principle of natural selection at the same time that darwin was formulating his theory alfred russell wallace completely independent of darwin and half a world away was forced by his study of the plants and animals of the malay archipelago to conclude that evolution had occurred and that natural selection was the motive force the lesson to be learned from this is that the facts of nature compel unbiased minds to conclude that evolution has occurred and that natural selection is at least a part of the cause of evolutionary change population size and genetic isolation of populations are also important factors affecting the degree to which evolutionary change will occur as we examine the bizarre details of the genesis creation myth however we must ask is it conceivable that any person not already aware of the first genesis myth could go out into the world of nature and conclude that green plants came into existence before the sun that birds existed before reptiles without knowledge of the second genesis myth who would come up with the idea that man is older than both plants and animals but that woman did not come into existence until the last animal species had appeared without being brainwashed by the noah s ark tale what geologist would conclude that the whole planet was covered by a shell of water years ago what independent observer would conclude that the kiwi which can neither swim nor fly came to new zealand from mt ararat in turkey but couldn t make it to greece or australia could anyone conclude that there was once a firmament in the sky with windows in it and water above it of course not but we can be quite sure that even if the creationist legions of darkness should succeed in eradicating all knowledge of darwin s theory honest men and women of the future studying the facts of nature would discover it anew this is because evolutionary science is science and is true in the sense that it is testable and accords with the facts of nature the creationist dogmas however are not science and to the extent that they are testable are contradicted by the testimony of nature 
there was a reason it was in the for section in borders what could have been a hilarious informative account of breaking outlandish old fashioned laws and getting or not getting in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young british guys i think the author is around wryly making fun of america s perceived backwardness sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and when they couldn t they outright gave up on some great chances the swedish girls in frisco why include it if it didn t come to fruition and furthermore involved no lawbreaking i m still wondering why they included their page tour of hearst castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log cool hearst had greco roman statues in his poolroom they don t get arrested and they don t really accomplish anything too bad 
polo anyone hardly as another commenter indicated this book is written by someone who only wished he was a polo player it s frighteningly inaccurate and i can t believe that one polo player in the world would agree with the presentations or should i say misrepresentations provided within the book but to focus on the pathetic longings of a man who cannot even understand the rudimentary principles and practices of an elegant and beautiful sport that he wishes to focus his novel on is not even enough no the content of the book is entirely jumbled with ridiculous sexual escapades merely placed in convenient intervals to titillate domesticated bookworms who may find men and women and transvestites and transsexuals sodomizing each other interesting fortunately i didn t buy this book and with the cold weather upon us i now have the kindling i need to start the yule log so thanks jerzy 
don t bother to wake me up i have enjoyed several books by anna quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering i settled down for an evening of reading nights in a row before i finally gave up i found the writing trite and boring i didn t care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something i m wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow s ear rise and shine not this time 
not worth the effort i found the book disappointing in that it depends on the interpretation of experience being a legitimate means of proving the existence of a deity i don t need this book for that also the christological bent of this author is offputting giving the sense that he s not able to step back far enough to sense whether his views are in truth as objective as he pretends them to be or as i sense them to be subjective wishful thinking 
smile and have happy thoughts i expected a lot more profundity about this topic there are much better works out there than this the book is evidence that one cannot assume that because a writer has many books published that hey keep getting better ofthen the revers as here where the audience in mind is simple people who find worn out bromides helpful try angel dust insted 
a real downer this book is such a downer besides the ridiculous sibling rivalry between two grown up sisters and all of the complicated problems between julie romeo s families we have an eight year old sarah running the show in julie s house besides watching charlie the chocolate factory endlessly she manipulates adults in to buying her lottery tickets they have their very own veruca salt living in that house ! if you want to read a depressing story about an extremely dysfunctional family and a woman with no backbone this is the book for you it s a shame because i really enjoyed the first one 
illegal surgery and the medical community the daughter of a prominent boston doctor is dead apparently from a botched abortion which was illegal in the late s dr john berry s friend art lee is in jail for the crime which he says he didn t commit so dr berry sets out to prove his friend s innocence and runs into cover ups and lots of secrets but there are many doubts such as was the girl really pregnant and did dr lee actually perform the surgery and why is dr berry so interested in finding the culprit for michael crichton s first novel it s not bad but nowhere near as good as some later ones the plot is marginally interesting but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn t sound very natural dr berry who just takes the whole work week off to investigate talks more like a cheesy private eye than a doctor also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts nice to know but annoying to look up 
text offers little if any scientific merit the book was an interesting enough read to keep in my library but i would not consider it a legitimate argument for the aquatic ape theory nor specifically for the aquatically influenced evolution of the human female and the proceeding ramifications it approaches the issue in a simplistic unscientific manner that is not at all convincing keeping in mind that this book is dated having been first published in could not save it s argument either the descent of woman left just me as i was before and i ll be looking further still for writings on the subject 
in a word dry not to put too fine a point on it but this book is dry almost like a text book there is very little action and or suspense brought forth about involvement in the angola operation and what could have been was quickly blunted with operational and bureaucratic detail and that s how the book drags on with excruciating detail in one part mr stockwell describes what he did to finally get a desk to work from at langley by sitting in the hall in everyone s way and stacking his papers up beside him what took him pages to describe should ve been done in a simple paragraph to be fair the book is written from the viewpoint of an intelligence staffer not a cloak and dagger operative yes there might be some interest in how inefficient the cia was operating back in the mid s but that s true for most large government organizations he also describes some of the political machinations between officials within the cia again mildly interesting but nothing notable some of the descriptions of dialog and reactions of persons seems contrived almost as if he or some ghost writer added these things for effect it almost reads like a fiction novel in that respect rather than writing a solid crisp account with thoughtful and concise opinions about cia policy and inner workings the book devolves often times into monotonous detail however in the latter chapters the account does get more interesting as he discusses plausible deniability and the deception of the cia to hide their involvement one of the more interesting parts is the organizational background and resources needed to run an operation of this type including the shipping of weapons and ammo the propaganda strategy the political workings thru committees the state department and the president to gain support etc the book does makes one wonder what other rebellions or conflicts the cia was involved in over the last years and is an eye opener about our nations espionage policies on this level the book succeeds but in the end the book was almost a grind to finish i d only recommend this one for the hard core spook fan 
disappointing book about a fascinating subject i picked this book up after after enjoying savage pastimes another book by the same author and hoped for an informative and gruesome book about an infamous serial killer depraved was in places but the presentation was lacking and the book had no focus and far too much irrelevant courtroom drama it opens up properly with a thumbnail sketch of the times h h howard s infamous crimes and more background info it then lists some formative experiences from his childhood and gives a short bio of his life up to the point he turned to murder after that it loses its way though with endless discussion of holmes travels around the country as he tries to perpetrate a minor insurance scam and then far too many pages on his murder trail surprisingly his trial is for the murder of a henchmen in an insurance scam and he s never charged or prosecuted for the dozens of other far more interesting murders he committed unfortunately those are hardly mentioned in the book at all and are not discussed in any detail going by the middle of the book you d think it was a biography about a small time hustler scam artist and bigamist who eventually got carried away and murdered a partner and was subsequently tried and executed for it the fact that he killed maybe other people built this incredible murder mansion tortured dozens of people and was the world s first documented serial killer is almost an afterthought lets be honest the hook of the book the reason anyone reads it is that it s about h h holmes who killed a lot of people in various horrible ways at a time in history when that sort of thing was almost completely unknown that s what the reader wants to know about in as much detail as possible with lots more about the mazelike corridors soundproof rooms sealed vaults oversized furnaces and chutes leading down to the cellar that the book jacket talks about unfortunately you get hardly more detail about those things than the book jacket says with no detailed descriptions of anything no charts or diagrams or photographs no eyewitness accounts and not even any speculation about how the crimes went down what you do get are maybe pages out of the total covering his seemingly endless and aimless cross country travels while dodging the cops and tediously plotting to murder his assistant in a life insurance scam hoodwink his widow and dispose of the guy s children ten or fifteen pages would have been sufficient for that section but instead it covers at least most of it of the traveled from chicago to baltimore checked into two different hotels under different names didn t buy the poor girls new shoes etc variety it s as boring as it sounds from my summary worse yet we then revisit that entire story when it all gets relived during holmes trial which ends in his conviction for the murder of his henchmen as part of a life insurance scam the author covered that section in so much detail for an obvious reason he could just pluck it all from newspaper articles at the time since there was extensive coverage of holmes in the media of the day far far less coverage is given to the castle itself or holmes serial killing and there s virtually nothing about why holmes became what he was we get one short childhood incident lots of unsourced comments about his practicing torture on animals as a child and then bang he s being hung for one minor murder with almost no details about the bulk of his crimes we know everything about a crime we don t much care about and almost nothing about all of the crimes we wanted to learn about and that s a definite flaw i was skimming paragraphs and whole chapters by page or so bored with the irrelevant courtroom drama and wanting to get past his conviction for one life insurance scam murder and on to more about his real crimes basically this is a decent first draft of a book about h h holmes but it needs substantial editing to add detail about his castle and murders needs to have at least pages of redundant and boring reportage about his travels removed and needs much more psychological analysis and discussion about holmes and the society in which he lived my final seldom used non fiction scores concept presentation writing quality presents explains the topic clearly entertainment value rereadability overall 
not the best portrayal of pre civil war america beloved is one of the most famous novels by toni morrison america s only female to win the nobel prize in literature set in the america before the civil war the story moves from the slave south to the non slave north free the north is not as this book depicts for slaves could be captured and returned down south the book is conglomeration of multiple themes and storylines first and foremost is the story of sethe a black woman who used to be a slave second the book focuses on her baby who died at birth who goes by the name beloved and the reappearance of the baby as a ghost third the book examines slavery racism and the politics of inclusion and seclusion in the south sethe is excluded from civil society in many ways by her color and the institution of slavery but being a slave is an integral part of society in general in the north she is not a slave per say but instead she is excluded from society in general by the ways of white people and their benign racism the storylines of this book also explore the physical punishments and practices used to enforce slavery at the personal level here is where this book stands out from others like it like uncle tom s cabin or huck finn this book could be described as doing for black literature on slavery as what passion of the christ did for movies based on the bible it is quite graphic with big servings of the natural thrown in but i would not use this book as a study of slavery and the racism built into it the text is very confusing and i the reader spent much time trying to understand the entity of beloved and its use in furthering the story in fact i would call this book a tragedy not about slavery and racism but a tragedy set against the backdrop of slavery and racism overall a difficult book to read and though not boring is not on my list of great american works 
is hillary clinton a lesbian who freaking cares i rarely ever fail to complete a book i ve paid for but after about sixty pages of edward klein s docudrama i don t know if i ll be finishing instead of a historical summary about hillary clinton s life and policies klein elected to open with a series of tenuously credible accounts from interns who witnessed marital strife between her and bill accusations that she s a secret lesbian and obvious observations such as criticism of her seemingly inborn political nature i didn t see the makings of any ruminations on the real reasons to question the merits of mrs clinton s candidacy ie blatant nepotism in federal government her relative lack of charisma to inspire the masses the failure of the first clinton administration in response to the uss cole bombing etc instead klein seems content at least in intoductary chapters to make glib carpet muncher referances about mrs clinton his thesis for why she would make a bad president the minimum price of this book is skyrocketing upwards of twenty dollars if you don t like money then buy it 
faster a list of facts and speculations i obviously did not conducting enough research before buying this book i am seventeen and this was an easy read but i was hoping for and expecting a philosophical examination of our speedy lives instead i was bombarded by semi interesting useless facts about how our world has been struck by hurrysickness and how everything has been accelerated a fairly obvious fact if you are consious enough of our world to buy this book because of its title for yourself it will not raise you conciousness with any deep philosophical questions or with any solutions the only people who will benefit from this book are the ones who will never buy it for themselves therefore i believe this book is basically useless and slightly boring 
not a history book this book should be placed in the historical fiction section it is not a history book ! the author was so skewed and biased that it was laughable i would not recommend that this book be used for any serious history class his portrayal of the roman catholic church was very biased as he narrated his own perspective on history it was hard to take him very seriously because of his own personal prejudices homeschoolers beware 
an accountant s dream or mozart on the couch i read up to chapter twenty about pages and stopped reading the book realizing i had more important things to read my major complaints are that there is too much discussion of the mozart family finances which i m sure would be fascinating to economists and accountants however tedious to someone concerned about music and too much retroactive freudian analysis of the subject wolfgang amadeus mozart think about this solomon uses an obsolete and now debunked system of psychoanalysis to describe a subject that cannot be interviewed the best discussion of music is concerning the salzburg serenade style in chapter eight other than that brief section pp i was not impressed short of reading mozart s letters and making your own analysis i recommend stanley sadie s mozart the early years for starters 
toxic psyachiatry is toxic for parents of the mentally ill i was going to assign this book to my students in my abnormal psychology class the first chapter is powerful and true however this author irresponsibly attacks the parents of the mentally ill as responsible for their children s illnesses he also attacks nami the national association of the mentally ill an organization that has helped more mentally ill patients recover find support and their way to a successful and meaningful life and has truly educated more people about mental illness than breggin has ever done himself i am sure the good points the book makes about inadequate and even harmful psychiatric care in mental institutions are in my opinion obfuscated by his unwarranted attacks on parents attacks i believe that may be a result of his old fashioned psychoanalytical training 
very basic historic reference work not much more i bought this book expecting to learn more details on the design and development of this rifle and to have a reference work to show some examples of this design ok it fills that bill for the average enthusiast but i found the slightly politicized content the less than acceptable technical descriptions and a few mistakes i count no less than six reversed photographs to make the overall book a below par experience a technical book like this should have had a competent technical editor i see no evidence of this 
movie guide the book is comprehensive very seldom you try to look up a picture or video which is not in the book the reviews are sometimes too short however the book would be too unhandy if every picture had a bigger review also the facts about the different movies are accurate and helpful 
not mieville s best work i m a big fan of both perdido street station and the scar compared to these earlier works iron council was a huge disappointment in both the writing and story it was at times very painful to read and i was so excited to finally be finished if you are new to mieville start with perdido street station if you are a big fan and looking for more from new crobuzon be prepared to be disappointed 
very disappointing today i looked at the genuine leather edition of the esv single column i love the translation and the format but the paper is so thin there is ridiculous bleedthrough since the print is only pt a crisp and clean page is critical for readability because the paper is so thin it is easy to read the opposite side of the page additionally the leather and the binding seem less than ideal i have waited a long time for a side column edition of the esv and it looks like i will have to wait even long for another publisher to produce one why crossway would go to all the trouble of producing a new edition only to use such an inferior paper is beyond me 
dislike i did not like the book because it skip around too much between characters i could not understand the characters it wasn t really abour roller skating i just wanted to read about roller skating 
deceptive advertising bulletin board ideas is the only item i have bought from amazon that displeased me it is religious in nature yet there was no mention of that fact when i bought it ms lee s cutesy ideas are not academic in nature there is absolutely not one academically based idea in the book and i was not even able to give the book away despite knowing a couple of catholic school teachers the book would only be helpful to those who teach pre kindergarten in a christians only school star for the rating is still one too many 
ennobling ambiguity obtuse ill concieved and at times poorly organized this book was the bane of my undergraduate medieval europeclass i found it to have little value in understanding the cult of ennobled love in medieval europe few times did i actually garner new insight about the subject and to make matters worse i not only had to write a paper on it i also was not fortunate enough to purhase it on amazon com i bought at my campus bookstore and i ended up paying more for it 
lost i was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did there is no plot the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive i would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee how exciting is that 
movie is better than book this is one of the few instances that i have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself this is a contrived work through and through and one can understand why bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm chair psychology that is truly laughable and this is probably his best novel 
good reference book this book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter paranormal investigator provides good case histories as well as ghost stories that can be used as examples on investigations 
hardly as original as blood music and the micros are psychologically too much like people but it does raise a number of interesting points and it s a fun read and i wanted to give it stars but amazon is insisting on two 
not her best or even close the sad thing is i am a major andre norton fan and i didn t enjoy this book very much i trudged through it out of loyalty but i sure don t recommend it the triplets take turns talking which would be fine if in any way norton had given them different voices unlike say terry goodkind who can have many characters voice and they are all truly unique the triplets have nothing distinguishing them therefore its distracting too much going on and frankly you just don t much care the strange man they meet has so little of him that well its just a poorly written book and quite a disappointment 
cheap totally junky do not waste your money we got this for our kids who are big pirates fans this toy should never have been released it s a piece of junk to make a quick buck from the movie it s a junky non functional ripoff of the classic viewmaster concept and while my kids can work viewmaster this telescope in no way works there are several major design flaws the disks holding the picture don t center so the pic won t show up the disk pops out when you try to turn to the next picture and won t stay in if you so much as move the telescope you can t even see the picture unless the telescope is totally collapsed which is tough since the wobbly piece of junk won t stay shut and if your kid can get all this stuff right you are rewarded with a blurry barely visible image i ve bought a lot of toys and don t always expect perfection but this is seriously the junkiest hunk of i have ever purchased whoever churned this out in time for the p otc marketing blitz has surely never met any kids or any quality control personnel i wish i could give less than one star thank god the designer of this is only making children s toys and not airplanes or cars 
don t bother no value added i read two third of the book and i feel less intelligent for it mr hoque used the letter quotequot in front of every big word and never illustrated how quotequot or internet would actually change the business environment the internet allows information to flow to almost anyone and in a business environment this can add tremendous value yet mr hoque never explained or showed how this would occur also his analysis on the supplier value chain was so superficial that no value could be gained from reading that section 
not helpful not worth reselling i just threw this book away not even worth trying to re sell wish there were negative stars for ratings i got this book when we decided to give ivf a try and maybe my mistake was getting this book after years of infertility treatments the information in the book was very dated reading through the author s experiences was extremely traumatic for me but after spending a day upset over how bad the book made the ivf process seem i realized that a large part of the author s bad experiences came from her having doctors who might have been the best medical doctors ever but who had little compassion for their patients and then reading through her incessant whining about how much she hated needles infertility is a medical condition but no one was forcing her to take shots nor was her life riding on that medicine unlike many people who have to take shots of life saving medicines every day even her bluntness was annoying sometimes her sorry but that s the way it is writing style might truly reflect her experiences but my years of infertility treatment experiences have not been like that there are many different types of infertility treatments and many different styles of res doctors you do not have to put up with competent but uncompassionate medical care 
very pretty book some ideas but not that good quotthe home organizing workbook quot by meryl starr is the type of book that is design to catch the reader attention of the shelve but once the reader takes a close look at it the reader begins to realize that while it has some useful information there are better organizing books on the market if you are interesting reading it just check it out and save your money 
gloating biased is the main goal of every male evo psy writer to attack feminism here s an experiment for you juxtapose the ideas in this book and say pinker s blank slate with those of i don t know any two female evo psi writers and watch the incongruities jump off the pages it s f ing comical but guess what the females books are way better thought out and accurate while the males are a lot of wishful thinking hmmm aging successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging successful males are made for each other that men are wired to treat sexually liberated women like s and to fawn over repressed chastity obsessed airheads whatever 
hopefully this series will improve unlike cussler s other series i found this first story of the oregon files slow going at first and rather confusing there are just too many things going on no problem i suppose for multi taskers and way too many characters to keep track of also there s little to no character development even of mr chairman juan cabrillo the fact that he and his companions are mercenaries with a penchant for good deeds that pay well doesn t compare favorably with the numa heroes however the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides i expect from mr cussler and co writers i look forward to the subsequent oregon files with high hopes 
what is prerequisite before reading this book i bought this book a week ago and spent one and half hour for quick overview im studying intermediate calculus with linear algebra well my impression was it s very difficult to read there are very few examples with solution all the context written without diagrams 
not what i was looking for at all i admit it the steps to raw foods should have given away that this book is just a rehash of steps what i expected was an actual step program to familiarizing myself with raw food and processes and grocery lists this book is so subjective it kind of turned me off from the raw movement it s a little creepy actually someone please suggest me a better raw food book 
too old fashioned this book provides an interesting framework but lacks the modern thinking of the third wave by smith and fingar and contains more of the old business process reengineering stuf 
bill s asskisszone read andrea makris law suit at www thesmokingguncom all the dirty details are there and should be required reading for anyone who reads o reilly or takes him seriously he settled the case after smearing her and threatening her he s a little wimp and a coward and a loofa loving creep keep him away from your children ! i know the guy from washingtonjeff gannon 
a tease a book which is not bad as a quickie read on the basics of camille but it comes up quite short as an authoritative source on the storm many survivors stories while compelling at times begin to sound repetitive and strangely enough leave the reader with a sense that not all has been told it is also quite apparent that the author is a born again christian as he often elects to print survivor contentions that they were saved from the storm by their personal lord and savior jesus christ not that this is bad per se but is does add to the repetitiveness of the narrative and after hearing it once it seems superfluous as well as adding a hidden agenda to the text this is not a national geographic style book about camille it tends to stay on a base emotional level hardly detached never scientific and certainly not the last word on the topic a disappointment in short 
action adventureyes compelling no although his interesting childhood kept you glued to the first quarter of the book the rest is just a basic cowboy s life written with little or no techniques to keep you compelled to read every word it is interesting to read however since he was a true to life cowboy if i had to do over i d saved my money 
the most boaring book alive the book is called the circuit this book is about a boy named francisco jimenez who wants to be another person he had a hard time in school because he almost knew no english he couldn t understand her he had brothers and sister and a mom and dad the worst thing to him was getting deported in school he had a problem with kids named curtis and his friend they were the bullies once francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to curtis of course he didn t know he was lucky they didn t beat him up later they became friends his brother that was born after him had a rare disease but he made it through i think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives after every chapter he wanted you to put the book down he didn t leave any suspense i hated the book so much 
too much hyp for an okay book i have heard that this is a children s book and perhaps there are abridged versions but i have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense verbose novel and understand the subtle underlying themes swift portrays i have heard many positive reviews concerning this book and although there are many insightful points perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion for very often i got lost in the words and nonending references to english politics on the other hand it s important to note that in the early th century english satire was probably extremely dry very different from today huh and hard to follow all in all this book is an exploration into man s true nature and despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge expresses a mature intellect that reflects swift s intelligence 
not an impressive diet book tells you nothing you don t already know and really didn t offer much advise 
too much fat this book has some good information but you have to wade through the fat to get at it it may be written mainly for aspiring college students but i feel it is not complete enough or deep enough for parents there are many other better books out there on the subject notably fiancial aid for dummies and discounts and deals at the nations best colleges 
silly nostalsgic nonsense having spent most of my adult life working in the non profit conservation field and as a parent and as someone who had the good fortune to spend lots of time in nature as a child i read this book in the hopes of learning important things that turned out to be a forlorn hope by a quarter of the way through i was rolling my eyes by the halfway mark i was actively insulted that this author would expect anyone to buy what he was shoveling i finished the thing only out of grim curiosity louv has about three major points a american kids circa are much less active outdoors than american kids circa were b that change is due to computers personal injury lawyers and various other things that people louv s age don t like c being in nature is important to kids development and to human health generally point c is blindingly obvious is not news to anyone and is the only major point for which he offers any actual evidence which wouldn t get laughed out of the offices of a peer reviewed journal for points a and b he offers zero evidence nada zip absolutely nothing but anecdotes leading rhetorical questions and straw men he sounds like nothing so much as joseph mccarthy wondering whether communists might be undermining american foreign policy from within the state department indeed he uses precisely that rhetorical construction repeatedly always a signpost of intellectual flabbiness obvious logic flaws abound as do laugh outloud factual mistatements in the first half of the book i started jotting down glaring holes in his argument but gave up in disgust when i realized that most of his factual claims weren t even footnoted ! louv isn t even consistent in his straw men one moment he s talking about when he was a child s roughly and the next moment he s quoting somebody talking about how much kids were outdoors in or while he offers no actual evidence for his broad proposition of a new nature deficit disorder he does throw tangential facts around some of which i am in a professional position to quickly confirm i checked a half dozen such and the score was that he got substantially correct distorted beyond recognition and got dead wrong i could go on but enough already this thing isn t worth the paper it was printed on 
overpriced and of little value as a former novell mcne i was expecting the same excellent coverage novell provided in their cne and mcne certification books but i was shockingly disappointed for example look up the route command configuring routes on page there are two short paragraphs of introduction on the first page and two screen shots on the second page one of the output from typing route and one of the man page for route i turned the page and what a shock we re onto the next objective nothing about relating entries in a route table to the route commands required to get them into the table no explanation of what a route means just the man page which is the motivation for most people to buy a linux book but not this one the rest of the book offers scant coverage of topics that cry out for attention of all the linux books on the market this is one of the last ones i would turn to for help this book has served to deter me from buying other novell books although the course and course books for sles appear to be much more what i was expecting in depth coverage and cheaper too if you get them used 
pretty worthless i m afraid this book is pretty useless as far as factual information goes few texts are properly cited and john paul i is quoted as saying all sorts of things ie condemning moses which it s pretty hard to credit many of his public speeches are available and they don t support the contentions made both david yallop s and john cornwell s books cover the same material and are vastly better though they write from very different perspectives 
worst book i ve ever read this book was required reading for my advanced placement english class i consider myself a lover of the written word i dream of someday becoming a novelist or at least an english teacher it usually takes me days to finish a book especially a good book it has taken me months to read this book it is not only boring but often times repetetive barbara kingsolver relates everything to september th granted this was a tragic day for our country and should always be remembered but i dont see why ms kingsolver found it necessary to write a whole novel about it i find even less necessary for this to be required reading every once in a while ms kingsolver finds the need to express herself with words that are a little more complicated than need be it was a less than pleasent read and i wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy 
i should have watched the movie i had to read this book for school i thought i would love it but it turns out i was wrong this book was mind numbing it is drawn out and boring i almost threw the book away and rented the movie i should have this books sucks don t waste your time reading it 
seaside atmosphere the only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere the seaside restaurants were enjoyable the storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
funny but often misses the point rock til you drop is the quintessential screed every quothipquotmusic journalist has against quotdinosaur rock quot trouble is he doesn t even examine his own facts he admits early on that quotblame has to be laid at the feet of the boomers who continually support these over thehill acts quot and then goes on to spend the rest of the book taking on jagger and townsend but that statement begs the question if people are willing to spend their money that way jagger and townsend have a right to keep delivering don t they we know cigarettes are bad but if no one bought them phillip morris would be out of business also strausbaugh takes on exclusively the behemoths of s fm radio ok so reo speedwagon sucks but what about tina turner if he had had the guts to take on the quotqueen of rock an roll quots crappy euro pop which makes up of her concerts before tossing out quotproud mary quot i would be more inclined to give him some props or how about the temptations touring with only one original member left ok he gets points for taking on icon patti smith also i find that people who hate s rock acts are really just reacting to the unbelievable overplayed ness of quotclassic rock quot stations imagine just imagine zep floyd or the stones had never sold more than a couple copies hard i know but just try they d be worshipped like the velvet underground and big star still the book is quite good for a laugh but best taken with the proverbial grain of salt 
unfair i usually like this author and have read almost all of her books however after reading this book i definitely felt cheated the book is well written and the characters were pleasing although i thought faith was not being true to her character as presented in earlier books in the series agatha christie used to say that a mystery writer must play fair with his or her readers all of the evidence and the clues must be laid out for the reader to try to solve the mystery before the author resolves it to do otherwise is to cheat the reader who has invested time in reading the book no reader had a chance to solve this mystery unless by sheer guessing once the murderer is revealed the reader realizes that it really could have been anyone and all the clues have meant nothing i was very disappointed so i will think twice about getting any of her new books 
christian fundamentalism dramatized even the avid trekie reader of the star trek science fiction novels movies and television series must suspend disbelief when he finds captain kirk saying beam me up scotty but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world wide rapture though the characters and their roles are fictitious the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer the story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass rapture event and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born again conversions in the september october issue of foreign affairs walt mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform billy graham s biography by strober notes that they criticized graham s new evangelism for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the tribulation force or as exemplified by jerry falwell s moral majority they are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the united nations mead notes that it is no coincidence that the left behind novels show the antichrist rising to power as the secretary general of the united nations the u s statistical abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially while evangelicals and liberals e g southern baptists lutherans presbyterians methodists and catholics are continuing their per capita declines such data and the reported popularity of these left behind novels indicate fundamentalism s growing appeal in reaction to contemporary american society i see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the left behind in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern american society and as conservative christians who believe it is better to stay behind and in not just a few respects they may be wise to do so thomas j hickey 
a fairy tale for adolescents i am a huge berg fan but this book did not cut it with me the main character patty is approaching mid life and desperately wants a child ethan was her first love and continues to be the love of her life he also loves patty dearly so what is the problem ethan is gay and his love for patty is that of a cherised long time friend they feel comfortable together patty asks ethan to impregnate her so they can raise a child but of course marriage is out of the question we are not talking in vitro fertilization here or anything that might be plausible but a pregnancy developed by a good old fashioned romp in the hay or in the case the bed ! patty gets her wish she has a baby girl in the end ethan also gets his wish he finds the love of his life in another man as for the baby well we can only hope everything worked out well for her too but we will never know because that is where the story ended the problem with the book has nothing to do with sexual orientation but the fact the plot and events were just too inconceivably far fetched for the past years two of my very best friends men have been in a committed gay relationship they are literary scholars and avid readers when i ran the scenario of this book by them to see what their reaction would be they thought either the book was nuts i was nuts for reading it or possibly both on top of that the book has a juvenile writing style that makes one wonder where berg s thought process was when she wrote it like picasso she must have been going through her blue period ms berg you missed the mark on this one 
just one long justification typically i enjoy non fiction anecdotal books about a subject i can relate to like mothering but this book feels like one long justification of the mothering style and feelings of the author she obviously feels guilty about the way she parented her children and is using this book as the vehicle to help herself feel right about her own choices there is no consideration given for mothers who actually do choose to stay at home would rather raise their children themselves than have someone else do it and who actually enjoy the time they spend with their children as stay athome moms she acts like these mothers are lying to themselves about their true aspirations she claims that couples that feature a stay athome mom and a primary breadwinner husband are backsliding into traditional roles if you re a working mom who feels guilty about the choices you ve made this book is for you otherwise keep looking 
another self indulgent heinlein novel heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention unfortunately these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein s final books we are also treated to some of heinlein s stock characters dirty old men horny female computers naked adolescent girls and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after would have a sparse population indeed as if this isn t enough heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing in spite of all their cameo appearances this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout heinlein s earlier novels written prior to are still fine fare for young people especially boys this novel as well as most of heinlein s later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption 
i don t agree with stars there is only one reason stephen thornton has spoiled marion s original masterpiece if you can get the nd edition which thornton didn t join yet just compare it with current one except this i dare to say this book is the best intermediate classical mechanics text book this was the bible of classical mechanics but not any more 
authorware this is a huge mistake in buying this issue wait until the reviese edition comes in there are too many mistakes throughout the book its fustrating not being able to finish most of the excercises because of typos or left out information 
type too tiny to bother i d heard about this book on some cable show and eagerly ordered it with the intent of reading a passage or two every day but i was really dismayed when i saw how unbelievably tiny the type is i don t have extraordinary problems with my eyes but if a book is uncomfortable to read then i m simply not going to bother the authors should complain to the publisher about the shoddy presentation rodale press was apparently trying to save some bucks and as a result buyers and the authors will be hurt there are similar books out there such as an incomplete education and you might consider taking a look at them before you spend your money on this one 
im in agreement with dr stinkface im moving over from vb to c so naturally i would like to see examples written in c so i can get the semantics down this book does not do that half in c half in vb fully useless next time release versions of the book or better yet write some of it in vb some in c some in python some in perl 
good writing good idea the writing is good from a technical standpoint i don t have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well the idea is a good one too what i can t get past is the character robert langdon langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second another thing i have trouble with is dan brown s knack for slowing the pace of the story things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense the problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff like playing fetch with a dog you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it s finally tossed this book is an easy read but i think it is a bit over rated 
not good this book is disappointing i don t think broderick understands the technology or its social impact which is a major problem considering the book is an attempt to explain the causes and effect on our lives of the spike he quotes a lot of people who are smarter than he is and basically regurgitates their ideas without interesting analysis and it s a lazy author who quotes paragraphs and long passages from articles and lectures instead of writing his own description and citing the source also the author seems strangely arrogant for someone who almost gets it he explains that everyone else calls nanotechnology nanotechnology or nano tech but i call it minting hunh maybe everyone else calls this book good or interesting but i call it boring which given the subject matter it shouldn t be and a waste of time for anyone who has thought about this stuff for more than a nanosecond or a minto second or what i call speck time 
horrible book this book scared me to death and i was for sure i would have a miscarriage made me feel like i was not worthy of pregnancy b c i was overweight ! my husband threw this book in the trash and we are better for it 
not worth the price any price my garage is a mess and i was hoping this book would give me ideas for getting it organized it gets off to a great start but that s as far as it goes for example it says that when the garage is a mess you cannot find things and have to go out and buy replacements all too true it also says that you must throw things away of course the problem is when it comes to making the garage nicer it refers the reader to sources for expensive storage cabinets and floor coverings i do not want to spend re doing my garage nor do i want to install thousands of dollars worth of cabinets the ideas presented in this book consist mainly of lists of expensive suppliers i would have preferred plans and ideas for do ityourself storage and shelving 
much ado about nothing there is very little of substance to this book with regard to concrete suggestions on strategies a person can use to work with add as an adult especially in the work place lots of stories there is great emphasis about enlisting the help of family friends coworkers people with add just want to work with it they don t want their world to be involved in it a very disappointing missive 
dreadful nathalie dupree is an adoptive southerner she was born in new jersey now there s nothing wrong with that we welcome everyone down here but she is not southern and she is decidedly not country folk anyone with a certificate from cordon bleu who owned a restaurant in social circle ga is not daisy duke i don t know how ms dupree came by her vaunted reputation when i watched her pbs series in i could not believe what a mess she made of her kitchen dirt and grit from leeks flew like gnats landing on the countertops and the floor the cake batter she accidentally poured through the handles of a dutch oven spilled all over the counter while making a half hearted effort at cleaning it up she said to the camera im sure you ll do better when you make it at home ya think the grits roll which sounds so good and which ms dupree claims won somebody in a cooking contest does not work all chess pies are made with a little cornmeal she seems stunned that her friend s recipe calls for it ok so the ham biscuits work and are tasty the homemade applesauce is very good but two decent recipes out of is nothing to brag about i was born and raised in north carolina and have lived here all my life i thought it was just me but over the past years i ve made a point of asking practically every southerner i meet this question and we all agree no one eats chicken gravy on cantaloupe i have no idea where that came from a bright fledging cook of or can tell you that if you throw the butter flour and milk in a saucepan all at the same time and start whisking you are not going to get a cream sauce most good home cooks can tell you that you cannot freeze a chicken dish made with cucumbers i could go on except i haven t gotten to why i think ms dupree is a snob there are numerous recipes in this book which she prefaces by saying this recipe is from my dear friend former student cooking teacher it s wonderful but here s my version there s even a recipe called puff pastry my way p s it s no better than puff pastry made anybody else s way im glad i didn t spend any money on my copy it was a gift i ll stick with my files of my grandmothers recipes mrs dull s southern cooking and the southern cookbook from the unc press 
uninformed a book of generalizations for his cult i ve been confused by michael medved s position on film ever sinse he posed a question in the wall street journal asking what happened to the missing moviegoers he was speaking about the end of the production code censorship in hollywood and how that coincided with a drop off in movie attendance yesmovies seriously changed in the late s as filmmakers were allowed to depict subject matter previously forbidden i m not sure what he is trying to prove here everyone stopped going to the movies because of this so it had nothing to do with attendance dropping since the mid s with vietnam with the death of urban movie palaces and the total change of the movie going experience the public s boredom with overblown roadshow attractions with television no actually because in mr medved s world you can trace anything and everything to a lack of morals he points out that the sound of music won best picture in and then midnight cowboy about a male hustler won best picture in thereby proving the decline and fall of western civilization so i guess nevermind how many family movies of this time period hello dolly doctor dolittle chitty chitty bang bang greatest story ever told were total and complete bombs at the box office he states that removal of the production code remember the decline and fall of western civilization hurt the bottom line and apparently movies have just been utter filth ever since so christians would be hypocritical to own dvds of the films that came out just after the removal of the code that could not have been made before it the wild bunch the grauduate whos afraid of virginia woolf the producers rosemarys baby midnight cowboy bonnie and clyde all of those movies did great at the box office by the way so i m lost as to how the removal of the production code wrecked the bottom line in hollywood oh yes one other thing michael medved did the glowing introduction to demille s the ten commandments at the conservative film festival or whatever its called in demilles film the sign of the cross jam packed with violence sexual perversion helped contribute to the catholic revolt against films and the enforcement of the code itself some scholar you guys got here

changing minds deviates from the topic harvard psychologist howard gardner s book on the art of changing minds and affecting opinions has an appealing pull written by a qualified professional in the field the book is another output of the impressive harvard business school press the book advances the view that there are seven what it calls layers or levers that affect a change of opinion these factors whose titles all begin with re are reasonresearchresonanceresistancesreal world events resources and rewards and representational redescriptionsgardner subsequently proceeds to elaborate on each of the factors within contexts such as an institution among a population up close or as relate s to one s own mind so far so good many would say alas the reader is compelled to add so what to the phrase changing minds is indeed the work of a qualified professional but the reader is neither provided evidence nor shown the techniques and history behind the author s conclusions furthermore being the work of a researcher in an academic setting readers should not expect practical instructions or employable techniques rather changing minds concentrates on the mechanics and psychological hypothesis in this manner the book is very much a scholastic paper finally there is scant evidence that the author employs his own teachings little proof research or reason is offered here to be convincing or allay any of the readers resistances similarly dismissed is the need for charts sub titles illustrations indented or highlighted points or synopses furthermore and more ominously the author makes several practical mistakes in the way he reads or interprets the world rendering some of his data and experiences suspect he claims that schools are agents of change and serve to instill different opinions in youngsters those are his opinions and not supported by any empirical data he does not provide any supporting data either in fact the contrary is true schools are designed to breed uniformity and teach adherence obedience and group activity barely a student will pass physics class were he to challenge a prevalent theory a law student will probably find himself choosing a new major should he differ with prescribed laws similarly imagine a student disagreeing with the outcome of world war ii an astrology student disputing the form of nova stars or at an elementary level a high school student butting heads with his classmates and instructors another error is the assumption that events have lead to fundamental change even in thought process of political leaders let me quote from the book while gardner cites the example of george w bush following september many scholars and historians have shown that far from changing his mind the us president instead leveraged the event to more resolutely drive his pre existing agenda much of what transpired following the events of the day were the accelerations of the american president and his officials overt and covert ideas and strategies gardner terms the new bush a multilateralist uncomfortably sovereign countries and a lack of support from the united nations would disagree moreover despite such fierce opposition bush proceeded with his plans nonetheless further down the pages the author condemns stalin s pact with hitler as cronyism he conveniently forgets or omits the allies earlier pact with hitler or the west s subsequent treaty with the extremely paranoid stalin in short being a tenured academic gardner himself seems most susceptible to institutional tunnel vision and in need of constructive cognitive dissonance lacking the appeal of practicality the burden of proof or applicable relevance set in actual events changing minds the art and science of changing our own and other people s minds is solely of interest to researchers in need of alternate sources on the topic gardner does not provide any empirical basis for his opinions which also deviate from the title and stated scope of the book 
awful i bought this book purely on the strength of its being written by jeffrey deaver however less than pages into this terrible novel it becomes very hard to believe that it was written by the same man who brought us the bone collector and the coffin dancer the fact that it was written in before deaver was established may explain some of its mediocrity but there is no excuse for the fact that this is simply a terrible book the basic plot is that rune a supremely annoying punk discovers a favourite customer of hers shot to death when she goes to his apartment to collect a video he has rented times in one month the film is a true story about a manhattan bank robbery in which a police officer steals a million dollars which he hides away and which has never been found in the biggest jump to a conclusion i have ever come across rune decides that the the depiction of what was done with the money in the film is real and that mr kelly found it and makes up her mind to find it herself the plot of the book probably could have been fairly good but deaver ruins the entire story with rune the most unrealistic and annoying heroine i have ever read she lives in a fantasy world that a year old child would be too mature for and has no concept of the real world whatsoever everything about her from her appearance to her manner of speaking to her ridiculous inability to lie makes the reader want to punch the book as it s the nearest thing possible to punching her in the face another major problem with this novel is its glaring predictability there are no twists and turns in it and if deaver thought anything in it was going to shock the reader then he must have been as naive as rune herself this book is chock full of cliches that were probably old even in this book has nothing to offer the discerning reader and it probably better left to those who see reading as hard work and only do it to reassure themselves that they can once in a while complete and utter rubbish 
some good stories not a great collection there are some good things as well as some bad things about micro fiction the good thing about this book is that it has variation in the texture and tone of the stories my favorite would have to be morning news which was written by the author himself also the author has managed to touch on many different subject matters however the bad news is that many of the stories in the book are not very well written some of it is formula fiction and i had trouble understanding the meaning behind a couple of them the upside is that the book costs less than 
ask a silly question richard rothstein is no more qualified to advise on education than the new governor of california who is a body builder the objective of education is economic self sufficiency getting ahead in life requires connections not knowledge american blacks are denied connections we all know why and how the black white gap which rothstein writes about is not information but access valuable knowledge is learned on the job not in school teachers do not control access employers do blacks who are told otherwise are being cheated centuries ago schools were for the elite whose privileged positiion in life was predestined this was not changed by free public schools america s political leaders never learned this fundamental lesson us grant who in fact liberated blacks imagined blacks would quickly join mainstream america kkk put an end to that dream just saying again and again that there is a gap does not acknowledge the reality ask a bona fide teacher when black youth knows schooling will be rewarded education will command respect wallace f smith walnut creek c

chuck chuck palahniuk wrote a book and it did s ck july today the reader from harrisburg finished chuck s novel diary the novel that never really convinced him was a diary as it never stooped to that convention of writing in the first person he read the awkward switching from third person to second person in chuck s novel your novel chuck apparently you are in some sort of ironic writer s coma he is you are see how disconcerting this can be carried out over plus pages of his novel your novel chuck if you removed all the third tosecond person clarification prose this job drops an easy pages take out all the adipose ramblings of subcutaneous fat and musculataure which begin cute and end tedious maybe we re down to a tight novella chuck you are he is in the middle his novel picks up something resembling dramatic steam he stayed the impulse to throw the book aside half read chuck your reader the guy from harrisburg but nothing too awfully surprising happens on waytansea island he your reader just waits and sees that you have some clever almost nietzschean idea of eternal return and artistic hell did he i mean you chuck the writer of this poorly executed novel intend some statement about artistic sacrifice or did he you i mean intend just a good read because on the latter you failed and on the former you failed and about the best i can summon is that you meant well and you aren t danielle steele or that basic ilk my impression was that in picking up a palahniuk novel my first palahniuk novel his first palahniuk novel your novel chuck i d find crisp writing challenging plot developments and a refreshing even bracing worldview instead he found a tendency to repeat phrases about what you don t understand you can make mean anything and suchlike drivel why didn t he simply say what i couldn t write maybe you can just go think up and attribute to me why didn t you chuck because his characters never come alive they seem like exercises best left in notebooks your characters chuck misty peter tabbi grace harrow angel oh i can name them but ask me again in a week ask him again and he ll have forgotten them he will i will me the reader remember the reader chuck chuck that rhymes with buck that comes from movie rights to half hearted attempts to replicate the vigor of fight club caveat emptor no more will i read his novels your novels chuck even if you awake from your coma to read my diary of your diary his diary your sloppily written flimsy dreck that should only garner one amazon star but for the fact that worse writing does exist sadly when he finished your book chuck the reader from harrisburg threw it aside and took a nap the nap was good at least later he wrote a review on amazon about your book i did about your book blecch 
boring tale about flakey mean people i had to quit reading this book approximately half way through because i had no interest whatsoever in continuing to read about these snobby conceited and dull women don t waste your time 
half of the book is blank reserved for notes pages to half the book is just blank space for notes which you could just as well write in a cent page notebook spiral the beginning of the book is mostly made up of pages with simple checklists and address forms with some bulletted questions here and there 
gross quoteveryone poops is a tasteful classic quotthe holes in your nose quot is not we were given it as a gift but i put it aside after only one reading saying my kid could read it to himself once he got old enough but i didn t have to suffer through reading it aloud ever again we don t need to read about someone picking his nose and eating it ! disgusting and not worthy of being promoted alongside everyone poops as it so often is 
waste of money i m very interested in innovation and reading almost anything is out there this book is horrible disguised in an innovative format it is absolutely useless 
nazi apologist while not specifically apologizing for the nazis what this author is essentially doing is making the incredible argument that it is somehow wrong to make war on or even interfere with rogue governments engaged in crimes against humanity or serious overt aggression toward your own country and the people he is doing this at the behest of are the inheritors and old allies of the nazis communistssocialists anarchists and islamofascists these people worked together with the nazis and engage in the same behavior as the nazis more importantly part of their techniques involve a propaganda war that attempts to get people behind these sick behaviors and oppose anyone who in any way attempts to prevent such evil as genocide the terms that come to mind that describe this author include apologist collaborator traitor no matter how you slice it people like this are on the side of evil it is evil to try to manipulate people into opposing the us and the rest of the civilized world when it tries to stop countries like iraq iran syria north korea bad people do things like that because they want these countries to be allowed to do bad things bad things like blowing up your cities with nukes bad things like overthrowing your governments like is damn close to happening in france as i write this bad things like starting another world war this sort of thing is not new it happened just before world war i and later just before world war ii and it is happening now both times the major powers in the world had the opportunity to nip things in the bud both times they were tricked into not doing so the people in those democracies were tricked into worrying their governments had sinister ulterior motives for doing anything tricked into doing nothing while the world burned the result of that was millions of people dead and many millions more murdered by the fascist governments that rose to power its happening again same pattern of behavior ironically many of the same players communistssocialists anarchists and islamofascists there is a difference however the major power in the world today is the us and we are a hell of alot tougher to fool than our european friends we simply will not allow this new form of nazism to rise to power no matter what anyone says as anyone who has bothered to become educated on what actually happened in iraq as opposed to listening to communist propaganda our behavior is one of extreme restraint but overwhelming might when it is needed far from being jingoistic or militaristic the us focuses on the minimal amount of force to get the job done followed by extreme efforts to replace the twisted and evil regime of someone like hussein with an enlightened democracy that serves its people that gives them the ability to choose their own destiny in short we freed them with minimal causalties and damn few civilian deaths our intervention in iraq wiped out the funding for terrorist organizations and hussein was the primary funder of al queda and very much behind the attacks on our country and wiped a great many of these scum off the face the earth before they could harm any more people more importantly it freed millions of people from the yoke of tyranny and has given hope to millions more in the rest of the middle east that is the truth of iraq and the truth of the us we are good people who do good things in the world and we will not stand idle in the face of evil especially if you are stupid enough to bring it to our shores people like lieven are something else something sinister think twice before getting behind his lies because the person he wants to hurt is you
