superb bardem galvanizes painterly look at reinaldo arenas spanish born actor javier bardem gives a staggering performance as cuban poet reinaldo arenas which is lucky since he is in almost every frame of this film in fact he is the only constant in a biopic that sometimes feels disjointed and a bit long winded piecing together as it does the various episodes of arenas life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow in the process at the same time this is a powerfully moving film that displays the intensity of the post revolution persecution experienced by cubans more effectively than either carlos eire s memoir waiting for snow in havana or hollywood confections such as sydney pollack s havana or richard lester s cubadirector julian schnabel an artist himself who had previously directed a film about celebrity graffiti artist jean michael basquiat jumps back and forth like an abstract painter clarifying time periods by employing captions we first see arenas birth in rural cuba followed by glimpses of his poverty stricken childhood the story then moves forward to just before castro rose to power and when arenas becomes a revolutionary living in eastern cuba by as both an open gay and an intellectual arenas writings have made him anathema to castro s regime for the next fifteen years he shuttles back and forth between jail and freedom and arenas story sheds much light on the difficult of living as a member of not just one but two minorities in highly visual terms schnabel creates a striking tableau of life in cuba that shows how getting out of cuba was not an easy decision for natives to make and arenas like most cubans makes it only begrudgingly at first imagine having to give up everything and fleeing there is a vividly filmed sequence of an all night party in an abandoned convent that houses a homemade hot air balloon shades of jules verne by which one of them decides to escape selfishly and fatally there are also some powerful scenes that show the humiliating torture arenas experienced in prison ending finally with his escape and ultimately his departure from cuba in the mariel harbor exodus of as one of castro s undesirables arenas then went into exile in new york living with his former lover lazaro sadly soon after his arrival in america he became ill with aids the american sequence is short allowing maximum time for the cuba ordeal that makes up most of the film the charismatic bardem is superb capturing the emotional combustion in his character s life there are a few guest appearances that somewhat undermine the story s realism a nearly unrecognizable turn by sean penn as a cuban peasant and in dual roles johnny depp as a sadistic closeted lieutenant and a transvestite named bon bon who entertains prisoners in el moro prison and the use of english versus spanish seems to be more at the director s discretion than the actual circumstances within scenes but these are forgivable indulgences since schnabel has made a valuable film telling a tale of cuban struggle and hardship of a type that we surprisingly don t see that often in film at minutes it does seem a bit overlong but arenas packed a full life in his years most importantly schnabel successfully paints a picture depicting the influences behind arenas writing his difficult childhood his conflicted feelings for his mother coming to terms with his sexuality the revolution in cuba and the pain of being an outcast in his own country as one might expect from a painter schnabel uses images as effectively as words to advance the story most are simple and quite beautiful such as an early scene of a rainstorm that turns into a raging torrent of water a later shot of countless prison inmates dangling bars of soap outside of their jail cells or flashes of snow falling in new york as arenas and his friend lie on a speeding convertible nevertheless because arenas as a writer dealt in words it is impossible to tell his story without embracing this component and bardem s economical voiceovers attest to that aspect in a dramatically effective manner strongly recommended in spite of the relatively minor flaws the dvd also includes an interesting french television interview with the real arenas from

cinderella rocks we ve seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays 
be afraid be very afraid seth brundle goldblum is a scientist who might just have invented the world s first teleporter the only bug pun intended is the fact that it doesn t handle flesh and live teleportations ronnie geena davis is a writer for particle magazine and will stay by his side documenting via video his attempts to break through upon successfully teleporting a baboon seth gets cocky and decides to try and teleport himself a fly slips into the pod while he teleports at first seth finds newfound strength and agility but pretty soon he s changing for the worst this is one of cronenberg s best films masterfully directed and executed it s also jeff goldblum s finest performance to date ! not content on doing a mere remake the original fly is a much different film starring vincent price cronenberg brings this film to the next level literally it s filled with deep human drama and let s not forget the award winning special effects ! top notch effects contribute in putting this film ahead of the pack of other mid eighties sci fihorror flicks the film overall has aged well its already been twenty years if not for the eighties fashion statements im having a hard time figuring out which it is more a sci fi or a horror film i guess it s a fusion of both i gotta stop these bad puns whether you see it for the first time or revisit it cronenberg s the fly is a great gory character driven profoundly human film the second disc is chock full of special features various documentaries and a making of screenplays the original short story on which the original film is based trailers for all the fly movies ever made deleted scenes and much much more a must have for any cronenberg fan 
smart funny scary show veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television although the show has been focusing more on veronica s romantic relationship than in the past the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show the acting for the most part is top notch and kristen bell who plays veronica is amazing i especially enjoyed episode spit and eggs in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus 
daniel boone ken tuck e it was great fun to watch this with our sons ! this was the pilot episode for the series starring fess parker we would like to purchase all of the episodes for the years the series ran but have only found this one episode available so far we would like to see these available on dvd 
the total remake of the private war of major benson dear reader it is true i was in training to be a film maker of some portent yes i was properly versed in the international film art scene avante garde and film noir i have been exposed to potemkin hundred blows the bicycle thief day for night etc but again let me indulge you in another one of my film guilty pleasures major payne yes it is a remake of the private war of major benson but it s as opposite as the two kirks in tos mirror mirror the movie definetely has a feel of gosh golly and swell although good for it s time it generally has the sickly sweet feeling thoughout major payne takes a completely degree turn thats right the major damon wayans is not a boisterous chauvanistic drunk no siree bob ! major winifred benson payne is a killing machine out of his own platoon he not only captures the head bad guy but the bad guy s entire army ! when one of his platoon mates is shot in the leg the major has a very sick solution to getting your mind off a that pain this major is a human terminator great example is his story telling version of the little train that could i would go into detail but i won t as the children reading this may acquire horribly scarred pysche sthe children in the movie are not the cute innocent gum chewers of but can be equally venomous and dangerous as the major as seen in their exploits of getting rid of the major cmon what kinda of kid tries to photograph a boy dressed up as a girl pretending to be sleeping with their rotc instructor pretty demented kids yes this movie goes way overboard on the major s character live ammo on the training grounds and the children s character payola to the local town motorcycle gang leader but at least it has the guts to come forth and tell us just how hard it is to teach today s kids but seriously folks let your hair down and have a good hard laugh check out major payne ps seeing the partial parody of apocolypse now at the beginning well worth seeing this movie vulcan 
best series out there best series out there on any sci fi show makes you think and imagine the worlds out there in the universe this is a good after thought of star trek 
movie it was a very unusual movie i was a bit confused about their relationship but i was entertained enough to watch the whole thing 
great flick for bollywood enthusiasts i ve seen many bollywood films and for that reason i was intrigued by the controversy sparked by the entire deepa mehta trilogy fire earth and water after having seen all three movies i can honestly say that earth was by far the best of the three the acting was superb and the story was so much more tragic and heart wrenching than the other two films 
this robin hood is unforgetable for years i ve enjoyed watching this movie i recently joined the disney movie club and picked this movie up for my year old son to watch and of course he loved it and as i watched him watching it it reminded me of the first time i watched it this movie was was made in the early s when disney wasn t turning out a lot of animated movie besides this movie and the rescuers disney didn t have a lot going on in the animation department but they put out some great live action films the cast for this movie is exceptional especially phil harris who puts the voice to little john if his voice sounds familiar it s because harris also voiced baloo in the jungle book and thomas o malley in the aristocats some would critisize disney by using harris again they would say little john and baloo are essentially the same character and my response it so what baloo is a great character and little john just makes harris look that much better the story is flowing and funny my favorite part of the film has to be the music it so great and contagious that i can t help but sing the songs hours after the movie is over so pick this one up and enjoy this disney classic with the whole family my one regret is that it doesn t have a special edition version maybe disney will do that soon 
mi vida loca great movie definately original and something many chicanos living is socal can relate to or be familiar with 
the mission i saw this video years ago but i still remember it as being very exciting and action filled with superb acting i think it is one of the best action adventure film ever made and it was shot on location the photography was stunning 
what movie did the other reviewers watch luchino visconti is a master of the epic however his epic style always takes place within a family and always leads downward towards an inevitable doom his movies tends to remind us of the godfather but visconti dare i say even gets closer to the marrow of the issues than coppola does at his best i am nevertheless a big fan of the godfather to visconti the finest details of a film are of the utmost importance you can watch a film like rocco or the leopard several times and still miss things visconti s cinema is one which reveals itself in every character in every piece of furniture in every moment rocco and his brothers is if not my favorite italian film certainly one of the top ten to see the brilliant camera work of giussepe rotuno combined with visconti at his peak is simply magnificent the film itself is extremely radical in structure slowly revealing itself focusing sometimes on what appear to be small conversations but everything is woven to make a perfect whole wherein the seams are all neat and though at times are barely hanging together it always holds as if there is some greater purpose in mind visconti reveals much about both the family and their society one could be bold and comment that the whole film is about fighting to survive sometimes fighting one another life sometimes is like a boxing match but the match is sometimes not the one you choose to fight you are thrown into it and some of the factors working for or against you are money pride love and family 
great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch 
one of allen s masterpieces a comedy with a bitter sweet edge the purple rose of cario has a fairly simple premise cecilia mia farrow struggles to make ends meet during the great depression her husband monk danny aiello is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent the only escape that cecilia has is going to the movies the fantasy world of hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world her favorite movie the purple rose of cario featuring gil shepard jeff daniels as tom baxter also jeff daniels in a dual role changes her life when the character tom baxter walks out of the movie into the real world he says he s in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except cecilia s sister cares about the rest of the characters in the film edward herrman milo o shea deboarh rush zoe caldwell john wood van johnson are pretty upset and end up sparing with the audience watching them on screen when they complain how boring the movie is purple rose is one of allen s most complete films and captures all the wistfulness that lurks in the background of his films this dvd looks extremely good considering that the transfer is from there s some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly on screen but on the whole it s not a big deal allen hasn t done commentary tracks are allowed extras on his releases which is too bad as there s cut footage of viggo mortensen and michael keaton who was originally cast in the lead instead of daniels that would be of interest i don t know if that footage still exists but if it did it would make a lovely addition to this why mgm didn t choose to include archieved footage of allen talking about the film and new interviews with the stars is beyond me this oscar nominated for best screenplay film certainly deserves a documentary on its making or at the very least a featurette we do get the original theatrical trailer and a booklet that discusses the making of the film a great movie that will hopefully get better treatment when it ends up on the blu ray format purple rose is still a treat and well worth picking up it s also priced well at at most retail outlets and at amazon com 
first blood crossed with the fugitive it s not hard to see how this movie got made a director known for gritty streetwise thrillers the french connection about a soldier who was trained to kill but now can t turn it off due to battle scarring first blood anyone starring tommy lee jones reprising his role in the fugitive but with a twist tommy lee jones is just the right casting for the role of the tracker a man whose father was a soldier but trained his son how to kill and survive in the wilderness be stealthy in order that he would never have to kill now one of his proteges has gone rogue and tlj is brought out of retirement to track him down meeting along the way the fbi agent played by connie nielsen the concept is a good one if unoriginal the idea of the tracker is fascinating and as the extras on the dvd show not without basis in fact but the execution is a mixed bag on the plus side the knife fighting scenes have a gritty fast moving realism to them that has rarely been seen this is one of the movies big attractions on the minus side the movie feels like it has been chopped up and pieces gone missing even the deleted scenes only give a hint to some of the directions the movie was going there is a cynicism about americas military here similar to friedkins last movie rules of engagement but whatever message comes along with that has thinned out along the way the roles the actors play do not leave the actors room to flesh out and inhabit their characters connie nielsen does her best which is pretty darn good in a woefully underwritten role which seems in the end to serve little useful purpose on the whole though this is an edge of the seat chase movie set in breathtaking if chilly scenery in oregon and british columbia and should not disappoint just dont expect to remember much about it in a month or two and a half stars ! i rounded up to for the great fight choreagraphy 
a magical film about friendship in a terrible time louis malle one of the best directors to ever create film gained his reputation through a series of semi autobiographical films films so heart felt so deeply emotional so full of detail they can t be anything but outstanding au revoir les enfants recently released on dvd by the criterion collection is my favorite of these films julien gaspard manesse has a deep felt affection for his mother see malle s murmur of the heart for more on this but he understands he will be much safer at the french boarding school in the countryside the school run by priests provides a safe haven for the children of well off families during world war ii returning from christmas break the new year is uneventful for a while julien is a bright student and the ring leader for a bunch of boys julien trades items with joseph a poor boy who works in the kitchen more out of amusement than anything else but also to supplement the meager diet served by the priests one day a new student arrives jean bonnet raphael fejto a quiet boy the other kids make fun of look at easter bonnet julien also begins to notice things about the new kid he doesn t participate in the catholic prayers the father s lead he doesn t eat certain things and one night julien wakes up to find jean praying over some candles then julien s attitude changes and he forms an uneasy friendship with jean made in more than forty years after the events depicted julien is a thinly disguised autobiographical version of the director as he lives a real life event from malle s childhood you might expect such a film to be filled with saccharin and sugar full of fond reminiscences from his childhood but the film is very astute at depicting the childhood as an observer might see it we watch julien observe things react to things but he is very adult for his age giving us an adult view of the events because we are watching his reactions we see his feelings which are emotional but reserved it is similar to a television show with a laugh track the fake laughter cueing us to laugh when the television show doesn t have a laugh track they have to work harder to make us laugh when we are watching the events unfold through julien s eyes malle has to work harder to make adults feel for the characters because this works every emotion is more resonant and the film is much more powerful life in the school is depicted in such a vivid fashion it instantly becomes clear someone really lived through this period this tale is autobiographical the boys live in an old monastery with very little heat yet they don t seem to notice the problem much they have endured it for so long and have become used to it playing outside in the frigid weather wearing shorts and coats the classes are also very different from what we are used to today the teachers are strict and the children tend to learn despite the circumstances of their life even though these children are from rich families living in this boarding school and they are well cared for they still have worries the war is ever present some of the students have lost brothers father uncles and more they are better off than many of their countrymen but that doesn t mean they are comfortable as the relationship between julien and jean grows and changes their friendship becomes deeper julien is like most boys his age anytime someone new enters the picture they have to prove they can fit in jean doesn t really fit in or for that matter really try to yet every time julien is surrounded by a group of friends jean seems to long for the same camaraderie he is better in most subjects than jean and he seems to get the preferential treatment julien once received but as julien realizes jean is different and begins to piece together why he realizes jean will never completely fit in and has to help him through this ordeal they become friends thankfully malle also shows a lot of restraint in this area the friendship is a gradual thing it doesn t happen immediately or completely taking time to develop because the film is set in the winter of the threat of german soldiers is constant these soldiers have occupied the small town changing everything about the people s lives yet malle doesn t paint them as the completely evil men we have come to associate with hitler s persona yes there is always a threat but some of their human qualities are displayed when julien and jean get lost in the forest german soldiers find them and return them to the school one of the teachers makes a remark about the filthy german soldiers the soldier responds he would like the blanket the filthy germans used to keep the children warm during the ride back during a parent visit julien s mother visits and takes them to a restaurant at the restaurant a french collaborator gives a jewish customer a hard time a table of german soldiers notices this and chastises the french collaborator humiliating him leaving the jewish customer to reflect in silence the german soldiers acted out of irritation at having their dinner interrupted but it is interesting to watch them take the frustration out on the right person it would have been extremely easy to paint the german soldiers as the villains we know they were this story is told through julien s eyes and at the time he wouldn t have known the full extent of the atrocities inflicted by the german army therefore malle makes some of these men seem human giving the entire film another layer of depth also during the final moments when the gestapo arrives at the school to investigate claims of jewish students their leader seems to be fairly kind and nurturing even towards the jewish students he uncovers of course this makes him all the more monstrous we don t expect him to take one of the children and start reading him a bedtime story we know the fate of these children and it is chilling we don t really need to know what happened to them but when malle provides voice over narrating what happened to jean and the other jewish students hiding in the boarding school we learn their fate and it causes great sadness all of these different layers help to make the story seem more realistic the boarding school is run by pere jean philippe morier genoud a strict missionary who puts up with little foolishness but after jean s arrival julien witnesses a different side of the headmaster the fact that this catholic priest would help jewish children hide in his boarding school putting him and the school at risk is a truly courageous thing this is yet another layer another detail giving the film great depth because no one is completely innocent or completely bad everyone is involved in the tale of wartime survival au revoir les enfants is a heartfelt masterful film everyone should witness for themselves description doesn t do it justice malle also worked in american film creating some interesting stories the best of which is atlantic city starring burt lancaster and susan sarandon in an early role if you haven t experienced the work of louis malle now is the time elevator to the gallows an early malle film was also just released by criterion check it out 
i figured it out i think this girl is really on drugs not sleeping right not eating paranoid seeing shadow people always itching her nose and itching her arm she is seen in one scene where she s ironing and the iron isn t even plugged in last scene of movie you see some kind of powder on the ground yup this girl was just a speed freak that just lost her mind watch it though it is still a good flick 
sleeper movie will wake you into shuddering dread minutes is a horrifying and gritty peek into the injustice of the american legal system and also the news media wow two digs in one film how can you resist emil slovak a czech national played by karel rodan and his friend oleg razgul a russian national played by oleg taktarov who met in prague decide to travel to america the land of opportunity emil wants to hunt down his old crime partner who took all the money from the robbery he was jailed for but oleg is infatuated with american cinema and wants be a filmmaker immediately upon arriving oleg steals a video camera from a store and they are off to confront emil s old partner and get their money back but while oleg films the event emil discovers that his portion of the money was already spent and he kills his friend and friend s wife unfortunately there was someone else watching the murder daphne handlova had been staying with her friends and fled the apartment after witnessing the murders an illegal alien herself she does not want for the police or the killers to find her but leaves her purse behind in the apartment where emil discovers who she is the apartment is burned to cover the bodies a bohemian barbeque says oleg which calls in not only successful homicide detective eddie flemming robert de niro but fire marshal jordy warsaw edward burns to the scene emil and oleg get away but while emil obsesses with finding daphne oleg obsesses about filming their trip to america killings and all he believes he is making the greatest movie ever they begin to watch new york s hot and exploitive news show called top story anchored by shady newsman reporter robert hawkins played expertly by kelsey grammer these three men flemming warsaw and hawkins become irresistible targets to emil and oleg the two eastern european psychopaths believing that controlling and taunting these famous men will give them the recognition they desire i don t want to give away too much of the plot but suffice to say that there is a brutal murder scene where flemming showcases just how tough a cop he is and hawkins will reveal himself as slimiest snake in the media industry and emil will learn enough to know that insanity can set him free even if he is caught there is action from beginning to end in this movie a tight and somewhat confusing plot at times some great acting from both the stars and the supporting cast including a great character played by david alan grier there is seediness and wretchedness and hopelessness and an ending that makes the film come together quite nicely if you are ready for a little brutal cop action in your life give minutes a try enjoy ! 
one of my favorites i love this movie and i m so glad it s coming to dvd this movie is absolutely a must see for anyone who ever wondered what happened to my life where did i go 
rich in metaphor hard to categorize like del toro s pans labyrinth which has made huge waves in the non hollywood world the devil s backbone is not easily categorised ghost story yes but much more picture of the scary tensions in spain in the early days of the civil war yes but more wonderful tale of how a group of children mature amid disaster and tragedy and come to be almost their own family to replace the ones they never had or are separated from yes but more rich in symbols and allegory yes but the richness of what t seliot called the objective correlative gives one that sense of underlying depth for instance there s the huge unexploded bomb stuck in the middle of the school courtyard what is it but a metaphor for the hidden ghastly secret that waits to explode and reveal the reason for the mysterious ghost of the boy santi we only find out santi s story near the end then there s the devil s backbone itself in reality a congenital deformity where the spine is exposed but spooky looking in the sample floating in a jar of preservative doesn t jacinto exactly match that name an irredeemable core of evil like a shakespeare villain or the captain in pan s labyrinth del toro doesn t want to claim that there s something good in everyone he says no some characters are just irreversibly turned to the dark side the very backbone of evil then there s the subtle end to end connections that add more richness in the early scene of the school classroom the children are shown the picture of a mammoth and the teacher makes the point that in these days the creatures were so big and strong that the hunters could only succeed by working closely together as a group at the end the children that have survived do exactly that as they hunt the gunman and with pointed wooden spears yet i don t really agree with the reviewers who see a strong parallel to the lord of the flies the children here wonderfully acted by the way don t regress to a primitive kind of anarchical ritual filled state in fact they bond ever more closely and deal very directly with the real world around them one thought having seen this i now don t think any more that in pan s labyrinth we are absolutely definitely meant to take ofelia s fantasy scenes as all in her mind clearly del toro doesn t mind creating real supernatural entities perhaps in pan he just wants to leave us in a state of permanent uncertainty though the majority view among reviewers is that it s literally just fantasy

excellent period drama the house of eliott is an excellent british series about two sisters suddenly left penniless in postwar england to make ends meet they take in sewing and eventually open a dress shop the two sisters are very good friends with the older sister bea being the more practical sister and the younger sister evie more impulsive and kind hearted i liked the series a great deal the costumes historic detail and characters are wonderful at times i found myself annoyed by evie who i thought was occasionally inconsiderate and selfish but that s what makes great characters they are memorable and flawed i also didn t care for the suffragette character who was a bit harsh in her judgement of her fellow man sometimes listening to her scolding other characters for their selfish ways ruined the mood at least for me while i concede poverty and inequity are serious issues having her bray about it bored me stars excellent 
teacher s review by far this version of julius caesar is the best marlon brando is outstanding in his portrayal of marc antony note his dogs of war speech as well as his eulogy of caesar and use of verbal irony also of note is sir john gielguld and his portrayal of cassius this film really brought to life this wonderful shakesperian play for my th graders although they were bummed out that it was in b w 
great opening sequence with drew barrymore i ll keep this review short scream is probably one of the best teen slasher films to come from the s forget urban legends and i know what you did last whatever this is probably the only good one the story was original and refreshing it was written by kevin williamson and directed by wes craven the film cleverly poked fun at the horror genre and made interesting observations like the characters not turning around when the killer is right behind them the film also reffrences alot of other horror films like halloween the howling ect anyways the film was brilliant but its to bad the sequals sucked and wes craven couldn t make a decent or good film after this what the hell was he thinking when he did cursed and red eye 
one of the great westerns this peckinpah masterwork is a breath of fresh air after the stifling conventions of s western genre this film is modern in every sense with its downbeat view of heroism and challenging of western conventions the story of two aging gunfighters is filled with interesting characters and situations the real secret to its charm is the telling attention to little details in the characters the marriage scene is an especially memorable set piecethis is peckinpah s finest film told with real warmth and restraint there is real depth here that may suprise people who have only seen his later films the musical score and a couple of studio shot scenes are the only thing that really date it beautifully shot and masterfully directed with a haunting closing shot 
the most original screenplay since brazil which was the most original screenplay since citizen kane at least that s my take how do i describe this movie i can t it s bizarre in the extreme but i mean that in a good way it s like nothing you ve ever seen before it takes screenwriting to a new level maybe that sounds a tad pretentious but sorry it s true i can t imagine how they sold it to the suits i mean i can t even imagine how the script reads how one can make sense of it on paper but i m glad someone did because the result was a stunningly original film but how do i describe it i can tim not the only one with this problem i read the back of the box in the video store it made no sense i read some capsule summaries on the internet movie database they made no sense either it s very stream ofconscious proceeds more by gut instinct than by logic basically but not entirely i heart huckabees is a philosophical discourse where the various existential elements are personified and characterized and these existential elements get into arguments with each other if you re the type of person who thinks matters of importance through only to have your own brain argue with itself to hear little voices competing for your psyche s attention then you ll understand this movie if you aren t that type of person you may find yourself like many roger ebert james berardinelli feeling on the outside frustrated that you can t crack the code and get into this movie from the first frame i had no trouble identifyinjg with these extremely strange situations but many will and it s understandable i ll skip all the obvious jokes about how maybe the right drugs will help this movie is like a drug and you may have a bad reaction to it or not but how do i describe it i can t just rent it the performances are a joy except maybe oddly for dustin hoffman who never really seems to find a unique voice to match his unique haircut paired with lily tomlin she blows him off the screen seemingly without trying jason schwartzman and mark wahlberg are wonderful as the screwball main protagonists schwartzman in particular shines in this sort of offbeat role isabelle huppert made me laugh just by her what isshedoinghere presence but i couldn t tell you why ditto naomi watts you can read all the reviews you want of this film but they won t do it justice you ll either hate it or it will blow your mind ebert didn t like it but he didn t like brazil either and for many the same reasons for him neither film made sense for me they come from deep within our psyches and owe more to the irrational than to anything in the neocortex how well you respond to either might be determined by your imagination how far it can go how many different ways you can see something but how do i describe it i can tgo see it 
after the fox i am a huge peter sellers fan and this stands out in some ways as one of his greatest performances who else could as an englishman play the role of an italian who in one scene disguises himself as an american tourist and speaks fake english buy this and have a good laugh

jet li my favourite movie yet of all the movies i have seen jet li in this one is my favourite dont get me wrong i have enjoyed jets movies a lot but i put this the top of my list hired as an assassin which you know full well he would not hurt a fly let alone kill eric tsang takes him under his wing only things dont go as planned however there are long action scenes where jet gets to show us some excellent fighting comedy scenes and an good story to go with all of this i must add that i did not think i would enjoy it much but i proved myself wrong and i am glad that i did 
send in the clowns plot three brothers casey nathan forrest winters geoffrey brian mchugh and randy sam rockwell are left on their own when their parents leave town for the weekend they decide to visit the local carnival circus even though casey is terrified of clowns and boy is this a bad night to choose ! three anonymous mental patients michael jerome west who is credited as tree bryan weible and david reinecker have escaped and run away to the circus ! after the show is over the real clowns known as cheezo timothy enos bippo frank damiani and dippo karl heinz deuber are slaughtered by the inmates who steal their clothes and makeup for a creepy disguise then again they do seem quite delightfully mad so maybe they actually think they are clowns they eventually find their way to the house of the three brothers and once they realize the residents are home they decide to have a little fun of course to the brothers this will be nothing less than a night of terror ! the inmates for reasons unknown seem to love a good kill and tonight they re gonna give these boys a whole house full of horrific surprises clowns have always been an interest of mine and lately i ve become even more interested so as a horror buff i figured clownhouse had to be the perfect flick for my evilly kooky taste well while there are a few parts of the film that are certainly less than genius i was quite impressed most b movies have to take themselves lightly or they will be a wreck but there are a few of them that try to be full on horror and suspense and accomplish their goal clownhouse wasn t particularly scary to me but i thought for it s lack of comedic approach that it was executed very well the acting isn t all that great but it s not too distracting either once the psycho clowns start doing their business you forget all about any underlying flaws i think the atmosphere was what this was all about not to mention the fact that it was mostly believable almost every scene took a fairly realistic approach to the story this sometimes causes a little boredom here and there but for the most part makes the movie much more entertaining the score often an eerie big topish tune calliope style or with a music box was definitely a pleasant surprise especially the theme which can be heard in its entirety at the end credits and whether you re rooting for the clowns or the brothers there are plenty of good scenes and a few creepy moments to satisfy the viewer the concept alone is a good enough reason to see this but i think salva pushed it to the limit and came out with an enjoyable film for any horror fan to own overall i don t really think i have any complaints for a blockbuster hit this would ve been a bit of a disappointment but for a rarely known b flick i ve got to give it two thumbs way up there aren t any special features besides the theatrical trailer but who needs em 
a reader flipping through cable stations late one night i came across a bearded alan bates intellectually and poetically analogizing a fig to the female part before a party of mesmerized and embarrassed picnickers i too was mesmerized especially by the quiet deep limpid restraint of the scene the little subtle expressions on the faces of the main characters revealing their fundamental natures bates s clear precise voice his deadly serious playfulness the rich green english countryside etc oliver reed s reaction to the monologue was especially impressive for its understated humor and intelligence i was not able to finish the film but what i had seen of it stayed with me in an uncannily powerful way and lo and behold within a week i had discovered the dvd version at borders of all places i have since watched it completely and in part dozens of times it is along with the enormous brideshead revisited the best adaptation of a novel i have ever seen and a d h lawrence novel at that ! i d have thought it impossible but these fellows pull it off and then some 
return to easter beagle go back in time to when you were younger and watched snoopy on television it s just that great to see the charlie brown gang waiting and preparing for the arrival of the easter beagle and now i can share that experience with my grandchildren thank you easter beagle happy easter 
truffaut s mad composition this film is based on the life of adele hugo from her diary part of which was discovered in a historical library pierpont morgan library in new york city inspired and based on the book le jounal d adele hugo and a biography truffaut read by frances vernor guille i anticipated seeing a kind and gentle french film when first sitting down to view this instead this beautiful creature appears on the screen adjani and begins to bare her soul with the intensity of a fire breathing dragon as truffaut said her story is the autopsy of a passion as the only surviving daughter of victor hugo the famous author adele was sharing his exile in the channel islands during the reign of louis napoleon when she met the english lieutenant pinson with whom she had a brief affair when pinson was transferred to nova scotia she followed him the film begins with her arrival in halifax in with that said i think this film becomes a deep psychological drama as this apparently rational well educated perceptive character indulges herself with irrational behavior in an attempt to obtain love from someone who does not want it clearly it is her feelings towards him that matter to her not him this is a story of a women who is destroyed by a man who is indifferent to her yet throughout the film you don t condemn or pity her she remains a heroine as a representation of a kind of archetype adele s fixation transcends amorous feeling the male version of this which has been dealt with in a number of films womanizer types focuses on physical conquest what could be had or taken the female emphasis or version of this is on romanticised attainnment or loss truffaut has found a perfect metaphor in adele for this neurosis and unlike other films which carry this theme made later such as fatal attraction he is not inclined to put this character in a strait jacket or have her blown away no moral judgement is made the stylized direction from truffaut and cinematography shot by nestor almendros give this film a poetic quality dark on dark with the sky rarely visible and the characters clearly focused the emphazises is on emotion isabelle adjani performance in this film as noted by many is first rate a veteren actress by this time having first appeared on the screen at age she seems to intuitively know and understand the part of adele truffaut should get the credit here for staying true to the story and bringing her performance to light while at the same time keeping the theme intact throughout truffaut stated the story of adele h which might be compared to a musical composition for a solo instrument requires no preliminary explanations suffice it to say since i am obviously incapable of making films against i keep on filming for triviaisabelle adjani was only when this film was made much younger than the women she played there are photographs seen in this film of victor hugo s actual funeral procession when he died at age he was buried like a divinity with a procession of over million mourners daughter adele victor hugo s wife adele died in was not among them she spent the last odd years of her life in a asylum writing in her journal in code pauline kael wrote victor hugo is said to have had no equal as a poseur and a mythmaker but on truffaut s evidence his daughter who lived to eighty five burning with faith to the end may have surpassed him 
great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch 
mostly a great artist it s a common fact that great artists often make poor human beings unable to connect with real life in a decent way it was certainly the case with pablo picasso and we knew that before this movie was made the film seems to say that he only loved women for the sake of his art being spanish he was a latin man with a deep inclinaison towards his own ego his control over the people he knew really destroy them in many ways while it is a work of fiction the performances keeps it interesting even if we don t have to take it all too seriously

it s jimmy carr need more be said thanks for keeping a brit sane in a country full of my wife says jokes your wife is fat and ugly and i don t care what she says because she s ugly and fat and not my wife 
genius putting it simply this film is the work of a genius as a tom stoppard fanatic i adored it from the moment i read the play which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with he was significantly more satisfied with the movie and there is very little doubt as to why he clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film they may or may not like it but that s not what matters this film is amazing 
still burning at the end although lenny was near the end when this performance was filmed he still puts on a riveting show he does go on about the legal system a lot but what he says makes so much sense you almost wish he could have used something like this in some of his courtroom defenses he always said the prosecutors would do a bad lenny bruce in court ! for people who assume he was constantly harrased and busted for his foul language get a hold of this film and see how brilliant he was 
still holds up great i saw this back when it was released in the s i liked it thn and i like it now it is a poignant story that still has merits today new york looks awfully gritty too just like ti did in the s edward g robinson s death scene is particularly moving being that this was his last movie it makes it even more so good cast too the late edward g robinson the late chuck connors the late brock peters the last joseph cotten in a small part and of course the s sci fi man himself charlton heston robert t 
must see womens picture i really miss the genre loosely called womens pictures that combined wonderfully lurid storylines with laugh inducing hays code cleaned up dialog and major major fashion unfortunately nowadays the closest we get is the really crude sex and the city whose scripts leave nothing to the imagination and where the fashion comes direct from walmart the best of everything scores major points for a great looking cast dynamite clothes and wonderfully trashy storylines if this isn t the ultimate popcorn movie what is ladies invite your friends over rustle up some major munchies fire up this dvd and have a whale of a good time !

great carrier and battle action a real great action movie about the navy and its planes and pilots not all factual but still a great movi 
odd story both visually audibly entertaining here s an extremely stylish different film panned by almost all the professional critics which means here s another example of why they should be ignored you are better off reading the reviews of people here at amazon being one who appreciates stylish film making i thoroughly enjoyed the images and the sound on this movie i found it absolutely fascinating being a male it doesn t hurt that ashley judd stars in it either to be fair i can see where the story would turn off a number of people the co lead ewan mcgregory s character is odd and not very credible k d lang s character is unlikable there is some stupid numerology as part of the story and the ending is unsatisfying yet despite the above the story is very involving and the visuals and sound surround are just so good that they way outweigh the negatives the movie flat out entertains which is the name of the game 
last tango in paris love that era of movies acting was grea 
fantastic drama of science fiction slaughterhousefive minutes is a classic drama of science fiction directed by george roy hill from the script of stephen geller that was based on the masterpiece of the north american writer kurt vonnegut jr the film shows the attempt of an american former soldier that fought in the second world war and that witnessed the bombing of the city of dresden to write his experience of the war billy pilgrim the actor michael sacks the protagonist is a citizen who travels in time goes to the tralfamadore planet where he makes contact with aliens and revisits diverse moments of his own life in the past in the present and in the future the crucial point of his existence is the episode where he was made prisoner during the second war when he lived the bombing of the german city in which had died thousand people the double of deaths of hiroshima the narrative is marvellous fantastic sarcastic funny satirical ironic sad overwhelming and full of sense 
perfect until the sickness begins the secret lives of dentists is an interesting low key and mature film about the life of a dentist it s odd and that oddness makes it perfect until halfway into the movie which i ll get too it s got a great cast that features campbell scott the dying gaul hope davis the weather man robin tunney tvs prison break and denis leary jesus son scott davis leary deliver some of the best performances of their career without even trying scott plays dave hurst a dentist who seems to have a perfect life he s got a thriving dental practice that he shares with his wife dana davis he s got a nice house and three young daughters everything s perfect but then when he drops his wife of at an opera that she s in he catches her in the arms of another man trying not to think about it and succeeding for a while dave eventually begins harboring semi sexual violent fantasies that are brought on by an alter ego named slater leary who s very very good this alter ego is actually a rude patient that dave forms into his ego but it works now the first half of the movie minutes or so is perfect it captures a low key sense of real life in these minutes it s a movie you can rank with about schmidt or something like it but at about this point in the film the movie takes a different turn suddenly every character gets the flu and we spend the next minutes with a bunch of vomiting characters yes some of these scenes were fine but it lost the magic momentum that it had in that first minutes i still liked the movie and i was satisfied with the ending and even if i didn t like the movie leary is fascinating to watch tunney co stars as dave s assistant who shows up in a few of his fantasies looking very sexy at that grade b 
baseball fans will enjoy this one the curse of the grebes is sort of a tribute to the red sox return to world series glory with cameos by damon timlin and renteria timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by emily dickinson with remarkable aplomb arthur changes gears is also great he gets a bike he s been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he s so worried about getting it dirty that he won t ride it 
to the top of the world great movie loads of fun a must have for anyone collecting movies enjoy a cup of jo while you take a train trip to the top of the world 
i enjoyed this movie i cannot believe all of the negative reviewers obviously you have never had an adult party where people behave like teenagers after being delt alcohol mixed with a drug nobody has ever tried before at their age at least not here but i had a similar party and it ended similarly fights happen but not as serious you have to take things that happen at party s with open mindedness or not have them your husband or wife or girlfriend etc is not going to behave as usual and you see a bad side of them if a relationship can t handle one party like this one it probably can t survive a marriage the story kept me interested almost the whole way through except for the female gossip got alittle boring otherwise very watchable funny and tragic i would like to see it again 
i figured it out i think this girl is really on drugs not sleeping right not eating paranoid seeing shadow people always itching her nose and itching her arm she is seen in one scene where she s ironing and the iron isn t even plugged in last scene of movie you see some kind of powder on the ground yup this girl was just a speed freak that just lost her mind watch it though it is still a good flick 
set it off i have never seen such powerful female characters before each one had their own dynamic personality and tragic reason for entering a life of crime by robbing banks it is bascially non stop action and excitement but this film still makes room for a little romance between pinket and underwood 
a subtle yet powerful western michael winner s chato s land may seem a bit below standard from other films that he directed but the strength in this film comes from charles bronson s stoic performance seen and unseen on the screen bronson s presence is there and is inescapable as is the baron land he habitats the visual forsaken look of the film s characters and landscape makes the viewer wonder what the point of this whole film is whatever bronson s transgressions may really have been the forlorn posse tracking him are representative of the worst qualities of society i saw this film when first released but with time i see the deeper social implications and commentary on society that director michael winner was making this is a good western but may be a difficult one to appreciate on an initial viewing 
talk about christmas spirit i really love bones it has everything suspense drama humor pretty people fun storylines i have yet to miss an episode and even into season this is probably my favorite it adds depth to all of the characters also the winter holidays are my favorite time of year i like holidays that are about what is good in the world bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day i cry through half this episode but in a completely good way buy watch it love it but watch it with a friend if you don t want to cry alone so moving great performances by the whole cast emily deschanel was powerful in this one she brings real vulnerability to brennan here david boreanaz as always the perfect sympathetic hero loveably old fashioned cute funny moments touching poignant moments this really is the best of what is great about bones 
critics just make me laugh preachy selfimportant good grief some people just feel the need to throw insults at anything this movie was a rock solid story of a family conflicted on many different levels but love still remained togetherness still remained no matter how far apart they were physically or the depths one of them may fall what a great movie this was also the cinematography and music was outstanding capturing every moment it s a shame that some people forget about the entire scope of a film and just want to jump on the negatives you d really have to go out of your way and come up with bs like selfimportant or start jumping on the hollywood liberals to rate this any less than stars 
still a worthy effort having always loved films from the s i ve recently re discovered the delightful norma shearer i find her to be quite a good actress and found this film to be very entertaining allowing for the years since it was made it s amazing to see how single women were treated in those days as opposed to now some of it is comical where it wasn t meant to be for just that reason but norma shines through and robert montgomery her perpetual co star is quite good even though he s played this same personality in so many of her films norma shearer was called the quotqueen of mgm quot because she was married to irving thalberg but i think she d have been the success she was without him 
very touching documentary we really enjoyed every minute of this wonderful documentary i can highly recommend it 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
food for thought a previous reviewer noted that the film was basically a platform to expound on george bernard shaw s views on munitions war and other issues of the day and rated it with one star i found that shaw s social views brilliantly elucidated by robert morley in a better acting performance than many of us have ever seen him in are what make this a great film whether you agree with them or like morley s estranged screen daughter wendy hiller in the title role disagree the dialogue is fascinating the acting from morley hiller rex harrison robert newton and a youthful deborah kerr is first rate and the gritty london locales add greatly to the atmospheric ambience of the film i hope the powers thatbe favor us with a dvd version of this great film soon 
who s having a baby big fan of s music and culture and most of all the movies she s having a baby is not just a teen movie like sweet sixteen or breakfast club its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day soundtrac is great with kate bush the woman s work my girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played i told her i ll feel the same if she were the wife boy i got lovin that nite i would watch over and over again and the last credit when s famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby i thought it was clever 
love the new download i wanted it for my collection however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work 
love atlantis i think this was a great spin off from stargate sg which was starting to get stale even though i love watching it still love being able to download them all just wish they d get updated quicker honestly when i left weeks ago i saw the last episode available and i ve missed the next 
an ironic delight of a movie i first saw the movie when i was years old and was smitten immediately by its dark perverse humor and especially the performance of martha raye it is worth buying just for her performance alone a classic of comedy some of it seems a bit awkward and not smoothly done such as the speeding wheels of the train to indicate travel and time passing and some of chaplain s shticks such as the way he counts bills seem a bit gratuitous but these flaws don t do much damage to the whole one of chaplain s best if not the very best 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows

probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
great movie i actually just saw this movie recently and i have to say it s definitely my favorite christian slater flick the dialogue in this movie is incredible and it even lets you use your brain something movies don t tend to have if you re not thinking of buying this movie definitely at least check it out

teenager vs goblin king a young girl is tired of her stepmother and her new baby half brother but when she makes a comment that she wants the goblin king to take her brother it really happens she is visited by the king david bowie and learns that if she can get to his castle at the center of the labyrinth in thirteen hours she will have the chance to get her brother back she starts out and quickly learns that things are very different and that things are not fair but fair or not she needs to learn how to be unfair as well in order to penetrate the labyrinth along the way she meets strange characters and befriends a few all the while the goblin king is doing what he can to impede her traps and spells are laid and if she falls to any of them she will lose and her brother will become a goblin in the end we get a good strong message about not giving up on our dreams with a script by terry jones designs by brian froud and jim henson in charge of it all you just know this is going to be something special and unique the film starts mundanely but quickly progresses to huge amounts of puppets and fabulous effects the characters are very memorable although i felt bowie could have done without the blonde elvira wig still it have been a very rewatchable film that i have seen in the theater on video and now on widescreen dvd a fun film that is safe and appealing to almost all ages check it out 
very good movie good boy starring kevin nealon liam aiken and molly shannon animal voices by cheech marin matthew broderick delta burke donald faison brittany murphy vanessa redgrave and carl reiner this movie seemed to me like a cross between air bud e t and homeward bound the incredible journey granted there were a few scenes where i said yeah right but overall it is a warm heartfelt movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who is willing to suspend disbelief if you are the type that looks at movies from a critical point of view ie dogs don t talk dogs can t jump that high dogs can t fly etc then no you probably won t enjoy this movie i know and most other people also know that dogs don t speak english but i was still able to enjoy the movie and to those who watch with a critical eye you complain about stuff being far fetched no pun intended for this movie so i m guessing you mainly just watch movies about stuff that actually happened or could actually happen if you go to rent this movie read the back of the box first and if you can t stand the thought of a movie with talking dogs don t rent this movie and don t rent homeward bound the incredible journey or homeward bound lost in san francisco you ll be very upset with yourself to the rest of us sit back relax watch a movie and just enjoy it for what it is nevermind that it s not entirely based in reality if you are one of those people that only enjoy reality based stuff with no acting go get yourself a few documentaries at the library if you want a movie with some acting that has a basis in reality get yourself a movie like pearl harbor 
i cannot not lie about this movie it rocked this is a majestic genre defying delve into three disparate and desperate women whoopi s performance is at least as strong as her roles in jumpin jack flash fatal beauty and burglar and if you liked those films i hope you re not raising any small children or corporate management of any type anyway drew barrymore is thoroughly convincing as a trashy loose and unintelligent woman it didn t even feel like she was acting to me and parker posey looked a little differently than i remembered her but she was good as the sick girl who we all feel sorry for because she came from an abusive home maybe if she tried listening once in a while it wouldn t have been so bad 
classic romance it is a real pleasure to see the widescreen format rather than the usually shown pan scan 
fascinating ground level view of japan for the record i thought lost in translation was an extremely ok film in every way tasteful thoughtful and hey there s bill murray and panoramic views of tokyo and so forth and well like a lot of people i couldn t quite explain what it was about sofia coppola s film that bothered me and i ended up taking a swing at poor old paul thomas anderson i am not an asian film specialist nor an otaku nor deeply enamored with ozu or mizoguchi so my first impressions of love and pop are simply those of a general film afficianado read not a snob who was baited with the promise of maximum eye candy dvdbeavercom and the opportunity to make a blind purchase during a release schedule slow patch anyways imagine if you will the nooks and crannies of everyday urban japan downright attractive japanese schoolgirls scarlett who and the there youare quality of video windowboxed with immersive eavesdropping elan and voila the unlikely single disc dvd of the year so far as with lit the storyline is merely a tether for emotional scenery and the usual zeitgeist y rambling of artier fare in l p however the rambling is easier to appreciate as we aren t constantly reminded that feelings of alienation are kinda like being a white person in tokyo the cultural imposition of watching japanese catering to the whims and expectations of westerners or self consciously going against type is supremely distracting no amount of beautiful cinematography can compensate for this or for the apprehension of watching people of another culture being objectified 
a film ahead of its time it s hard to believe this film once had such an awful reputation and was considered extremely politically dangerous times have really changed for the better since this is chaplin s first full dialogue film even though the great dictator was his first sound film as is pointed out in the documentary that film seems to go back and forth between dialogue scenes and silent scenes this film was the first film he wrote expressly as a dialogue film with much less of the pantomimic scenes hearkening back to his earlier work it s also just as funny and brilliant as his earlier masterpieces we know right from the opening shot of the film what the fate of henri verdoux was since we see a grave bearing his name and the years he lived the film that follows tells us the story of just how and why he got there monsieur verdoux is a bluebeard an old fashioned slang word for a man who marries and then murders one woman after another something he never foresaw himself as for much of his adult life he worked as a successful bank clerk but then came the world depression and he lost his job society didn t seem to have any other use for him at least not anything that would enable him to make as much money as he needed to support his young son peter and his disabled wife mona i suppose this story was considered controversial in its day because monsieur verdoux is portrayed as sympathetic charming and intelligent with understandable reasons for what he s doing he s not shown as a cold blooded killer who murders these women for their money for the fun of it or because he s a sadistic monster he does what he feels he has to do because there is no other way and as we see he isn t incapable of having a change of heart such as when the young woman he was going to use as his test subject for the new poison he mixed reveals that she is in much the same situation as he is he decides to spare her and help her there are also the hilarious scenes in which he s trying and failing to murder annabella which are among the film s highlights and illustrative of why the subtitle is a comedy of murders the ending scene of the film which was the first scene chaplin shot wanting to get the hardest part out of the way first an attack on a system that rewards mass murderers and capitalist robber barons but condemns people who are driven to murder because that very system cheats them instead of celebrating them as they do people who go to war almost made me change my mind about supporting the death penalty since i share many of chaplin s political views i didn t find this film to be overly preachy or like the comedy were ruined by working in a moral and political message as well i felt it was seamlessly worked in instead of totally dominating the story and besides the reason so many people in hated this film was because it challenged what they believed and held as absolute truth and that offended them instead of listening to a different viewpoint with an open mind they chose to boycott and trash this film instead 
chato s land dvd excellent film if you think the indians were grossly mistreated by us and i do here they got some much deserved revenge and justice 
usher rocks vincent price at his best i was amazed at his interpretation of usher it was very much like the hyper sensitive fellow of poe s tale the ending was shocking i recommend this item to everybody good acting very good indeed 
rollicking western a routine but enjoyable western yarn that was pretty violent for its time the fight between george peppard and slim pickens in particular dean martin goes against type as a villain out to destroy jean peter s stage line it s up to hero george peppard and crusty old john mcintyre to set things aright which they do amid much gunfire and fisticuffs 
me and mrs jones this is a very good movie to watch and especially if you are familiar with european customs robson green is one of my favorite british actors and i tend to buy a lot of his movies when the movies are released if you like cinderella stories and maybe like to escape from reality every so often then this is the movie for you all the characters are very believeable and true to form even though something like this probably would not happen in real life its always nice to dream i recommend this movie to anybody male or female 
outstanding flick motivating too brings back the days of going through usmcrd h ll which was also some of the best days of my life now that i look back it s an absolute crime that this hasn t been officially released on dvd along with r lee ermey s boys of company c why these films have been resigned to sitting in dusty vhs out ofprint shelves while other cra py films have already been released two or three times on dvd in various special super special or ultra superspecial editions is beyond me as for the film itself if you know the drill at all get this movie you ll love it it will bring back a flood of memories most you ll cherish most will motivate and most will resonate with you long after the movie is over jack webb does an amazing performance nails the sdi perfectly can t recommend highly enough semper fi brothers 
absolutely riveting no this isn t courtney of friends but once you get past that this is must watch tv ! while the show has content that can be shocking it is so well written and edited it all fits it is definitely a sequential drama and makes much more sense watching the episodes back to back that fleshes out the characters so you start to care about and understand them courtney shows her acting chops best at those moments when she is silent and lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog is a bit stilted the best character is the functional schizophrenic photographer don konkey he is exhibits an endearing combination of weirdness loyalty insight and sweetness to become the break out star of this series if you only watched one episode and wrote this one off go back and watch a few back to back and you may just find yourself addicted 
great movie i havent seen this film in a while but its a damn good film and mesage behind it alot of people didnt know and still dont know how aids gets in your system which leaves people almost scared to be around a person as well and they all thought that you it was a gay thing only but in this film it shows that no matter what people say nothing can stop a friendship no matter what the person looks like or if they have aids and there mom tries to keep them away great fil 
if you loved the movie you will love this i really enjoyed most of the cd i would have liked some other songs to replace of the remixes of the quotdancehall queen quot track i jammed to quotlittle and cute quot quotjoy ride quot and quotmy jamaican guy quot and the track quotunbelievablequot reminded me of my husband ! all in all this was a great cd and i would buy it for a friend 
a wonderful conclusion the questions raised by the first chapter are answered i actually liked this volume better than the first it s a nailbiter humorous yet morose and i love the old kung fu movie style present in many scenes it s also more personal the bride will have her revenge 
great great great great great i loved this movie it made me cry and i am a grown man michael keaton is great in this movie you need to get this movie 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography 
first rate mystery thriller that floors you with real shocks a group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel where one by one they begin to disappear sounds familiar but promising while the promise is more than fulfilled though the familiarity is not as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist filled movies around it s astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out regarding its genuinely shocking ending i had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its dvd release ! even with advance knowledge of the outcome though it was still astounding i can only imagine how jaw dropping it must be to witness it not knowing fantastic suspense great characterization as played by a cast of well knowns including john cusack amanda peet rebecca demornay and ray liotta excellent production values and total non telegraphing of the plot combine to make identity one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time if you don t know the ending do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible the turns are some of the most unexpected ever even if you do know the gist of it don t hesitate to see it it ll still deliver many times over indispensable for fans of mystery drama horror or thrillers 
this movie helped change my life hope and a vision for recovery i knew i had a problem i finally watched this movie i had heard about this movie for a long time but never wanted to watch it but one day i did i wanted recovery like the women meg ryan played in the movie when i finally hit my bottom i knew rehab was where i needed to be because i had seen what had happened in this movie i was just like the character meg played a fun drinker then it got out of control the best was i got a vision for recovery for hope and the possibility of change in my life being painted out in my life through this movie i highly recommend now years later the miracle has come true ! my life is fabulous 
best upper body workout i have been an avid exerciser for about years it s routine for me during that time i have viewed a lot of exercise videos cory s videos are absolutely the best this upper body workout is intense but not to the point that you become dismayed and want to give up i have noticed more sculpting in my arms after just weeks and i have been doing weights for a long time there is a bit of fluff in her videos but in my opinion it just makes it more interesting and engaging the important thing is that the workout is serious and is obviously choreographed by someone who knows a great deal about fitness i highly recommend this video for a great upper body 
the earth stood still this movie moves on after so many years this movie couldn t have been written better today than it was back then a great theme ahead of it s time with a great cast i wish they could still make movies today like they did back then unfortunately most of these older movies have lost their moral meaning throughout the s s s and whatever was the s it just goes to show that just because something is new doesn t make it better watch this movie and you will know what i mean 
cold truth this is the west as i imagine it actually was rough unrefined and brutal similar in tone to days of heaven another bit of american history the claim is told in unsentimental bleak fact nobody is spared and there are no real winners except the railroad daniel dillon arrives in the wilds of northern california during the gold rush with his wife and infant daughter in hopes of making a fortune in the gold fields they arrive at a claim shack cold hungry and out of hope and are taken in by the claimer and in short order dillon unsentimentally sells his family to the lonely miner for the claim the wife elena aware that she has little say goes with her new master but does not close the door on dillon years later we find that dillon has made a go of things with his claim he has built a town called kingdom come wrested out of the mountains virtually by himself a rough andready place without amenities beyond the ubiquitous saloon and whorehouse to supply the miners a survey crew appears negotiations are begun to possibly bring the newly constructed railroad through kingdom come and establish dillon as the baron he envisions himself to be the survey crew brings with it however a nasty shock for him his erstwhile wife and now grown daughter who is unaware that dillon is her father elena the wife is dying she has come back to make some sort of arrangement with dillon as the man she was sold to has died and left her destitute and she wants to provide for her daughter the unlikely named hope dillon on seeing her realizes suddenly that his ambitions have left him hollow his closest association is the madam of the town bordello who loves him but who he has no intention of marrying he unceremoniously dumps the madam and presents elena with an offer she can t refuse and they are married despite already being married before all the townsfolk and move into a for a town like that palatial house overlooking his mountain fiefdom both hope and the madam view all this with equal suspicion and disapproval hope is aware that some connection is involved of which she is ignorant the madam is deeply angry at being shunted off like yesterday s news the survey company comes periodically into town for refreshment always greeted enthusiastically by the girls from the bordello played just right with a brittle gaiety and hope by the cast of women you can see the wavering despair of one in particular hopelessly in love with her regular customer and played to the pathos of hoping against hope that he will return each time and maybe maybe spirit her away from kingdom come some day the town itself is crude and unapologetic no church or school totally utilitarian without sidewalks or a good road dillon s hopes of the coming railroad elevating the town are clearly laid out in his efforts to sway the survey crew but his dreams of dynasty and of leaving it all to hope the daughter he abandoned and regained lie in the hands and at the mercy of the railroad company there is nothing soft or romantic about this movie it is told in real life format people make choices that are wrong or right and pay the consequences thereof there is no silver lining here frontier life was hard and nasty sometimes and this makes that very clear nothing came easy in the old west and justice was meted out unofficially and with speed there were no second chances here this movie got under my skin almost immediately it is shot in winter for one thing i was cold the whole time i watched it merely from suggestion the performances are top rate wes bentley a young man i was previously unfamiliar with plays the chief surveyist with careful consideration of his surroundings sizing up every situation hope played by sarah polley shows just the right mix of doubt and loyalty as a daughter her mother played sublimely by the legendary nastassja kinski faces her slow death bravely and accepts the life she was given daniel dillon played by peter mullan takes his role as the king of kingdom come and makes it believeable with equal parts of strength bravado and regret for mistakes made this was not a big movie i d never heard of it until i chanced on it but it was a worthwhile couple of hours insight into the life of a frontier mining town near the end of the s west and the scenery can be pretty awesome also 
good bye illusions i became interested in this movie after reading the book ishmael by daniel quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book it was a very good movie and anthony hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from ishmael there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization there was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization takers are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don t know what you are missing by being one not that all of nature has had it heck the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees but of course that was the main point of ishmael if we don t give up being takers and go back to being part of nature then nature has had it and so have we 
another entertaining warner s film from the production line g men made in was a clever response by warner brothers to the new hays code finally enforced in and which applied strict censorship on the hollywood product the challenge was to maintain the excitement of the gangster genre at the same time as honouring the new code which among other things insisted that the gangster not be glamourised the solution was to switch the magnetic jimmy cagney to the other side of the law and make the gangsters headed by the less than magnetic barton maclane much less attractive the film has a slight documentary feel as cagney enlists as a g man when he is unable to make a living as a lawyer the first section of the film follows his training and it is fairly tedious cagney is put through his paces by robert armstrong in the cliched role which pat o brien usually played cagney s sparring superior officer having honoured the code by expounding the work of the law protectors cagney is assigned to a case and the film switches to the gangsters and finally takes off there are re enactments of recorded gangland murders and the shootout in a cabin in the mountains has all the violence and excitement of the earlier pre code films ann dvorak plays a good hearted night club performer who has a yen for cagney but marries vicious barton mclane she is superb as always and performs a rather untidy but enthusiastic song and dance early in the film margaret lindsay plays the leading lady to cagney in her usual colourless way lloyd nolan plays cagney s pal who is murdered in the course of duty the film was a box office sensation in endorsed enthusiastically by the fbi and the hays office for informing the public about the prevention of crime cagney also was delighted to be playing on the right side for once the dvd print is excellent and captures the excellent lighting which gets darker as the film s plot does it is also packed with good extras there is an informative documentary about the enforcement of the production code but the excellent commentary attached to the film itself is hampered by the nasal drawl of the commentator s voice unfortunate ! there is an hilarious short film with the young bob hope which is a rare gem and the looney tune cartoon included has that great combination of music and drawings which is so entertaining also there is a short film one of a series on golf with cagney appearing without makeup he looks completely different freckle faced and tow headed finally a blooper reel is included from warners films of and a preview of devil dogs of the air a pat o briencagney teaming in cliched roles which were repeated a number of times throughout the decade whether as part of the warner s tough guys set or on its own the dvd is great value 
a kinetic ride shoot the piano player reveals the enormous amount of expressive burden and creative energy respect to well know establsihed and fixed classic references when you think in new wave terms you should consider the term demolition and a whole game of distorted images of the irreverence s mirror in all creative process there is a visible tendency to destroy the ancient patterns this fact demands from you all the possible considerations in order to enjoy and be part of this game visual metaphors gradual destruction of the classical archetype of the criminal cinematography produce by its own the final product a renovated narrative scheme and new stylistic perspectives go for this unusual film ! 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
my knees felt like jelly when the film was over cube is a very original and entertaining low budget horror film and will most likely stay with you long after you watch it what works well with cube is that we go along the ride with the characters they have no idea how they got there or what is going on we learn everything with them the acting was decent and the cgi effects were nothing special but overall the creativity makes this more than your average horror movie anyway the more i watch the film the better it gets and more ideas and meanings come to mind everytime its good too see more people are viewing cube probably because the sequels are recently being shown on tv now the sequels are pretty bad compared to the original but watch them yourself 
i love this movie i finally bought this movie ! everytime it would air on tcm my yr old daughter and i watched it s not a scary movie rather fascinating to see actual freaks of nature not hollywood actors dressed in prosthetics and makeup prince randian rocks no arms or legs yet he rolls his own cigarettes strikes a match lights up and smokes wow ! have you ever seen a real pinhead ! not the freak with pins sticking out of his face but a real pinhead this movie has 
test of time this movie is still quite fresh and very tense stands tall among the current slasher trend 
dark and light this drama is filled with possitive messages but has a darkness to it that will make you angry in a productive way 
adorable monkey business is one of the cutest movies i have ever seen and it s just so funny to see cary grant and ginger rogers take the youth serum and act like children and they were great and also the monkey were absolutely adorable this movie is recommended highly

a return to greatness for the world s best rock band i never stopped being a u fan however i did not like the direction that band was going during the popmart tour i had enough of u dressing up like the village people and coming out of giant lemons pop was a decent album with some good songs they followed it up with zooropa which had to be their worst album i understand that u was trying some type of sarcasm with the popmart tour they went away from what they do best great rock music and electric concerts i wanted to see the best live rock band in the world again u finally got it right again and released all that you can t leave behind it was a collection of great lyrics and beautiful melodies this dvd is the concert tour of this album and it s a good one as the pamphlet inside the dvd case the previous concerts were huge public arts spectacles this concert was about what a great singer bono is what an awesome guitar player the edge is this was more about their performance and connection with the crowd than it was about giant screen televisions and lemons this is a great concert it starts with a great performance of elevation that will have you jumping up and down they follow it up with beautiful day which was done brilliantly you then hear the familiar beginnings of until the end of the world as the strobe lights start flashing bono walks along the heart shaped walkway shaking people s hands this is vintage u the crowd is really into it another highlight of the concert is their classic anthem sunday bloody sunday you become glued to the screen when you hear the beginning of bad bono sounds great the band is completely on towards the end of bad bono slips part of in the music stops and the crowd is singing bono and the crowd continue to chant back and forth as this is going on we hear the familiar begining of where the streets have no name this is the highlight of the concert as the lights start flashing and the edges guitars begin to rev up bono starts running around the heart shaped walkway attached to the stage which extends into the crowd he runs faster and faster around the stage until the crowd goes into a frenzy and bono starts singing you could barely hear bono singing because the crowd is singing along so loud with him this version of the song may be the best live performance of any song that i have ever seen truly incredible performance another highlight was with or without you bono pulls a girl from the audience as he is singing they lay down flat on their backs with bono holding her as he is singing you could see the girl s lips synchronized with bono s singing along the familiar words of the song i m sure it was a thrill for her it shows bono s showmanship he knows how to command an audience great guitarwork by the edge on this one larry and adam are solid as always this dvd is excellent however it does have one flaw the constant shift in camera angles was very distracting i do not like the director s hamish hamilton mtv style editing this concert was a great one but if you really want to capture the true u experience u go home live from slane castle is a better choice the slane dvd captures the raw emotion that one feels when going to a u concert the transformation from being a spectator to an active participant of the u experience the boston dvd does have the feeling of a u concert but is a little more staged however it is a must have for any dvd collection if you re a u fan it is even more of a must have this dvd truly deserves the highest rating 
i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
john wayne and rock hudson together for the first only time i have fond memories of this film because of the way that i first happened to see it when my father was stationed in japan we would have the opportunity every couple of months to go see a late show at the base theater the movie to be screened was never announced you just went and took your chances one time it was one more time peter lawford plays lord sydney pepper and sammy davis jr was charlie salt and another time it was beneath the planet of the apes i guessed the movie on the basis of the opening shot of the waves coming ashore one night we went and the movie starts off with a bunch of confederate soldiers waiting for attack and then along comes john wayne leading a union cavalry charge and we got to see the undefeated weeks before its normal rotation to our theater actually john wayne is not the best part of this film the opening scenes deal with the end of the civil war wayne plays colonel john henry thomas whose men have followed him from texas to fight for the union and are not sick of soldiering and ready to go home the plan is that they are going to put together a herd of wild horses and sell them to representatives of the mexican government who are offering the best price of course mexico might be about to have its own civil war meanwhile the defeat of the confederacy and the arrival of northern carpetbaggers have convinced colonel james langdon rock hudson and his men that there is nothing left for them in the south so his plan is to lead his men and their families to mexico to serve in the military for the government of the emperor maximillian trying to hold onto power the two groups of former enemies meet along the way and after fighting indians together achieve something of a rapprochement mainly because rock and the duke are manly men and hit it off they two big stars acting together with rock upstaging an amiable duke at just about every opportunity the idea of what expatriate confederates during after the civil war is an interesting one but the script only deals with that as a means of setting up the rest of the film of course since the former confederates are traveling with women and the ex union soldiers only brought horses the romantic subplots involve overlooking the minor past differences of the war that killed a half million americans colonel langdon s sister inlaw marian mccargo grudgingly sparks to john henry despite the fact his unit was as shiloh where her husband was killed but it is hard to pay attention to any notion of a mature relationship when young charlotte langdon melissa newman the colonel s daughter takes an interest in blue boy la rams quarterback roman gabriel john henry s cherokee indian adopted son which does not sit well with her beau lt bubba wilkes michael vincent before he was jan michael vincent and i swear i did not make up that bubba name another nfl player a then relatively unknown merlin olsen plays corporal little george a gentle giant for gets to fight for the honor of the confederacy from time to time you will also see former miss america lee meriwether as colonel langdon s wife along with veteran character actors ben johnson as short grub harry carey jr as on of thomas riders and royal dano as a dignified confederate officer this is really a star movie it is not as good as i remember and there are all sorts of problematic elements to the film simply because the undefeated is pretty much doing things by the numbers there are no big surprises here once you know the players and it is simply a question of watching it all play out in the end i round up simply because of the scenes between wayne and hudson and that is without getting into the fascinating sub text of the personification of american machismo acting opposite the biggest hollywood star in the closet i have seen some evidence that the duke knew about rock s secret but there is nothing in the film to suggest it bothered him 
beautifully done but doesn t go deep enough purely on artistic merit i would award this film an on a scale of ten most documentaries dream of achieving this kind of artistic impression as for its command of the subject it struggles too hard to be passive in many ways that passivity is charming because it gives a chance to show what sort of person the real fred leuchter is but in turn it glances over the holocaust denial issue the portrait of fred a leuchter that comes through is a gullible and misguided man who strive to his utmost to achieve acceptance from his peers his rabid desire for acceptance is made clear by the fact that he himself pronounces his last name as if it were loocher but ernst zundel pronounces it loikter in the german sense when it comes down to the video leuchter made for zundel we find him adopting zundel s pronunciation of his own name in the end leuchter succumbs to the siren song of the holocaust deniers who bestow upon him all the respect and admiration of any university professor one feels almost sorry for such a man when his highly unpopular views ends up costing him what little success he had achieved i don t personally believe fred leuchter actually means to be the spokesperson of holocaust denial but he finds it too difficult to give up the position he has achieved through that at one point when he is asked if he could reconsider his views on the holocaust his only reply is no i m beyond that now the one thing this video portrays is the man who is virtually lost in the muddle of holocaust deniers and their opponents the former manipulate him and the latter villify him leuchter is really just a mediocre and unfortunate man who has been thoroughly exploited by people who really don t care about him as anything more than a way to further their own racist agenda to get more aquainted with the real issues behind the leuchter report i would recommend truth prevails demolishing holocaust denial the end of the leuchter report by shelly shapiro which is a collection of articles on the leuchter report written by several of the interviewees in this film among others 
my neighbor totoro more of a dear friend this is an excellent movie for all ages ! get it now experience the magic wonderful story acting and attitude sets this movie from all others 
another great slater film having seen parts of this film over a span of the last decade or so without fully seeing all of it i noticed this dvd on sale at a huge retailer rhymes with ball mart for only i couldn t resist picking it up to see it all finally was it worth it yes i am a straight married guy and a huge fan of christan slater i have seen damn near every movie with him in it and pump was another classic did i love everything about this movie no it definately reeks of late s references and inuendo i e bill and ted clones the story was very well done however it contains major flaws i am a cop and i know for a fact the federal government would not send the fcc after a lone pirate station who is not screaming for the downfall of government but is ranting about the local high school administration i didn t like the ending i won t spoil it for you but just say it could have been better overall it was a out of not bad for a film from 
wow in hell is one of the best jcvd movies from his recent direct to video offerings in the film he plays kyle leblanc a french american man living and working in russia with his american wife who soon gets brutally murdered kyle is then sent to a russian prison after he murders the man who killed his wife of course this prison is no cakewalk actually it makes oswald state prison from the hbo show oz literally look like disney world the warden and guards are all corrupt and the prisoners who have money get all the perks the warden also sets up a human cockfighting arena on the prison grounds where he has two prisoners fight most of the time fight to the death and he and his friends take bets on the winners of course jcvd sets out to make his way through this corrupt system help his new prison friends and get revenge for his wife s death the film is very dark brutal and bloody but it is beautifully filmed there is one scene in particular when kyle is thrown in the hole for misbehaving in that scene after kyle loses hope and tries to hang himself a moth flies down from the window rafters above him and the camera beautifully follows it down as it flutters toward kyle and then it lands on the handle of the spoon that is in his untouched bowl of gruel as if to say eat get stronger and you will be able to free yourself from this place i know it sounds really corny but it is really a lovely scene and not something that you typically see in jcvd films the dvd transfer is awesome picture and sound quality are good and you get widescreen and fullscreen to choose from definitely a movie to see whether you like van damme or not it s a movie for anyone who has ever lost anyone they loved or had their life inexplicably turned upside down and had to fight to get things right

her naked ankles in one of his essays the german philosopher critic walter benjamin compared film with theater stating that the lens of the camera replaces the audience as the spectator but because the camera is emotionless the actor is unable to feed off the audience s reaction however in some films theatrical aspects are not only used but become part of the film itself for anyone who has watched ichikawa kon s an actor s revenge or shinoda masahiro s double suicide this is quite evident while not taking theater into play im kwon taeks extraordinarily popular film chunhyang incorporates the traditional storytelling elements of the pansori a singer and a drummer into play instead of just opening the film the viewer is treated to listening to the pansori s storytelling throughout the entire film even having his voice overdubbed over the actors and actresses while this aspect of the film might be a bit distracting at first especially when the film s action is cut between the stage and the visualized world of chunhyang it eventually sinks in and one can enjoy being told a story while seeing it acted out by actors and actresses instead of just the realm inside one s head chunhyang tells the story of the lovers lee mongryong and sung chunhyang the former the sun of the governor of namson and the latter the daughter of a courtesan a budding scholar who is preparing for the exams that would open to him the world of officialdom mongryong one day becomes bored with his hours of constant study and asks his servant pangja to show him some areas of local interest at one spot he notices a beautiful young girl swinging high in a swing and he falls in love at first sight he orders pangja to fetch the girl for him but the servant is reluctant because chunhyang has a reputation of turning down every man who has shown interest in her however pangja does go speak to her but instead of returning with the girl he returns with a message that mongryong interprets as that chunhyang wants him to come visit her at her home on the night he visits chunhyang the girl eventually agrees to marry him on the promise that he would not abandon her because of their differences in social status he agrees to do so and so they marry and they seem quite blissful at first until mongryong s father receives a promotion which requires him to return to seoul because mongryong has to return to seoul with his father and because he cannot take chunhyang with him because being married to such a lowly girl would destroy his chances of taking the exams the young couple must part but mongryong promises to return for chunhyang after he finishes the exams however during the time that mongryong is away a new corrupt governor takes over the old governor s position and he seems to have an interest in our heroine directed by the man who is considered by many to be the father of modern south korean cinema and the director of nearly one hundred films chunhyang might not at first seem no more than a simple love story but with its elements of traditional storytelling its intermingling of history romance and melodrama it does stand out as a great film within the ever growing number of spectacular south korean films 
tunes of glory criterion collection dvd unquestionably the best movie alex guinness ever made this high definition transfer could not have been better guinness fans shouldn t miss this one

it s finally on dvd i absolutely love this movie when i was in high school a bunch of us went to see it yeah i m dating myself aren t i and i loved it then good to know that years later i still love sliver perhaps it was my giant crush on william baldwin that really made this movie sparkle to me or perhaps it was the voyeuristic ambiance throughout it either way this is a fun little thriller that will keep you entertained for the guys you can oggle sharon stone in all her hotness and as i mentioned for the ladies there s william baldwin to adore basically a woman named carly stone moves into the sliver tower where there have been several weird deaths most recently a woman whose looks resemble carly s who happened to be the former tenant of the apartment carly just bought a variety of suitors attempt to get carly s attention one of which brings her a telescope in turn making her realize that she indeed likes to watch but who s watching carly ah to go into it any further would ruin this fine little movie i m not saying it s the best ever but sliver is plenty of fun for men women alike who enjoy thrillers 
is he nuts or brenna plays a grandfather that is accused of not having all his marbles his g kids try to help him out a great disney presentation superb movie worth the view 
the most fun you can have in a film this is a great film and they really dont make them like this anymore it s funny has some good action scenes and a light hearted story it s even got shemp in it i saw this for the first time yesterday and i enjoyed it so much i went out and bought it 
absolutely hysterical yet refreshing and sweet this is a fall off the couch funny film and one you might as well buy because you are going to watch it again and again for the silliness and comfort for craig ferguson fans it s a must own tcheky karyo fans will chortle as he pops up yet again where least anticipated newly widowed grace pertly played by brenda blethyn finds her dissolute husband has left her nothing but debt creditors and re possessors now besiege her lovely cornish seaside home as she seeks solace in tending her greenhouse orchids she ponders how to get out of the financial quagmire for distraction she charitably tends to her feckless caretaker craig ferguson s ailing personal use cannabis plot and a joint venture blooms as grace and matthew modify the greenhouse cultivate the crop and go to market hilarity as they say ensues the villagers all characters we wish were in our local pub are perfection as they feign ignorance of the entire enterprise while quietly lending unseen support to their beloved neighbor no one is as he or she initially seems and the various reveals in the subplots are charming and delightful there is much s style stoner humor but with an updated wonderful and uniquely british twist obligatory locals inadvertently get stoned sequences are not only original in their construction but somehow innocent and sweet the ladies and the corn flakes scene is certainly one of the finest pieces of physical comedy ever put on film and as the story progresses it evolves from a tale of potentially puerile marijuana mishaps to instead one of the power of love and redemption as grace and matthew each find their salvation in the unfolding of a future neither of them foresaw the ending is pure bliss and an absolute upper get it you ll be delighted 
hiding out is delightful despite lack of praise i can t say enough about this movie it s clearly one of the most underated movies of the s and sadly it was considered one of his worst movies along with many others by pretty much every critic umm ok it rarely airs and not many people have seen it before like the viewer before me said it needs to be re releasedive enjoyed this movie on vhs for years years to be exact and have finally just gotten it on dvd with his talent he deserved alot more than he got out of his acting career in my opinion hollywood is and always will be overated bring back some people who can act he s great on his show but i d love to see him in more main stream movies and hell i don t care if they tank i ll watch them anway how can you not love jon s quirky yet enjoyable acting style and those cute dimples of his yeah i m a girl can t help it give this movie a chance you ll love it if you don t something is seriously wrong with you year old viewer 
i guess there s something wrong with me i guess there must be something profoundly wrong with me because i rather liked maniac sure i ll concede that its definately not for everyone but what is as the old cliche goes one man s trash is another man s treasure so what did i like about maniac while marketed as a slasher film it utilized none of the stock slasher film cliches that were so prevalent at the time namely the all the sluts die but the virgin gets away faux morality of friday the th and halloween the killer is not a super human killing machine like jason or freddy rather this character is real not in a literal sense but its easy to believe that a killer like this could exist maniac is as much a character study as it is a horror film joe spinnel gives an outstanding performance as frank a schizophrenic serial killer he s a three dimensional character and the film is told entirely by his point of view as you will see in the film he s not pure evil he s clearly trying to stop but he can t i actually felt pity for him i was impressed by the more than competant direction and cinematography the film is shot in a very realistic almost documentary style the performances are natural and believable the musical score was excellent as well this film is a textbook example of what can be achieved on a low budget with some imagination and skill i won t be a hypocrite i ll admit it i enjoyed this film on a visceral level while pretty tame by today s standards the gore effects were expertly executed by the always brilliant tom savini if this makes me a sick person then i m no more demented than the millions of fans who line up to see silence of the lambs scarface and hundreds of other visceral films and i m no more sick than the millions of people who spend hours a day playing grand theft auto the point is that its a movie no one ever got hurt by watching a movie or playing a video game for that matter if watching maniac is all it takes to send you over the edge you were probably pretty screwed up to begin with isn t there enough real horrors in the world to get upset about so to those who found the film so offensive that they would condemn everyone who doesn t share in their phony moral indignation why did you bother to watch the film all the way to the end weren t you sufficiently outraged halfway through the film and without giving away too much of the ending it was not stupid as some have charged frank was clearly hallucinating since the film was told by his point of view the audience could see his hallucinations his wounds were purely self inflicted once again the director choose to be original rather than to fall back on the old textbook cliches which in this case would have been a final showdown in which caroline munro kills him highly underratted unfairly bashed and dismissed by critics maniac achieves what it aspires to be a very original and very imaginative horror film with a great performance by joe spinnel for fans of good low budget horror films by the likes of george romero and wes craven this is essential viewing which is why they play it fairly regularly on ifc i ll take this film over final destination and or similar formulatic crap masquerading as horror films any day of the week 
review of stand and deliver i received the dvd in a timely manner the quality of the dvd was good i have had good service from amazon overall it was a good experience and a good product 
how far we ve come when i watched this classic documentary i couldn t help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here we just wouldn t make it what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls body piercing hummers and rap music underneath it all is a heritage that is raw rich and admirable and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now 
next to listening to his recordings this is a fine tribute to a great jazz musician i am not usually a big fan of bio pics about genius musicians because it is impossible to act them playing and after all it is their playing that we care about however clint eastwood brings so much affection and integrity to this film and forest whitaker has such a perfectly fit genius of his own for this role that i think it comes off quite well charlie parker was a tortured soul whose musicianship was so powerful that he was able to teach himself a virtuoso style of playing jazz alto saxophone that has influenced nearly every alto sax player since certainly anyone with pretensions to playing bebop jazz the film captures his difficult beginnings his powerful rise and artistry his terrible drug addictions and how this also provided an unfortunate influence on others and his early far too early death there is the sound of his playing throughout the movie but it is in short snippets we get more over the closing credits but we get enough to remember what is special and unique about his playing everyone talks about his speed and harmonic variety all that is there certainly however there is also so much in parker s commitment to what he is singing through his horn that allows us to feel the music in a way that was unique to him without that ability to reach into the heart of an audience no amount of virtuosity can keep an audience for generations parker is still winning new fans every day and that is his greatest legacy this film is a nice tribute to him it is just so sad that he got onto such a self destructive path and the only way off for him was to die at 
clever creative and funny lilly tomlin is hysterical in this movie she makes this movie it fun and your rooting for the women all the way one specific part is not for the kids my kids were bored with it but i enjoyed it from the release date and it s still entertaining 
great movie good dubbing job totally worth it movie i finally got around watching one of asian cinema s finest classics ringo lam s city on fire i must say i was really impressed the film starts off on a little shaky ground but soon gains its footing and takes off when chow s character also named chow reluctantly goes undercover i really like the scenes where he s first tailed and then actually hunted by rival cops who seem to want nothing short of him being dead the ending is just incredible not just the fireworks but the way loyalty plays out the film is worth watching just for the last minutes although the rest is also well paced and the part with the girlfriend thing is a little boring but does add dimensions to the chow character thanks to chow yun fats good acting dvd i know i m not a purist when it comes to foreign films and i usually don t like subtitles esp chop suey subtitles so forgive me for saying i actually liked the dubbing job on this one there s no chinese soundtrack on this at all just english dub i thought the voice actors did a pretty good job much better than any other dubbed foreign film i ve seen the adr remix was also really good and they even have an english song worked into a nightclub scene i m usually turned off by the high pitched and cacophonous audio effects of hong kong films but the american remix engineers did a very nice job at pairing surround sound audio with the great visual experience ringo lam has given us 
star trek at its best shore leave is one of the best episodesof the classic series it uses all thesci fi props but also has a great story if you don t even care about star trekand have to watch one watch this one

open a book and open a mind with enchanting rhyme and whimsical illustrations dr suess delivers a children s book with lots to consider the butter side up yooks and the butter side down zooks are a parody of the cold war and the crescendo builds as the trivial evolves into a weapons race culminating with a stalemate with each side having a big boy boomeroo the younger readers will be enchanted by the rhythm of the tale and the lesson that grandpa imparts will be better understood by the older readers actually a wonderful book for all ages pair this book with the lorax a once banned suess book and you ll have my favorite baby shower gift 
great book plot adapted to video i had read the winds of war before i saw the miniseries it is not usual for a movie script to convey what makes a book great but this not the case with the winds of war robert mitchum plays a great role as a naval officer who sees himself due to incredible multi language capability serving in naval intelligence in europe and visiting the hot spots of that continent during the late s like nazi germany fascist italy soviet union united kingdom ect his younger son s role plays out like the young are and how blinded they can be by love his wife and her uncle roles are well played and show us those people who still think that a river will not be flooded even though they can hear the water rushing down its course all the roles are well played a good miniseries 
soylent green pure fantasy or potential reality my watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world the premise of the film was disturbing to say the least i have never been a true fan of charleton heston who in my opinion always has overacted however edward g robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played his performance was truly heartfelt bringing to mind the current debate on ending one s own life with dignity i shutter to think that this is life as it should be though but robinson s character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him i found the other actors to be somewhat bland perhaps this was acting at that point in time but some actors can make the most of roles and others cannot the story line was unique but the script was lacking a re make today by steven spielberg might be worthwhile seeing perhaps the most striking element i took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up 
classic a must have for anyone who likes love stories a true classic and should be in everyones collection 
good choice my son is years old and he loves this game he is a bionicle fanatic ! 
response to mr tamm i m not making any comments about this film as it s a long time since i last saw it but i do want to register my objection to mr tamm s calling smash palace an australian film it was a new zealand film made in new zealand by a new zealand director roger donaldson about new zealand characters and starring mainly new zealand actors bruno lawrence greer robson keith aberdeen it has no connection whatsoever with australia this is almost as bad as when peter jackson s third lord of the rings movie won all academy awards for which it was nominated and after billy crystal had been making jokes all night about everyone in new zealand having been thanked in the various acceptance speeches the following morning a prominent us newspaper referred to peter jackson as an australian director we are not australians 
a pirate you can t help but love this movie entertained me as a child and still does today suzanne pleshette dean jones are great but the constant scene stealing as always is done by peter ustinov his dialogue works well with the special effects that were available at the time you might forget for a moment that he s a ghost and then the movie shows the perspective from everyone else suzanne pleshette s character is trying her best not to fall in love with someone that might be crazy and can t help herself if you enjoy disney movies this one will entertain everyone i love it 
rare laserdiscs dvds movies collector wild style s one of my greatest movies i own the dvd and you should too you wont regret addin it to your collection

classically chilling this isn t breakfast at tiffany s neither is it nightmare on elm st but wait until dark starring audrey hepburn is truly chilling hepburn plays a blind lady who through the circumstances of the plot is pitted against a dangerous criminal and his two henchmen she slowly realizes she is in danger and after smashing the lights in to level the playing field must struggle for her life in her apartment more along the lines of a thriller like pyscho than a horror film wait until dark is scary but classy 
dvd hey i m a huge fnm fan i haven t seen this video yet because i m waiting for it to come out on dvd does anyone know about it coming out on dvd 
doctor who and the first download doctor who materialised without his tardis on this my first timelord download in the amazon unbox which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside for a very reasonable sum my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration where he encounters the nestene conciousness the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental a great experience and will not be the last easy to navigate and fun for all the family someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type tardis 
when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
a really well done film i have to say that i really enjoyed this film it is well done and not to mention beautifully shot it has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of hollywood these days most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed this film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint if you love horses adventure beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse then please do see it and lets face it ladies viggo mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him he is a very good actor and an underated one at that so sit back pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure and admire one of god s most majestic creations the horse and viggo mortensen ! 
dvd instinct absolutely great ! i have it on video and replaced the video with dvd anthony hopkins and cuba gooding jr are definately two of my most favorite actors dee moffatport angeles w

good old child hood memories finallyy on dvd when i was six i loved this film i used to watch it all the time when i was younger now i can t find the video cassette tape of robot jox i ve decided to get the dvd finally it came out on dvd it takes them forever to release a dvd sometimes the only thing i m bummed about is no special features no behind the scenes or not even a theatrical trailer oh well at least they released the movie on dvd can t wait to get it in the mail i might be years old now but i love my childhood favorites 
funnier than a breakaway chastity belt this film should be seen in its uncut and unrated video version the theatrical release was butchered by moralists and punishment freaks when it first hit the screens in the mid s kathleen turner shows what a fine and brave actress she is in every scene however the film belongs to anthony perkins who seems to be overdosing on meth with his breathlessly loony performance he proves that he can find the sadness and humanity in a completely insane character he was a supremely gifted actor and its a shame he died when he did this is strange and enjoyable movie but prudes beware it has a lot of sexual content 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
my favourite movie this is the most hilarious movie with john candy stuck inside a terrible soap opera ! he can control events and turn himself into a hero by using his magic typewriter it is sooooo funny the characters are idiots like the doctor who keeps yelling iam a medicaldoctor and the man whos being poisoned and his hair comes out and then he wipes his finger over his eyebrow and it comes off in his hand and then his teeth fall into the sink and then he tries to shoot his sister who is poisoning him only it isn t really his sister because she was swapped at birth so he accidentally shoots his real sister and he cant talk properly anymore and so he says ahshthit lolol my mum is grossed out by the man who is losing his bits so she taped over the movie once i love it its soooo funny 
this show is the funniest thing on tv right now i ve never watched any shows regularly on fx until this year when i happened to catch a double episode of it s always sunny in philadelphia about episodes into season i don t remember when i ve laughed so hard in the past few years this show is hysterical ! charlie day what can i say i dare say he is the funniest character on television case in point the episode hundred dollar baby the gang s walking home in the evening charlie mac dennis and dee when an apparent meth head tries to mug them charlie mac and dennis all run away knocking down dee to fend for herself intentionally or non intentionally you decide dee gets mugged and decides she s going to take some kind of boxercizing thing to learn how to defend herself but her dad frank played by danny devito pipes up and says if she wants to learn to defend herself she should learn from him being that he s a former boxer frankie fast hands she agrees in the meantime dennis and mac convince charlie to become an underground street fighter after attending one and realizing that all you really need is to be able to take a worse beating than the other guy mac asks dennis you know who can take a beating and they both instantly turn to each other and say charlie whats great about charlie is that he s usually up for anything as long as there s money or excitement in it and this is no exception back to dee at the gym she s approached by another woman who offers her some assistance in the form of so called performance enhancing supplements dee s now popping pills which charlie sees while accidentally catching her she doesn t know he saw her and now charlie is popping her pills i refuse to spoil the rest but rest assured that this is one of the funniest things you will see this year and the rest of the series is no exception i have yet to see an un funny character on this show but charlie steals the show almost every time charlie day is comedy gold 
not your run ofthemill film eccentric with a great cast of wacko characters dinklage is spectacular in this film it s a pity that the roles in hollywood for small people are so limited and ordinarily so stupid elves munchkins jesters dinklage outshines most of his contemproraries and this is likely to be one of the few big serious roles he will ever be given maybe cg will get to the point where films will incorporate special effects that are the reverse of the hobbitizing done in the lotr movies turning dinklage into a cary grant ! this film has a great set of oddball supporting characters too an overly needy hotdog seller a spaced out artist mourning the death of her son a train loving elementary school kid and a very young and newly pregnant librarian hottie dinklage plays the irritable fin who has inherited a decaying train station in rural new jersey from a friend fin plans to move to the out oftheway spot and live in complete isolation he soon runs into a wacky cast of characters in some cases literally olivia the artist runs him off the road twice in one day who won t leave him alone each has their own emotional baggage and their own peculiar hurts and disabilities against all odds the motley crew become friends the plot summaries for this film make it sound like a sapfest but this movie is far from it it is sort of touching but in a of burr like sort of way prickly a bit odd and it sticks with you for a long time after 
explosive movie special features are a dud i am partial to this movie and that is why i m giving it five stars if you like darby o gill and the little people as i do you ll love this film the falure of this dvd lies in it s lack of special features and i would be living in a dream world if i ever thought disney would give us a better release of this movie because the simple fact of the matter is that it s not going to happen but hey at least we got it on dvd 
s classic the breakfast club one of the best movies out there timless no matter what s your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie ! 
not for everybody this movie certainly is different i must say right off the bat thought it is not for everybody it is the story of a woman who after wwii is checking into a hotel with her husband and comes to find that the porter is or was a concentration camp officer who had used and mentally and physically abused her but its not that cut and dried here is where it gets a little weird seems that her porter had developed an almost effection for here and strangely she for him even though she was put thru by him and with him a living nightmare it is almost like the stokholm syndrome of the victim becomes sympathetic to their captor they become drawn to one another and basically fall in love with one another but because of their past have a strange masochistic and sadistic way of expressing it there is also a subplot of him protecting her from an odessa or de spider type organization of ex nazis who after finding out about her want her taken care of he cannot of course go along with this and does everything he can to protect her again this movie is not for everybody and some may not get it i must say though that this movie is not porn in anyway and is not graphic in that way whatsoever it is a strange love story that is like nothing else i have ever seen check it out and keep an open mind 
great this is a great way to enjoy this very rare japanese tv shows this is my first download and the quality is very good and i talking about tv show johnyy sokko and his flying robot also know in all latinamerica like robot gigante one of the big japanese sience fiction shows of the s like ultra man space giants and ms comet in this version of johnny sokko you can see it in full color its no black and white like the promo picture displayed in this first episode dont expect good special efects as you see this is a very old show i saw it when i was a kid i give stars because they really rescue the showand was one of my favorites a looong time ago good job guys ! sorry for my bad english but im trying my bes 
worthy its hard to know if you would understand what actually happned at isandlewana if all you hadto go on was this film but all the elements are there screwed down ammo boxes underestimation of zulu capabilities a trumped up rationalization of why we are going to anex zulu land the personalities or lack of them overall a feast for the military historian not as satisafctory as a movie no happy ending here the missing element here is that although this was a major embarase ment for the british empire the subsequent victory at rourkes drift allowed them to save face regroup and ultimately devestate the zulu 
stars for the movie star for monica potter i could write a bunch of stuff here trying to convince you that i m smarter than you but that s pretty much a waste of my time and yours i like this movie in spite of a few flaws and glitches to me the overall product is often more important than the parts it s comprised of the story line has interesting twists it has actors in it i like so i give the movie itself three stars and toss in another star just because i get to watch morgan freeman act and monica potter be cute as hell i just really really wish she could act but cute will do not a bad way to spend an hour or two 
we want more montez this dvd is absolutely gorgeous the technicolor is so vivid and beautiful like an early disney film i have watched my new copy already three times it is so much fun to watch on every level lovely to look at and the best campy humor to top it off while i love this film it is quite tame compared to some of the wonderful excesses that were to follow in this cycle of cult favorite maria montez classics thank you universal for finally releasing one of your classic easterns onto dvd but please don t stop maria s fans are legion her films are some of the hardest to find and most desireable to collectors remember of the six films she did with jon hall at universal only two were ever even released on vhs the demand is high please universal give us a maria montez collection with the remaining five easterns cobra woman alone is probably the most famous camp classic to never merrit a dvd release we want more

b movie splendor i would have to say this was a brilliant movie i was highly entertained from this mr corman and hill flick beautiful women getting roughed up from the somewhat feminine guards pam grier gets your full attention 
fabulous childhood memories brought back to me even though this cinderella does not have the modern day movie magic in fact the sets are pretty corny that does not hurt or take away any of the wonderful memories of when i was a little girl and looked forward every year for the airing of cinderella and the wizard of oz i was thrilled to have found this and would highly highly recomend it to any woman out there that has the memory of this wonderful version of cinderella leslie ann warren is simply timeless in this 
the best i am very glad with my purchase fast delivery and very security package nanc 
only one question my only question is when can i buy season this is the perfect medium to continue the most enjoyed show that tv execs killed this decade 
best of the series anyway let s go easy and be fair caged heat deserved its rank as the best of the women inprison series that marked the glory days of drive in movies although jonathan demme s directorial debut was not a real success it gave us a chance to enjoy the glamour of so many beautiful girls while showing their skin off and on did try their best to act as well erica gavin the famous vixen in vixen roberta collins pam grier s co star in such previous wip flicks as women in cages the big bird cage the big doll house rainbeaux smith aka cheryl smith in slumber party juanita brown pam grier s co star in foxy brown etc what else can we ask for i m glad to watch caged heat again now on dvd so i can go to any hot chapter any time too bad vixen hasn t been released on dvd yet but if you like this one i would recommend all the above mentioned wip hits of the s they aren t as good as caged heat but still worth checking out for their own flavors 
the effects of ignorance errol morris via the fog of war proved that he is one of the most talented documentary filmmakers of our day this film directly proceeded the mcnamera classic but much of his skill at the genre is on display the interplay of music and camera and the way in which he captures onscreen the unsuspecting and pathetic fred leuchter is artful this is true even the close ups of coffee pots and electrical currents emanating from his head during the opening that viewers feel sympathy for this confused broken man who is devoid of social skills and social comprehension is an unintended consequence of the vehemence in which the forces of political correctness attacked him he definitely had no idea as to the way he would be vilified simply by appearing at the zundel trial leuchter an engineer in deed only with no scientific academic background whatsoever conducted a middle school like science experiment at birchenau and believed based on some shoddy chemical analysis that no cyanide gas was used there the result was that his life was ruined personally as a life long learner who has never been and will never be a historical revisionist the destruction of fred leuchter is appalling i completely believe and know that the holocaust occurred but am aghast that certain activists think they have the right to destroy of the lives of those who disagree with them why didn t these brave activists respond to his arguments rather than conduct a campaign of hate his positions are juvenile leuchter knew nothing about chemical tests history or society in general he was an easy mark but their emotionalizing the issue had the reverse effect it made people think they had no answers to his arguments it legitimizes revisionism by squashing this non entity they made him a martyr what they should have done was publish vigorous refutations instead they made leuchter appear a champion of free inquiry which by the way he is in comparison to shrieking critics and the canadian government this is the way in which political correctness and reckless emotion have damaged our intellects and degraded our culture bullying shaming and forcing guilt upon others is exactly how you vile personas like ernst zundel were created in the first place zundel is a reaction to such attempts 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
better than it has every right to be it s not a great movie but it s a lot of fun this is one of those movies that just catches me it s quirky and has some decent for it s day effects there are a feww laugh out loud momments truth be told they are few and far between some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble the cast is pretty damn cool with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman angellica houston john mat mattus the big guy anyway it s cornball comedy with a basic plot hey what do you want it s s chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been i still giggle at the time warp battle 
no holds barred irreverent not for the easily offended this has got to be the funniest most warped show on cable today it s the ultimate show about nothing a group of morally deficient somethings who own an irish pub in philadelphia they care about nothing but outdoing each other for attention and money they constantly argue over the dumbest things and come from families more dysfunctional than anyone can imagine to give you an idea of the show s themes there are episodes that revolve around one of the characters trolling for dates at an abortion rally another in which the gang tries to outdo each other by pretending to be crippled just to see who can get the most attention and sympathy from strangers and an episode in which the gang charges people to view a vision of the virgin mary actually a water stain in the bar the dialogue is made up of all the things people are thinking but won t say no tender or sappy moments here these are episodes you would never see on the hallmark channel or lifetime one of the most unique comedies on tv and by far one of the best i look forward to many more new seasons of its always sunny and am hopeful it does not lose its edge or pursue milktoast or nonoffensive story lines 
this has been a love story i finally made my first purchase from amazon s unbox video downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience for i purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of the twilight zone and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection i don t think it s the most ideal way to see full length motion pictures but for a minute classic tv program i think my lcd monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean aired on september as the show s third season opener the episode is a cold war fantasy appropriately called two about the last two survivors on earth a man and a woman after an apocalyptic world war in written and directed by tv veteran montgomery pittman the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an american infantryman and she is an invading russian soldier like two feral animals they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him the reality of their solitary existence however gradually dawns on them especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue prekrassnyi the russian word for lovelywhat really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting two years before she twitched her nose on bewitched a brunette elizabeth montgomery looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun plays the untrusting russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability the american is played by perennial tough guy charles bronson fresh from the magnificent seven even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism they make an odd couple but it works splendidly i also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the nd century narrated by rod serling in his inimitably halting manner the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript this has been a love story this is classic tv 
woooooooooooow i love it sooooo much it s the big new thing can t wait the next episode 
glad disney took a chance i m not in the habit of reviewing movies but i m making an exception for this one because my kids love this movie and it is my favorite disney outing to date though i also enjoyed tron dinosaur and almost anything from pixar this fast paced re imagined version of robert louis stevenson s classic story is watchable for many reasons but i enjoyed the great voice acting the brandywine school inspired backgrounds and the interesting hybridization of futuristic elements with th century technology im glad disney didn t play it straight with this one bonus the most artful combined usage of traditional and cg animation to date two pieces of music contributed by john rzeznik of the goo goo dolls make a great soundtrack greater 
the best of those english working class films of the era this one was a shocker to me especially after my usual ranting against the english movies of this period and anything with laurence harvey in particular that said i loved this movie and damn if julie christie didnt deserve that oscar over julie andrews ! she is great as a vapid self involved ditz who uses her looks in climbing up the social ladder finding herself in progressively more vile situations dirk bogarde is one of her lovers laurence harvey another but the movie really is the property of miss christie who gives a performance as breathtaking as her looks 
lorax fond memories pontoffel wow we rented the lorax because i realized i hadn t seen it since on a reel toreel tape in my elementary school library but i loved it somehow years later i knew a lot of words to the songs but was struck by how much the message of the movie is relevant today if anything these days this movie would not be shown in a public school or on television because the fcc would investigate its subversive message of enviromentalism critique of consumerism and caring for others as for pontoffel pock his magic piano i have no memory of this movie and i have to say that it is one of the most bizarre things i ve ever seen let s just say theodore giesel meets timothy leary and ken kesey and keep it at that 
a white cat after viewing wag the dog i can say that i did in fact enjoy watching it but i m not wholly sure why well lets start with a few problems i had with it to give my head a chance to think it over one more time my main beef with this film is that at some times the plot drags along a little too slow without hardly anything happening or much keeping you distracted until a plot twist came into effect i also have to say that i thought their choice for background music quite odd for what the movie was based on the music used although hardly used makes the whole thing seem light hearted or like a fairly tale which for this movie is bad because the whole idea of it is to make he viewer question what the media tells you and music like that just makes it a little harder to believe anyway i really liked the idea of not even including the president as a character in the movie he was just heard from the other end of the phone saying dumb things like that cat should defiantly be white or it sounds too corny that adds to the main reason i enjoyed this movie its unconventional yet still effective it doesn t really fit into one given genre so i have to slap the broad drama comedy label onto it which makes it difficult to compare to other movies of the aforementioned genres what i mean by that is that i couldn t recommend this to a fan of comedy or drama because it ends up being a mix of both so if you a genre buff you probably won t enjoy wag the dog but people with an open mind will however be able to see past the need of having a genre plastered on everything and enjoy this movie for what it is the acting is as expected from just a star studded cast that includes such big names as robert de niro dustin hoffman dennis leary and willie nelson i don t know how much better you could expect the acting in a movie to be of course its really hoffman and di niro who shine in this movie they work well off each other making you forget who they are in real life and think of them as stanley motss and conrad brean all in all i would recommend wag the dog to anyone who enjoys movies comedies satires and or people who just enjoy a new idea or plot take it from someone who has only ever really enjoyed a handful of movies in their life you should see this movie 
uncredited asian actor the name of the uncredited asian actor who plays the fake mr moto is teru shimada 
very touching movie about tolerance this movie should be used in schools to teach about tolerance i don t understand why it is r rated as far as i know it could have been made by disney the plot ludovic is a confused seven year old boy he finds out he fancies a boy in his class and likes to dress up as a girl because he is so innocent he casually tells his parents he would like to marry jerome later when told that boys can only marry girls he replies i know that ! because he really perceives himself as a girl what he comes across is incomprehension frustration and anger from everyone in his family as well as school mates and neighbors if you are looking for a movie that will make you both laugh and cry watch it today you won t regret it ! 
one wof the best horror movies of all time okay let me start the opening scene is a classic we all know it the killer asks drew berrymore whats your favorite scary movie then minets later she s done i love it this scene has so much suspence and so does the rest of the movie this movie is so good go buy it 
a raw look at the fab before the beatles changed the world of music they were a scruffy rock n roll five piece lennon and mccartney were already writing music together but lennon spent much of his time hanging with fellow artist stu sutcliffe lennon talked his pal into spending the money from the sale of a painting into buying a bass guitar and suddenly the silver beatles had a new bassist albeit one that couldn t play any instrument but that soon changed this terrific film chronicles the early days of the band in hamburg before they broke it big and the strong friendship of lennon and sutcliffe ian hart virtually steals the film from stephen dorf whos also quite good capturing lennon s swagger and sarcastic wit in full stride directly ian softley focuses more on the duo of lennon and sutcliffe than the rest of the band chronicling their friendship sutcliffe never lived to see lennon and the rest of the band achieve their dreams of going to the top and conquer the world it s a fascinating glimpse into the past and it s clear that softley did quite a bit of research to make this marvelous film hart had played lennon once before in the house and times a film that portrayed a supposed homosexual fling between lennon and the band s manager brian epstein most of the performances capture the essence of the the beatles even if they don t always look exactly like the people their playing the duo hart and gary bakewell at least resemble lennon and mccartney while softley claims he was trying to capture the raw sound of the band in the beginning which i m sure he does my only complaint is that the singers don t sound all that much like lennon or mccartney still the supporting musicians drawn from members of rem afgan wigs nirvana and other groups do create quite a sound the big difference between this and the bare bones release of a couple of years ago are all the extras we get ian softley s sundance channel interview an interview of softley and hart discussing the making of the film an audio interview with astrid kirchherr with old photos of her stu and others along with footage from the film to illustrate what she s saying two deleted scenes footage of the band of actors rehearshing audition video shot for the movie behind thescenes photos and an audio commentary from the director univeral has done an exceptional job in remastering the video and audio its a terrific package i m glad that this drama has finally made it to dvd in such a deluxe presentation take a trip into the past and rediscover what made the beatles so special to begin with in backbeat 
kiss today goodbye this is a release and stars michael douglas as a broadway director casting dancers for a large production i enjoyed the movie yet completely agree with others that the stage version is much better and makes more sense of the story line many people saw the stage version first i do understand their frustration with the film in particular it skews the number what i did for love into emphasizing the love story between cassie and zach what it s really about is the love and dedication dancers have for what they do through all the blood sweat and tears i went out of order and saw the movie first and wound up thoroughly enjoying the stage version a positive experience last rather than the generally negative reception from those who sequenced the other way best strategy is to enjoy each the stage version and film version for what they are entertainment 
most excellent movie ever this item is a must have for all transformer fans out there not only will you get a excellent d poster dvds on transfomers the movie but all the extras this item is epic size in terms of value 
funny this movie is really funny ! steve martin and goldie hawn work really well gether this comedy kept me intrested from beginning to end i enjoyed it alot 
in your face and gripping just a great movie a breath of fresh air because unlike most of the films about girls boys or men are the center of everything and this film focused on the relationships and love between the girls and it accurately portrays the feelings of lost uncontented teens who know that there has to be something more the funny sequences in this movie are almost too funny a couple of the people who were watching it with me turned blue and it has some great one linersfun to watch it picks you up and won t put you down 
pokemon will last forever the movie is the next segment in the pokemon movies which supplies everything on hopes and dreams of a pokemon warrior named ash ketchim and his friends they go out and they look battle and run into new pokemon and take on new adventures with pikachu and other pokemon favorities this adventure takes on with a new pokemon called celebi a time pokemon go join brock and misty to find all sorts of new things 
the best movie ever if you have not seen this movie you dont know what your missing this is the best movie i have seen in years 
a powerful and romantic love story this is a charming flick about two teenage boys who discover their love for one another after harrowing circumstances land them in the same apartment and eventually in the same bed 
another good csi ny though csi ny is most least favorite of the three csis they still manage to make a good one sometimes this is one of those good ones 
logan s run i have always loved this movie but it was very hard to find it is such a relief to have a place to find rare movies in such great condition this movie will make you really think about the future and also about how far our movie technology has come 
fascinating my husband and i watched this and we both give it stars it s fascinating sad and really thought provoking 
wow this is a must see by everyone this movie had me from the first minute until the very end ! believe me that is unusual forget the actors just get into the story the people it is true it is awful it is wonderful ! i have told all my friends who haven t seen it that like me they have missed one of the greatest movies of our time ! watch it more than once please 
those magnificant men and their flying machines this was sent in great shape it also is a great older movie about the first flying machines to be in that era it involves a race of these older machines that was a lot of fun to watch 
a valuable message i liked this movie very much it was entertaining funny charming but i especially liked the twist toward the end i felt it put out a message that really needs to be understood by everyone these days that is as this movie attempts to show the feelings shared between partners in same sex relationships are no different than those shared in hetero relationships they are just as genuine moving loving and caring everyone can relate to them if they just let themselves i applaud the writer and those who starred in the movie 
best concert i ve ever seen and i ve seen over by almost as many different artists paul simon s free concert in central park in the summer of is still the one by which i compare all others of course it didn t hurt to be a life long fan of the man s music music flawless and absolutley joyful and fun that was but a part of it there was a universal positive energy that hundreds of thousands people there experienced i was not at woodstock but i would speculate the vibe was similar unfortunately this cannot be captured and transferred onto cd or vhs even dvd still a joyous and magnificent concert to listen to and watch absolute magic i remember paul co performing you can call me al twice in a row much to the delight of the crowd during which chevy chase made a surprise cameo on the stage so surprising paul that he missed an entire verse there were three encores that night after finishing the second paul was so overwhelmed by the unconditional adoration from the audience that he fell down the stairs there is a review here from a viewer the one bad part of the whole night was that the crowd a staggering cheered at quite a few wrong moments well dood you weren t there now waiting for the dvd release of this timeless gem 
the ageless summer it was a fantastic movie when it was first released and it is still just as good great photography good narrative makes me long for the summer days i used to spend on the beach at santa cruz 
blackmail death and sex invade a family this fine film has many stories one might be the story of individualism versus society where the former is represented by two blackmailing men out to make a dollar and the latter represented by a woman and her three children and absent navy husband maintaining a family but the strongest and most interesting one to me centres on the journey the handsome character played by goran visjnic makes from criminal to something of a rdeeming figure when he cannot effectively carry through the task assigned to him by his partner in the blackmailing strategy they have devised with an excellent music score strong design characteristics fine acting by all concerned this is a very fine film indeed worthy reviewing from time to time 
just as great as the tv episodes the great thing about this movie version is that all the original voices of clifford john ritter emily elizabeth cleo and t bone are exactly the same as the clifford episodes on tv basically it is a longer version of a regular clifford episode but they ve added a few new friends and some songs here and there speaking of the songs are actually upbeat and a bit catchy but not so catchy to where i find the tunes stuck in my head for hours unlike some other kid movies ie thomas the tank engine where they play the same droning chorus over and over and over again this movie is a great compromise because my and a year old son loves it and after watching it with him numerous times now i still like it too 
under the full cherry moon i think you have to see this movie a second time to fully appreciate it there is alot of subtlties that i didn t pick up on until i watched it again years later all the acting was fantastic a standout performance for the actor who played the salesman at the hotel weird arama the movie ends up being completely freaky and surreal and ya got to have a warped mind to fully grasp the surrealness of the coen brothers strange arama 
another good csi ny though csi ny is most least favorite of the three csis they still manage to make a good one sometimes this is one of those good ones 
it s jimmy carr need more be said thanks for keeping a brit sane in a country full of my wife says jokes your wife is fat and ugly and i don t care what she says because she s ugly and fat and not my wife 
informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
genius putting it simply this film is the work of a genius as a tom stoppard fanatic i adored it from the moment i read the play which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with he was significantly more satisfied with the movie and there is very little doubt as to why he clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film they may or may not like it but that s not what matters this film is amazing 
gets better with time the first time i saw this film was when it came out in and at the time i was terribly disappointed didn t like the film at all thought it was amateurish and pretentious but then i watched it recently on dvd and realized that it was a really good film performances were all really good i liked seeing the dc scenery and the directing by mike nichols was wonderfully subtle despite the fact that both nicholson and streep can sometimes be overpowering and that nicholson did get a bit hammy at times in this i still can t abide the scene where he sings i found both of their performances to be deep and nuanced the co stars were good too added a lot and i especially enjoy catherine o haras portrayal of a gossip carly simon s singing really does set the tone well for this movie which is definitely worth watching and if you don t like it the first time watch it again in a year or two and i ll bet you ll re appraise it more positively 
the mccourts if you are a fan of the mccourt literary legacy then you will definately want to add this to your collection it is an informative thoughtful and touching film that is sure to add to the whole mccourt experience 
very hilarious truely speaking this is a very hilarious episode must see for every one 
hilarious entertainment my sister and i were flipping the channels late one dateless night in high school when we stopped on hbo and this movie was on we laughed so hard that we were crying chad lowe is so cute and funny i thought it was going to turn out to be low budget and stupid but i thoroughly enjoyed it if you like to laugh buy this movie 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods 
exactly what we needed this was just what we needed my grandson was studying the book at school and the movie brought it all together for him it made it more timely and real 
chinese extras menu hey the extras disc has menus in chinese they still work and you can view all the stuff but you have to guess at what each menu option will do anyone else get this 
intriguing this was a great movie kept me in suspense buy it 
ha ha ha great movie ha ha ha greatly funny a must get hillarious wow and a ha ha i recomend this movie to all who love rock and to all who love comedy and those who love both to 
endearing sequel this is an impressive sequel and a very good looking follow up to anne of the green gables it is great to see megan follows as anne shirley once again megan follows is just perfect in this role anne shirley is now a bit older has become a teacher and is quite involved in a society away from her rural settings this gradual progression of characters and story from this original is very welcome and enjoyable it is very endearing in many ways as was the original 
great holiday story sequals are rarely successful but this film proves the exception it is at least as good and in some ways better than the original quotprancerquot it is a really nice holiday story that should please both children and adults yes it is a fantasy but one grounded in reality which makes it the best kind of make believe from the opening the viewer knows what the results will be it is obvious who the divorced mother will end up with the reindeer will actually be one of santa s and the unpleasant person will get his just dues but the way the events unfold make it a really enjoyable story the characters are true to life with excellent preformances from the children this could become a christmas classic 
bold tragic and thought provoking oh nooooooooo it s tragic how some of hollywood s greatest films are doomed from the start by efforts to conceal the serious subject matter with confusing or misleading box covers or by presenting subject matter that requires brain matter activity i agree with all reviews of the well delivered performances by the then virtually unknown barton and rockwell at least to me barton s performance akin to the seemingly natural talent of dakota please don t screw dakota s head up i m counting on oscar performances after the awkward years but i digress the beauty of the film was in what was not spelled out like a novel that people still can t figure out why is better than the movie aside from the short lived ego rush of sharing the fact that you can read it s the imagery unique to our own life experinces that makes a novel a personal experience that often conflicts with the director s life experiences plus he she has more money for crack and other mind altering substances ok my point ! our society s heinously counterproductive view of sex sin and alas child molestor profiling has taken us back at least years in the age of consent for sex was nfw you say yeah way ! wrong yes geared toward safe sex with kids bad lawn dogs reminds us that the human mind is fully developed at age and kids have intelligent idealistic regretless and raw opinions a need to be heard and understood and guess what else they like to touch their peepees and they know it in they still like to touch their peepees but society and mom and dad relieve them to the long term detriment of their children of the ability to reason and manipulate their environment until at least in essence we discredit their abilty for rational thought with regard to sex but empower them with the ability to manipulate someone into jail with the mere mention of the only crime that requires no intent or forethought and true or not a life sentence of societal periah this movie struck a nerve ya think we need to stop the perves mistake not my words for anything short of this lawn dogs dares to go where few film makers dare even if mostly left to us to conclude that molesters seldom meet our expectations and place of origin we can get a better handle of what we are up against without the kneejerk reactions mob thinking and the removal of the concept of personal accountability for their innocent but real actions that can draw an unlikely and previously unblemished molester from his primative idish shell like this film it will require thought and above all honesty about what goes on in a child s mind where normal sexual curiousity is alive and well and about where we came from to arrive at this civilized yet god alienating society ask yourselves this question which is scarier ca only registered sex offenders or wienee waggers all waiting to catch you with your guard down or a few hundred with long lascidious pasts that you will recognize from a mile away clad in trenchcoats and you wouldn t let your daughter have contact with a stranger anyway sex offender is not synonymous with child molestor except with the network news you ll remember this when your son or close relative is registered for hanging a ba from a bus on the way to a football game in college yaweah 
wow ! what a fun movie a fun movie all around ! winona ryder and ethan hawke are definately the standout stars ! eventhough it s basically a romance movie it still rocks the house ! i looooove the gen x s feeling it has to it it really took me back lalaine s desire to hustle money was a great learning lesson too i also think that she picked the best one in the end but the best thing about reality bites is it s great filming location h town makes me sooooo proud to be from here 
am i my brothers keeper i am a resident of central new york and this story was very well known to everybody in these parts if your reading this you probally have read some of the other reviews so i ll be brief this is an incredible film you are taken to a place that exists and people that are exactly what you see its almost like travelling back to the turn of the century when you visit the ward farm the ward brothers were indeed considered outsiders by some locals but they ultimatelywere a genuine thread that made up the fabric of this community and after delbert is charged with his brothers murder and when the people sensed a railroading by a politically minded d athey rally to delbert s defense it is a unique look at small town america from its citizens its lifestyle and its politics the film is sometimes funny disturbing and even uncomfortable at times but it is as powerful an experience as you could ever have like another documentary i have seen sunshine hotel about flophouses on the bowery in new york city it pulls no punches and hits hard gritty and bold it will resonate long after its final credits have rolled 
rambo revisited i don t mind that the idea of this movie was pretty much taken from rambo however it would have been nice if the idea was improved upon in some ways it was but not enough to give this movie any real depth or realism what i really liked about this movie is its use of johnny cash s music at the very beginning and at the very end we are presented with songs by cash that i was previously unaware of the idea to use these particular songs for this movie was a great choice and gives us an excellent prelude and conclusion to the theme of the movie 
would recommend to fans of independent film not a big fancy film but very good for a small independent film the cast as a whole gave a great performance jon brandis in one of his last projects was excellent i wish this film had been given the wider theatrical release it deserved 
he s broken our window the thing i like about jeremy brett s series of sherlock holmes adventures is not only his brilliant performance as baker street s famous quotunofficialquot consulting detective but it is probably the most accurate production of sir arthur conan doyle s novels this is probably the best and most enjoyable story in brett s final series as sherlock holmes and his performance is in top from he seems very comfortable in the role and the result is an accurate and eccentric performance much like the way conan doyle originally wrote the character in this one holmes and his friend and colleague doctor john watson has received a message from an elderly woman about a strange bid to purchase her estate from a mysterious buyer soon holmes and watson find that the purchase is connected to the woman s deceased grandson who was writing a manuscript before his death that may have something to do with this mystery buyer s desire to buy her house if you have never seen jeremy brett s performance as sherlock holmes this is a great video to start out with and if you remember watching sherlock holmes on pbs in your childhood and wish to reaquaint yourself with the series make this video your first purchase he is in my opinion the definitive sherlock holmes 
classic heroic propaganda there is good propaganda and bad alexander nevsky obviously falls into the former category so much about this film seems prophetic done in the former soviet union stood on the brink of war as did the rest of the world at that time this is a film that celebrates the heroic slavic spirit of yore there were also many useful similarities for comparison like th century rus russia in faced enemies both to the east and west a recent victory over the japanese in helped to erase memories of the russo japanese war of and it seems no coincidence that eisenstein was allowed to make this film at that time make no mistake about it this is a film born out ofsoviet stalinist propaganda of the period no viewer can truly understand this film without understanding that reality in its scope and production value one is reminded of a simlier film done in facist italy around this time celebrating the exploits of ancient rome scipio africanus both films draw on inspirational leaders of the past to serve up useful propaganda for the present in this film rus is besiged on all sides by enemies the mongols had conquiered much of the land by this time to the west there are the crusading teutonic knights seeking to exercise a lebenstraum of their own in the th century nevsky a local prince seems the natural leader that the great city of novgorod needs again we see nationalistic ideas expressed here that were surely beyond the outlook of the time few could have had any notion of a greater rus in such feudal times for eisenstein s propaganda we must have a strong and inspirational alexander nevsky the actor who plays him is certainly impressive looking but hardly any great thespian ! actually all of the characters hwon in the film are pretty one dimensional indeed much of the acting here is wooden at best but there is certain sarcastic humor which is nonetheless appealing the crude love interest between two leading males and the russian princess is an attempt to throw some light fair into the otherwise heavy story the teutonic knights are shown in all their horid glory seldom is evil shown more impressively on screen than here ! with dark faces cruel eyes and heavy looks the knights look every bit the part of the latter day nazi s depicted here they are nazi s of the middle ages and their white hooded cavalry brings up images of the kkk almost ! there is also a very blatant slap at the cathloic church sanctioning in the film the slaughter of innocents and babes is it not surprising that a soviet film should condemn rome as rome had done the same to them ! surprising is the lack of the orthedox church in the film which certainly would have been a main source of moral support for resistence against its enemies only at the end of the film are they shown briefly before nevsky dominates the final scene the battle of lake peipis in is the central theme of the movie this is magnificently done the initial charge of the knights over the ice is one of the most impressive cinematic cavalry charges on film whether such a charge was actually done against massed infantry with long spears seems debatable such an infantry phalanx would have been almost impervious against heavy cavalry in this period the hand tohand combat scenes are as good as anything you might see today there is also that sardonic since of humor thrown in as well the massive battle ebbs and flows the amazing thing is that these are extras not computer graphics ! we see some interesting examples of tactics as the german knights are shown to rally in a close formation with lances supported by cross bows and light troops eisenstein wants to show us the terror of germanic discipline but russian elan and spirt overcomes all and the knights are finally sent in head long retreat until they are swallowed up by the thin ice on the lake again this seems somewhat like enduring myth but most myths do have some ground for basis if closley examined no doubt so knights were lost in this way the film concludes with a victory procession and the one dimensional characters finding happiness in their newly won freedom the dvd does the film little justice as no attempt has been made to clear up the picture or improve the sound track prokofiev s interesting music sounds like it is coming out of a submarine this film badly needs a criterion production to fashion it up like the classic it truly is still don t turn it down because of this problem this film shall remain a classic of its kind see it for its granduer humor and depiction of a famous hero of slavic yore

tragedy and compassion with a wonderfully comic edge there are a great many gay themed films available today but when longtime companion was released it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes something that continues to beset filmmakers even today set during the late s and on into the s the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful before andafter portrait of the devastating effects of the aids virus on a small group of close friends lovers and on the wider gay community very funny extremely moving occasionally upsetting whether you are a gay viewer or not this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit 
walt disney s best movie disney made its mark as a major studio in with its first full length feature film snow white and the seven dwarves ironically given this early success snow white was their only hit movie for the next years world war ii kicked the hell out of disney s overseas markets even movies today regarded as classic disney pinnochio bambi fantasia lost money on initial release disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the us government and the south american films that were part of fdr s good neighbor policy etc stuff that made back its costs but not much more by disney was in dire financial straits they had just enough money for one more movie walt disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn t survive and it would have to be what they did best a full length animated feature film walt said to himself what we need is a movie about a girl in trouble audiences love that they loved snow white that s what he wanted a movie like snow white but even more so more comedy more drama more magic more music more lovable characters he chose as the basis of his company s hail mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world cinderella disney didn t have the money as they had on earlier films to lavishly storyboard every scene thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action then the animators used stills from that as storyboards the photos used survive to this day and many are provided as a special edition extra in some cases these photos have the animator s drawings over them turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in cinderella s family chateau in cinderella was released and was everything disney so desperately needed even today cinderella is arguably the best movie disney s ever made it s just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film the animation artwork was a product of disney s famous nine old men at that time not yet old cinderella pulls off superbly something not particularly easy to do it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work from eric larson and marc davis beautiful and graceful cinderella to ward kimball s wonderful jaq and gus gus the mice and over thetop lucifer the cat everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural part of walt disney s plan to out snow white snow white with cinderella involved its music he very consciously wanted cinderella to be a source of hit songs there had been hit songs from disney films before heigh ho and whistle while you work from snow white when you wish upon a star from pinnochio etc but they d been almost accidental oh we have a hit song well that s nice for cinderella disney for the first time went to tin pan alley th street in new york city where the professional songwriters could be found disney wanted his girl s music done by the very best craftsmen the guys who wrote hit songs for a living the cinderella soundtrack hit big a album with million units sold with songs even today considered quintessential disney most notably a dream is a wish your heart makes from the movie s opening scene the work song while the animals help cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown and bibbidibobbidiboo nominated for an academy award as best movie song of the year from the fairy godmother transformation scene for their best movie disney apparently spared no expense producing the dvd not only has the picture quality been digitally restored but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new surround sound mix totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies cinderella has the distinction of being the noisiest movie ever restored according to its audio crew the original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists a word about the movie s aspect ratio ie how wide the picture is compared to its height the dvd cover says cinderella is presented in its original full screen aspect ratio this is untrue virtually all sound films until including cinderella were since a tv screen is you don t lose a lot when the original is formatted to fit your television i just wish they hadn t lied about it cinderella ends at breakneck pace we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to happily ever after bing bang boom walt disney believed audiences like a happy ending but they don t like a happy ending that goes on too long hey who am i to argue well maybe i ll argue a dvd extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used one of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding cinderella is taken by the grand duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes the first time prince charming sees her since the ball she s not wearing a lovely gown she s wearing her scullery maid outfit cinderella is frightened how will he react when he realizes she s not a fine lady but a poor servant girl and of course he doesn t care how she s dressed he loves her anyway i can see that scene in my mind it would have worked beautifully this is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better 
fun moving with lots of senseless action this movie is one sequence after another set up for one reason to display the martial arts of mark dacascos the plot lame the budget lame the action spectacular the acting from support charcahters like kadeem hardison and a yung brittany murphy as well as john pyper ferguson are just fun dacascos is one of the more exciting martial artists to watch but he garners few quality roles even in movies that he does not get a good role he generally makes the best of it this movie is a great choice fo raction fans silly plot but one great action scene after another bring in the popcorn soda and chips recline and enjoy 
are you gaslighting me recommended when roz asks are you gaslighting me in a first season frasier episode movie buffs instantly recall the tortured paula ingrid bergman in gaslight a movie classic so symbolic that it is immortalized in verb form paula s loyalty and sanity are tested to the limit as the deceitful gregory charles boyer convinces his wife she has no brain at all just like her mother his obsession with gems confiscation of letters and mysterious disappearances in the night coincide with unexplained footsteps and dimming gas lanterns can her would be hero joseph cotten save paula from a fate worse than death the conclusion may appear spellbinding to first time viewers but in retrospect provides sensible vindication each actor plays his part well but bergman delivers considerable emotion in her facial expressions movie quote i am mad i m always losing things and hiding things and i can never find them i don t know where i ve put them 
transformation of a life a masterpiece in short this movie shows how a man who s succesful and rich but lives in a permanent lie suddenly cracks up in a very healthy way and starts from scratch to re evaluate his life his job his feelings toward his wife his father his lover the confrontation between the establishment and someone who just wants to quotlivequot as he puts it is brilliantly depicted elia kazan s genius is very clear here very good acting from kirk douglas faye dunaway and deborah kerr i found interesting similarities between this movie and peter weir s fearless 
un box revisited this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i don t see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in mb bites each hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy 
better than i had expected a couple of good hours of impossible adventure disaster flicks were in their heyday during the s before the days of computerized visual effects the big disaster films at times dazzled with what seemed to be impossible visuals and generated guffaws with some very cheesy effects their fans loved all of it because they never took themselves seriously and it was more like a ride at an amusement park than anything like real life even being scared was about having fun this remake of the original poseidon adventure is much more serious in its intent of course the computer graphics make the images seem incredibly real and that does draw us in we think we feel the heat from the fires the chill of the water the panic of being trapped in the vents our lungs burn for air as we swim underwater with the characters in the movie we don t get the same characters that were in the first movie i won t discuss how the roles map or don t map onto each other but i will say that in making all this more real the director and writers made the people less distinguishable from each other sometimes it is hard to tell who it is that is crying or screaming or whatever kurt russell is terrific as robert ramsey former fireman former mayor of new york i think he is a widower because he has no wife but i don t remember that being explained amid all the noise he is on a cruise with his daughter jennifer emmy rossum and her boyfriend fiance christian mike vogel as always there is tension between the father and daughter and the potential son inlaw at the beginning of the film the dad doesn t know how far along their intentions to get married are josh lucas plays the mysterious dylan johns since learning about this guys is a very interesting part of the movie i don t want to discuss the character or what he does however i do want to say that i loved seeing andre braugher on screen as captain bradford he plays the role with just the right amount of authority that an officer needs to lead people especially in an incredible disaster braugher also plays bradford with enough humanity to endear him to us the rest of the cast i will leave you to discover while they aren t as vividly drawn as they are in the first film they are more compatible with the apparent desire to make such an impossible system seem more realwhile the comments i heard when the movie came out indicated to me that the film wasn t worth seeing i think it more worthwhile than i had thought however you have to take it for what it is it isn t serious and who needs that all the time and it isn t real but it is a good couple of hours of adventure 
best series out there best series out there on any sci fi show makes you think and imagine the worlds out there in the universe this is a good after thought of star trek 
film noir classic this movie is a must see for anyone who loves film noir of the s it s a story told in flashbacks with twists and turns and of course the murky lighting and shadowy imagery that gave the genre the name noir robert mitchum is the quintessence of cool he can do more with a sneer or the raise of an eyebrow than some guys today can do with pages of dialogue jane greer is the doe eyed tomato on the lam kirk douglas is terrific as the heavy you ll love this one 
you must see this movie deneuve beckons they re reshowing this downtown in the west village manhattan as i write this review luckily for us we can see c deneuve in all her beautifully transferred film glory instead of this washed out vhs version which does her no justice still it beats not seeing this movie at all when you see her flawless face framed out from the closeup of her eyes in the opening shot you instantly know why polanski chose her to play the role of carole ledoux because of her beauty you will sympathize with her despite her fatal flaws an incredibly beautiful woman with a womans body yet possessing an immature mind a childs mind equally capable as her sister of satisfying a man s needs yet unlike her sister s sex life this satisfaction is only a one way street when her suitor colin parks in front of her building and tries to make a move on her check out the street sign you can really feel carol s changing persona or rather a revealing of her true persona as time progresses deneuve does a fanatastic job with all the little details half closed lips little turned down mouth showing a kind of sulky poutiness carole can t help the little troubled girl coming out of her who wants her older sister helene to mother and baby her for the rest of her life when helene leaves with her adulterer bf micheal for a roman holiday it s as if the world is crashing down on poor woman child carole she feels completely abandoned esp as an expat isolated in the flats of the mod swinging london of the s what a bad time to be a frigid girl and even worse if you re the poor sod chasing after her heck even the nuns in the local convent who ve taken a vow of celibacy are having more fun than carole who espies them from her window and what s causing all her distress well polanski employs kind of a pop freudian psychology to this tale as if you can look into a person s subconscious through their eyes from the opening shot of her eyes closeup to the last eerie still of an early family photo in belgium it is quite obviously hinted that carole is hiding and repressing some dark secrets her mental undoing figuratively clued in by her obsession with actual cracks and fissures in the walls and sidewalks surrounding her is literally represented on screen as shifting unstable groping hands of the wall and floor come to life to torment her dimension is bent perspective is skewed time sounds and quite disgustingly rotten smells which are hard to convey through film are protocals thrown out by the now schizo carole having gone completely mad yet she is in control in her own way setting her own rules rearranging the apartment and dead bodies as she sees fit hellonly a woman knows how to move furniture and redecorate her apartment for her own needs ! maybe that was her problem have fun enjoy this movie and pick up all the countless clues to her condition along the way btw catherine deneuve is sooooooo godawful gorgeous did i mention that 
awesome a must have for anime comedy fans being a big fan of anime comedy the intelligent yet lame humor i was eager to see el hazard the magnificent world because of the high price of the set i had some hesitation because of some poor reviews on amazon well i have to say that the bad reviews are wrong this dvd series was totally awesome although i admit it started a bit slow i promise the more you keep watching the better it gets the plot is highly intelligent involving dimensional and time travel and the characters are very interesting with distinctive special powers some say the humor in el hazard is juvenile but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark and seriously what good comedy isn t juvenile some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant because many episodes involve a doomsday device to which i respond do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star no ofcourse not yes this dvd set lacks some extras but i think pioneer did a great job the dvd menu presentation is beautiful and the box is very elegant too hopefully you can get this set for around dollars on ebay beware of bootlegs it s very hard to find a good authentic set the sequel alternative world which i just ordered individually should cost around dollars if you shop smart for my fellow anime comedy fans i also reccomend niea under and his and her circumstances animationplotmusiccharacterscomedytotal star 
another poignant view of the holocaust from prague writer jir hubac and director matej minac have created a fine and very different approach to the holocaust stories of ww ii its insidious origins and relentless destruction of a beautiful czech family in the film vsichni moji blzc all my loved ones though the subject matter has been treated in countless films this relating of the story of a large happy well adjusted family in prague and its gradual disintegration does not dwell on atrocities of the camps but instead slowly unwinds the story of how hitler s masterplan overtook and crushed so many innocent people the silbersteins include a physician and his wife and son a brother who is a gypsy of sorts another brother who is a concert violinist and falls in love with a non jew accepted by his family but eventually rejected by her and her family because of the pogrom and all manner of extended family circling in the warmth of the good life in very gradually the nazis take over the czech borders not really heeded by the silbersteins no one could be as mad as hitler may seem and gradually the evacuation and genocide of the jews begins dr silberstein is introduced to an american nicholas winton rupert graves who has come to prague to save the children by providing them safe transport to america the silbersteins reluctantly release their son when they see that is his only hope for survival the remainder of the family s future is doomed the rest of the film deals primarily with the homage to winton showing the real man and the many of the children he rescued it is deeply moving the color and camera work is elegant and very much in keeping with the film s emphasis on the dignity of the silberstein family the acting by this czech troupe is excellent never cloying always sensitive to the very human response to the black cloud of the third reich s holocaust in every way this is a film to treasure highly recommended grady harp september

a flawed masterpiece let s see a remake frank and julia s forbidden love affair was the focus of hellraiser but the cenobites stole the show this time around the cenobites are given a lot more screen time dr channard a man with dark obsessions devotes his life to researching the infernal netherworld kirsty becomes his latest patient at his psychiatric hospital and after hearing of the events that took place in the first movie channard decides to reanimate the evil julia he agrees to bring her victims so she can continue regenerating and in exchange she will be his guide in the labyrinth that is hell christopher young s music is awesome loud dramatic and ominous the movie s theme during the opening credits lets the viewers know what they re getting into his music is also very significant during the scene when tiffany solves the puzzle box the music conveys tiffany s childlike innocence and her sense of wonder as she handles and studies the box the tone and speed of the music as tiffany manipulates the box raises the tension to a fever pitch then after a deafening silence the movie s theme erupts as the gateway to hell is unlocked and the cenobites are once again freed to walk the earth their spectacular entrance in this scene was even more impressive than in the first movie when they appeared after kirsty solved the box this scene is also when pinhead delivers the most important line of hellraiser ii it is not hands that call us it is desire but you need to hear doug bradley s delivery of that line for it to have any affect on you that line may look laughable but it is powerful and so significant because it speaks volumes about the nature of the cenobites it seems the cenobites will not slaughter someone who solves the box unless that person has a desire to see what happens when the box is solved even if that person doesn t know what will happen when the box is solved that would explain why they wanted to torture kirsty in the first movie and since tiffany wanted to solve the box simply for the sake of solving the puzzle she was spared she had no idea anything would happen when she solved the box that raises questions about the nature of the game since the cenobites obviously knew it was channard who called them why didn t they go after him or did they think it was kirsty who called them channard has no qualms at all when he has people killed and yet he is a timid man it is clear that he expects julia to protect him from whatever unknown terrors are lurking in hell channard ultimately finds what he is looking for and pays a painful price there is a cenobite battle in hellraiser ii which was disappointing because it was so one sided there is a reason for this though and in case you don t get it when you watch the movie it s explained on the audio commentary the dvd has an audio commentary by ashley laurence director tony randel and writer peter atkins their commentary was very descriptive and informative they gently poke fun at their mistakes and this makes the commentary more enjoyable lord knows there were some glaring mistakes but did anyone besides me notice the hostility that seems to exist between randel and atkins the thought of them sharing a mutual dislike of each other and grudgingly doing this commentary together gives me perverse pleasure i loved this movie up until kirsty s reunion with frank from that point on this movie goes to hell in a manner of speaking it would have been nice if the script had dropped the dumb subplot of kirsty looking for her father even if that left no reason for the kirsty character to be in this movie it s near the end of the movie when pinhead delivers his infamous line your suffering will be legendary even in hell but even pinhead s wit can t uplift the last half hour of this movie but it was pretty funny to see the patients tearing the hospital apart and just how did they get their hands on all those puzzle boxes a different actress plays the female cenobite in hellraiser ii she is less menacing in this movie but is still entertaining i was glad to see that she still had the bloodlust that was so evident in the first movie but i would have preferred it if she didn t sound so nonchalant when she was talking and i missed the wide eyed stare of the actress from the first movie the chatterer has a different face at one point in hellraiser ii which confused me until i heard the audio commentary personally i preferred the chatterer s original face it was a real surprise when the chatterer s identity was revealed without giving away too much it involves a shocking scene the murder of a child the ending of hellraiser ii made no sense whatsoever but i m guessing that the filmmakers wanted to wait until the sequel to explain what s going on in hell and yes as of this writing i have only seen the first two movies in the hellraiser series hellraiser ii also reveals pinhead s background needless to say i was disappointed i preferred to think of the cenobites as having lovecraftian origins i even dreamed up a whole history and mythology for the cenobites after seeing the first movie ! but i loved the look of dread and despair on pinhead s face right before undergoing his surgery toward the end of the movie you know that if someone like him is fearing for his own safety then he must be in serious danger how the mighty have fallen buy the soundtrack and this dvd so that you can properly savour the first two thirds of this movie 
if only sometimes you watch a film and it inhabits you it gets under your skin ballad of a soldier is such a film and sometimes a work of art provides an affirmation of what you ve always believed this too is the case with this remarkable deeply moving film from kruschev s soviet union the camerawork is exceptional the black and white tonality is exquisite and even though the tale told could be minimalized by labels such as corny and manipulative and obvious at heart it s a classic story of love desperately trying to survive in the midst of madness it s riveting you can t take your eyes off the screen and it s compelling in that during this film and for days after it the most important thing in your heart will become the hero s reuniting with his love deeply moving and i don t know if i will ever forget this performance by the shimmering zhanna prokhorenko the tragedy of this remarkable film is that it could have been used as an instrument to teach the american people they were being sold a lie by their government that lie endlessly hammered into our heads in grade school and junior high was that the russians don t value life like we do we were taught to view the soviets as grey unattractive potato like people in shabby clothing who wanted to conquer main street america though it was never really explained to us why they would ever want to do that especially after losing over million of their own citizens in the last war oh i forgot they don t value life like we do we were taught there was a missile gap with jfk claiming that the russians had thousands of missiles aimed at our back yards which we now know was an enormous and conscious exaggeration sound familiar if every american had had the chance to see this film in the early sixties and had mustered up the inner strength to speak truth to power the contemporary history of the united states and the world just might have been different you could have shown this film to an audience of farmers and their families in kansas in and that audience would have seen themselves on the screen and they would have wept as they left the theatre the soviet people were not our enemies their government definitely at times was our adversary but the demonization of the soviet people by our leaders and our media was and remains absolutely unforgivable a historical sin a brilliant heartwarming and sad film with a profound lesson not too late for the learning 
better than th street i love this movie every year there is a hour marathon on the television of this film and my family and i watch it at least ten times it truly never gets old with us as the characters are authentic and full of good humor it is hysterically funny at times especially when the father receives the leg lamp in the mail and pronounces the word stamped on the box fragile as frageelay huh must be italian ralphie and his family make my family s holiday a lot brighter and we all look forward to watching this movie every year 
penelope ann miller and hormones a ship that was supposed to transport some crates from south america to a museum seems to have a crew that lost their heads the crates finally get flown in one full of goodies the other just leaves the museum s dr margo green penelope ann miller is suspicious everyone else is happy until a guard seems to have misplaced his hypothalamus looks like dr margo green is about to be consumed by her work this is a pretty spiffy well done formula movie as with many contemporary movies they completely ignore the book and add all the standard clichs we have the ruthless rivalry missing scientists and mysterious crates naturally no one does what they are supposed to do and you start rooting for the lets just call it a relic 
plot twists i didn t see coming morgan freeman as alex cross doesnt get much better than that monica potter well look up cute in the dictionary her picture is there anyway this had some serious plot twists that somehow all seemed to make sense as they got tied together morgan freeman continues to demonstrate that he is one of the best actors in film today 
shadows released originally in newly restored this year louis malle s pretty baby gorgeous elevator to the gallows ascenseur pour l echafaud is ultimately more flash than substance many scenes were filmed with natural light shades of dogma and jeanne moreau s penultimate scene walking down the champs elysees light only from the glare of the shop windows that she passes is stunning in its simple shadowy beauty paris in many ways has never looked more beautiful or more sinister the plot revolves around two couples florence carala moreau her paramour julien maurice ronet and two juvenile delinquents veronique yori bertin and louis georges poujouly who steal julien s car the quartet meet only at the conclusion of the film though their actions definitely affect each other earlier there is also intrigue involving julien and florence s husband simon carala jean wall and their participation in war profiteering in the indochina war it is after all but the plot takes a back seat to the mise en scene as malle s camera and the mood take precedence over plot development and plot logic elevator to the gallows a very witty title by theway is at times breathtakingly beautiful to behold decae s moody camerawork and miles davis score and trumpet work are brilliant and as a precursor to the emotional depth flash and profundity of what was soon to arrive elevator to the gallows is an important piece of the wonderful puzzle that was to become the french new wave a few years hence 
wonderful received better off dead right on time quick and will consider buying from in the future thank 
love my dvd i am very happy with my dvd it was in great condition thank yo 
devito miller yup and now on dvd this dvd is of pretty good quality not remastered but normal dvd quality and it is in widescreen format the audio is fine there are no extra features i wondered if this was ever coming out on dvd and why not look at the cast danny devito penelope ann miller gregory peck piper laurie dean stockwell it did well at the box office but then nothing well it s finally here i agree that the match up of danny devito and penelope ann miller seems a bit odd at the beginning but as the movie unfolds you begin to understand the attraction danny s attraction to penelope s character is for obvious reasons but her s are not so obvious however as she gets to know him she finds that in spite of his appearance he is not only rich and powerful but also a smart funny romantic caring person who also provides her with the most powerful aphrodisiac of all he admits he s madly in love with her we all find that very attractive in another person don t we still this movie doesn t provide that usual guy gets the girl ending but leaves it hanging as a possibility since penelope s character in spite of her attraction is still somewhat put off both by his appearance and his profession this is a great movie about the merger and acquisition frenzy of the s and has absolutely stellar acting and writing i also like that penelope s character doesn t mind using her obvious physical assets to her advantage after all if you ve got the smarts to back it up then why not all s fair and so on all inall a very enjoyable movie maybe not for everyone but certainly just right for some and it really points out that you can t judge a book by it s cover 
best documentary out there warning ! this is not for children seeing death real destruction and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on is not for the young with that being said this is the real deal what you probably didn t see on the nightly news great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of new york city that fateful day if you never want to forget what happened the day that changed america you must have this dvd 
zombos closet review tobe hooper who recently did the unsettling dance of the dead episode for masters of horror on showtime as well as the family classic texas chain saw massacre presents a not so pretty picture of carnival life and a somewhat pathetic albeit homicidal monster with a decidedly unhandsome visage and penchant for mayhem the opening of the film is a nod to halloween and psycho two other masterworks of the genre and from there builds into a creepy story revolving around teen lust sleazy carnival characters and a manmade monster that has needs like everyone else but simply cannot satisfy them in more socially acceptable ways a fascinating subtext running through the story is that it is a variation on the tragedy of dr frankenstein and his monster in tobe hooper s tale the monster is one born of genetic mutation cleverly foreshadowed by the freak animals alive tent exhibit where the fetal brother of the monster floats in a jar as an abominable attraction for the hoi polloi indeed in the film s opening sequence the frankenstein monster is carefully shown first as a poster showing the glenn strange characterization my favorite ! and then as a mego doll oh sorry action figure carried by the young boy joey whose sister soon curses him because of his bizarre prank that scares the wits out of her joey s actions are also another subtext running through the film he dons a mask to become a monster that frightens his sister and the actual monster wears a frankenstein mask to become less of a monster and therefore less frightening to others it is interesting to note that unlike the current spate of horror films that feature eye poppingcandy and little else in this film the characters are presented with choices yet consistently make the wrong ones and as we all know in a horror film when you make the wrong choices someone or more likely today everyone winds up dead amy buzz liz ritchie and joey consistently make the wrong choices and suffer the dire consequences in the tale of dr frankenstein and his monstrous creation wrong choices also led to death and disaster but at least here we have the funhouse the funhouse is surrounded by the carnival a seedy grimy affair filled with seedy and grimy denizens there is a bag lady that looks very much like grandmama from the addams family spouting god is watching you a homeless man that wonders around like a zombie a few bums the past her prime fortune teller and palm reader well played by sylvia miles the not so magnificent marco the magician and the barkers three of them superbly played by kevin conway as if he were a natural properly toned by john beal s score and andrew lazlo s cinematography the loud and brightly lit carnival facade hides a darker more primitive underbelly of murderous anarchy and its nexus is the funhouse established by mr hooper s use of two tracking crane shots one at the beginning and one at the ending of the mayhem that emanate from the funhouse to encompass its surroundings our hapless group of monster fodder soon regrets their decision to stay the night in the funhouse and joey soon regrets sneaking out from his bedroom down the trusty trellisbythewindowto visit the carnival we also learn that the father of the monster has regrets about letting it live in a scene that contains a wealth of hinted at backstory but must share responsibility for its actions because of choices he has made dean koontz in his novelization of the film includes this back story the climactic confrontation in the mechanical belly of the funhouse is suitably horrific yet uses little gore and unlike the requisite sequelization antics of many fright films today provides a definitive and satisfying closure unlike the mindless snuff horror approach to today s films the funhouse explores themes and provides a story depth that is worth viewing along with the thrills and chills 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
brian regan first heard his stand up on cd when i worked at borders a few years back sometimes he gets a bit carried away a lotta comics tend to though and his comedy comes across dopey yet easy to relate to clean no naughty words or uncouth situations here ! family fun comedy dirty or clean as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well then he she is funny in my eyes 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
gary cooper the symbol of integrity for many gary cooper was the westerner par excellence cool taciturn courageous and just skilled with a gun but slow to use it gentlemanly generous and shy appealing to men as much as to women this image reached its culmination in high noon with his characterization of marshal will kane the brave and stubborn ex marshal standing alone against the forces of evil and the prototype for countless western heroes ever since highlystylized carefully and beautifully shot high noon possibly owes its great popularity to a combination of three things its a suspense film in the real sense the dearly beloved set piece climax of the gun duel never got better or more thoughtful treatment it has a theme tune that persistently whines its way into the subconscious most people first remember the dimitri tiomkin theme tune then gary cooper stalking down the lonely street the bits and pieces gather from there the film also ties a small town of do nothings showing their cowardice by turning their backs on trouble integrity and an elected representative high noon is also distinguished by many fine images from the incidental the brief close up of the wagon wheel revolving against the town s facades as cooper and kelly leave the community to the poignant zinneman s camera drawing back from cooper s face to show him standing vulnerable and alone in the dust of a deserted main street to the deliberately melodramatic cooper bitterly grinding his marshal s badge in the dirt before riding away for good by means of rapid cross cutting fred zinnemann gives shots repeatedlyof the pendulum of the clock of the empty railroad tracks and in rapid succession shots of tense faces taken at close range of the townsfolk in the church in the local saloon then of the worried face of the marshal his wife and of the three criminals ready for the approaching train high noon is the simple and forceful tale of an aging lawman on his day of retirement and also on his wedding day will kane on a blazing june morning in has just married a pretty young quaker girl the bride feels doubly blessed she s got her man and this is the day he will hang his guns she has firm quaker convictions and never did imagine herself as a lawman s wife but while it s all being celebrated a badly shaken stationmaster ted stanhope bursts in with quite the wrong kind of wedding telegram it states that an outlaw frank miller ian macdonald whom kane had put behind bars six years ago for terrorizing the town has been released the stationmaster adds that three members of his old gang are already awaiting his arrival at the depot their object a reunion with the pardoned man who will get off the train at noon and presumably settle the score with kane the marshal like a sensible man does in fact put his wife in the buggy but then like a man of honor but also a sensible man for the gang will surely hunt them down wherever they go changes his mind and heads the horses back to town a bride especially a quaker bride can t quite see it this way on her wedding day so she hands him her own ultimatum if he won t go away with her she ll go alone by train the one that leaves at twelve everything on this torrid dusty morning therefore hinges on midday therefore kramer s insistence on his clocks from this point onwards high noon although it remains completely classic in western terms faithful to period and concerned with an indicative historical situation takes on wide and profound implications its about group cowardice and short term interest particularly the treachery of so called good people law abiding you feel doesn t mean what it should mean when a group of people decide that they must passively refuse to support the law for reasons of personal preservation who in fact are the outlaws thus the marshal s predicament he is an embarrassment to everyone from judge otto kruger hes leaving town to the humblest citizen of hadleyville only one is ready to give assistance and he melts away when he finds there ll be no other volunteers the marshal s immature deputy lloyd bridges is willing to take over his job again provided cooper leaves town but this is absolute ambition at work the build up of tension as the lawman prepares to meet the four thugs and makes fruitless attempts to recruit help from the cowardly citizens has never been handled better and it is sustained right up to and through the climactic gunfight as the lawman s bride finds herself trapped in the crossfire filmed in black and white high noon is among the ten best westerns ever made the film achieved the shape of a democratic allegory which reached people in much the same way and for the same reasons that the best years of our lives had done its cutting suspense was the hallmark of zinneman s mastery of the movie medium gary cooper s performance as the very vulnerable worried man won him the year s oscar

marvin and lancaster rule i will say right off the bat this is one of the best westerns i have ever seen it is the story of four mercenaries who are hired by a rich cattleman whose wife has been kidnapped by a pancho villa like revolutionary who has taken her across the border into mexico the group is hand picked and includes lee marvin as an ex military man who is demonstrating weapons for the army and who is a former member and mercenary in the mexican revolution himself burt lancaster is his long time buddy and explosives expert who is quite the ladies man and the kind of guy that has to be sprung from jail to actually go on the rescue robert ryan is the more sensitive of the group and handles all the horses woody strode is a jack of all trades bounty hunter who is an expert with a bow and arrow and at tracking jack palance plays the kidnapper and claudia cardinale is the kidnappee ralph bellamy rounds out the cast as the husband and employer of the group this movie is high adventure of the first order but it is not just an action movie the story is excellent and complex and not as cut and dried as you think marvin is excellent as usual and his character has real depth lancaster is burt fn lancaster with the big white smile and with more charisma than any man on the planet this movie is fun and entertaining a great cast a great story great dialogue great locations great cinematography a great score great performances and great directing you can t go wrong with this movie and its not just for western fans 
the other side of love this is a pretty amazing movie that does get graphic in nature and crosses the line in parts of what is art and what is not very good story in which caroline ducey goes out looking for love when her boyfriend sagamore stevenin refuses to pay any attention to her caroline s character finds love in many different forms men and means from picking up a lover at a bar rocco siffredi to finding an older man into s m to having a quickie on a set of stairs by a total stranger which i think is the best segment a great film from catherine breillat also check out her masterpiece anatomy of hell which also stars rocco siffredi 
it almost goes the whole way to perfect this movie was really on track to be an earth shattering experience for us sci fi geeks here s why creeped out techno music not creepy and etherel in itself but creeped out in the sense that everything is angled and black and white in contrast to the driving beat it s incessant and a great effect max s voice overs add to the overall creepiness fantastic concept brilliant really every pattern can be graphed what if you could graph the pattern of nature and discover a secret formula to life max is in it to win it for the sake of knowledge not great stuff tonsosuspense the movie really builds up well almost too well as my one negative comment will show you will get a really strong sense that something of major importance is going to be revealed if you keep watching tripped out lead character complete with hallucinations quirkiness and the obligatory disdain for normal human contact we re talking visions of brains that shriek and vibrating walls the lead character is great if not a little contrived at times by the actor i mean he s getting revelations to the meaning of life the universe and everything by the swirling eddies in his coffee ! yes but i only gave pi stars for a reason the letdown i mentioned that this movie makes you feel like it s building up to something so grand that it may even aid you in your own life i mean i was right there hook line and sinker but i was left on the line at the end the ending isn t bad but it seems like a cop out max solves the problem by drilling a hole in his skull no more special gift no more math at the speed of thought no more secret formula or mystery dang i was disapointed i tried really hard not to be because the movie had me so enthralled but i didn t get the whambam experience i was hoping for at the end however i would highly recomend you checking it out for yourself i ve spoken with a lot of folks who totally disagree with me and dig the ending great addition to your underground sci fi pick it up ste 
a great tell about lbos i really liked this movie for those who like finance and are aware of the stress that it conveys barbarians at the gate shows the intricacies of lbos and also how every business has a strong emotional factor that is many times overlooked 
i served in bosnia with sfor i served in the us army with sfor i think this is an excellent and well done film it is perhaps the most accurate film that i have seen concerning the war in bosnia it not only accurately reflects and shows the genocide that was carried out by slobodan milosevic ratko mladic and rodavan kradzic but it also gives hints but does not quite come out to expose the whole truth as a soldier who served in bosnia i will tell you the whole truth that this film seeks to poke at it shows how the united states acted as accomplices to slobodan milosevic s genocide that was carried out against the bosnian muslim population it plainly shows american officials lying to the american people i would also like to add the former president clinton has seen this movie himself with actor woody harrelson and mr clinton knows full well that he lied to the american people about what was really going on in bosnia to be honest with you it is a truth that must be told i am aching to tell it to everybody i can find i was shocked to see the dead bodies when i was in bosnia and further shocked to discover the lies the us government told the american people i think it is very important for every american to watch this film in order to fully understand the film i highly recommend peter maass s book love they neighbor he reported on the war in bosnia 
there are no other cases this is the case that was paul newman s response to jack warden as warden massages mr newman s back and tries to assuage him by telling him there will be other cases pardon me i always wanted to use the word assuage in a review i live in connecticut and my wife and i drive thru westport regularly on our way to trader joe s i know exactly where mr newman lives i ll never tell and i always kid to my wife i wonder what paul is doing today then i jokingly say that maybe we ll see him at trader joe s grocery store or at mario s great place for lunch or dinner of course if i ever did actually meet him i d be stammering and babbling just like jackie gleason used to do in his old honeymooner s television show but enough of my dreaming so how was the movie sometimes there are events or moments in a movie that stay with you for a long time in this movie those times were there are no other cases this is the case ! and the confrontation mr newman had with the judge when he proclaims i know about you ! as he taps his fingers on the judge s desk classic moments if i ever had a chance to become an actor and had my pick ofacting coaches one of them would be paul newman i m not sure how he does it but somehow after watching him on screen for a few moments i forget he is paul newman and believe he is the character he is portraying i guess that s the magic of great acting they make it look so effortless and now onto jack warden he is perhaps one of the most under rated actors in history a great performance from a great actor back to paul newman the next time you watch one of his movies watch the pauses the times when he s not speaking it s the entire package that makes an actor great it s the phrasing the reaction the eye movements the pauses and how long he holds them sure the director has a lot of input too but just watch him what you are witnessing is a star in action as i write this june paul newman is years old he may be a little slower a little more wrinkled but his acting just gets better with age watch empire falls i truly hope he makes more movies and who knows perhaps one day i will run into him at trader joe s or mario s place and in true jackie gleason form say to him hubba hubba hubba and that my friends will be no act 
excalibur this is the best rendition of excaliber that was ever made i ve watched several and this is the one i prefer above all others it s a great move and suitable for the whole family there is a tad bit of nudity but only a hip and part of a buttock so if your looking for a great movie about king arthur please check this one out 
a should bebetter western fell flat by a deteriorated screenplay it was when the mass hanging scene was stupidly inserted two not just one long church hymns with a cardboard like preacher on the gallows to conduct the crowd to sing them and a condemned byhanging rapist kept monologuing about minuntes to synchronize those two hymns this movie was beginning to fall flat miserably the other ridiculous and illogic part was when the marshal escorted the two young rustlers and that murderer back to where the hanging judge resided why he suddenly had to take a route across a vast desert instead of going back by the original path where the posse came from there s no way and no excuse to make such stupid arrangement simply just because the director and the screenplay writers wanted to show how difficult and tough the marshal got to do a heroic dead manwalking mission then turned himself out for the next lame a herowasborn scene there were wonderful moments of this film but it started to drag along and lag behind gradually it often gave you an impression that both the screen writers and the director didn t have a clue how to make this movie going they could only asked clint eastwood the marshal to do lot of unnecessary hollow scenes 
no harm no foul at first glance this would appear to be a very serious movie the opening hour or so reminded me of the movie body shots which is a rather disturbing film what is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon what you end up with is something totally different than what you think you re getting in the beginning reese witherspoon stars once again as a sort of young girl lost type persona she seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in twilight and freeway while the present film is not quite as off thewall as freeway it is still pretty far out in left fieldif you re a fan of reese witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of the twilight zone this one might be for you while there are many obvious clues during the film as to what s going on i did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation can you 
i got what i ordered flesh gordon is a funny and slightly naughty take off on the old flash gordon serials i ordered the dvd it arrived quickly amazon did its job just fine nothing more to say

well done movie with some language mix ups successful in describing what cuba is all about this film is also about life it made me think that not only in this writer s case but great writings or other creative works were made in prison there is something about prison that can force us grasp the nature of life or perhaps it can also be said that nothing can kill truly liberal mind in the movie english was spoken among cubans in cuba whereas suddenly they start speaking spanish without translation i find it very annoying it makes a perfect sense if they spoke spanish in cuban prison and start speaking english after he left cuba i live in miami and am surrounded by thousands of cubans so i know that cubans in cuba do not typically speak english to have conversations among themselves i don t mind subtitles while the scene was in cuba and i wish what was what they did unfortunately this language mix up is the reason why i cannot give stars 
south pacific is terrific i was most pleased with the new upgraded remastered quality of this classic musical the color and content were beautiful and clear the extras were every interesting and entertaining worth the great price

sentimental favorite when my daughter was born a relative and i wound up reminiscing about this album and how much we both loved it growing up next thing i knew a copy of the dvd arrived as a gift for my daughter and me the first time i sat down and watched it brought back all my memories of being a little girl in the s i could even still sing along with the title song ! right now my daughter is too young to do much except listen as i sing or play music for her but i hope she grows up enjoying these songs as much as i did yes the visuals are dated but i believe the messages of these songs are as pertinent now as they were thirty years ago best of all the songs get their messages across without being preachy i think this is a fabulous alternative to much of what s out there for kids today and dated as some elements may be free to be you and me is still a long long way from going out of style 
see how good a movie can be since the storylines of this fourteen yearold film must surely be well known let me say that the piano one of my favorite movies is a unique production whose makers went out of their way to truly give it the appearance of the mid nineteenthcentury it strolls forward with an anti modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of new zealand and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre electronic era in which it is set the quality of the visuals is heightened by the performances given by holly hunter sam neill harvey keitel and most especially anna paquin whose skillful portrayal here won her an oscar at the tender age of eleven the plot of the piano is highly unusual even unique for filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the s who went from scotland to the most remote of british colonies in order to marry a stranger for this woman to be one whose self imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano im daunted by the courage of those who brought the piano into reality for the wealth of feeling in its story for its setting for its cast and for its sheer brave inimitability it is a fine motion picture 
enjoyable sexy and dark mitchum stars in a noir film that specifically suits his reticent subversive style out of the past is true to the noir genre the plot an unusually savvy detective is set up as a chump by the femme fatale he falls for her only to be used in her machinations to gain power and money ultimately he refuses to be manipulated anymore and participates in her downfall in this film we also see the potential for this character if he falls for an honest woman who can be lovingly believe in him but the deeds of his past catch up with him happily ever after is not in the cards this film was filmed in gorgeous black and white meticulously framed in each shot whether capturing a closeup of gorgeous mitchum and greer or stunning location shots in san francisco the rockies and mexico this is mitchum in his prime right before the he was busted for marijuana enjoyable sexy and dark 
uncle buck rocks uncle buck is absolutely hilarious and no better actor then john candy to play this role ! uncle buck is a slobby unorganized middle aged man and is asked by his brother to stay over his house so he can take care of his kids while he and his wife are out of town visiting her sick father even though uncle buck seems like a careless slob we get to see his paternal side as we see how he actually really cares for each of these children best scenes are the ones where he has to look after the oldest child who is a rebellious teenage girl also starring in this film is a very young macaluay culkin and gaby hoffman as the younger children this movie is a classic and i totally recommend it ! not to mention that it s a john hughes film 
one of the greatest films of all time vittorio de sica s highly acclaimed film bicycle thieves called for years in america the bicycle thief is now presented in a superb transfer by the criterion collection the film was released in and won a special academy award the best foreign film category didn t exist yet and has lived on in great movie books and top movies of all time lists astoundingly due to all its accolades is a very simple film it was made during the times of italian neo realism and many of the actors in the film aren t professional actors including the lead role of antonio played by lamberto maggiorani the setting is rome where jobs are scarce and many of the people live in poverty antonio s luck changes for the better when he finally gets a job hanging posters of rita hayworth up around town problem is he needs a bicycle he tells the man who gives him the job that he has one but the truth is he just pawned it to get food for his wife and two children in order to retrieve his bike his wife sells their bedsheets and antonio sets off to make some money then suddenly his bicycle his stolen and his whole world comes crashing down unable to do his job he notifies the police who tell him that they can do nothing about it so he begins walking the streets of rome with his son trying to find it that s pretty much it but the movie in all of its simplicity is so much more poetic and important despite not being a professional actor maggiorani gives one of the most memorable performances i ve ever seen even the boy who plays his young son is unforgettable the movie is filled with great scenes such as the moment where antonio spots the man who stole his bicycle and attempts to get it back only to have the entire neighborhood gang up on him then there are the final scenes where we realize that the actual title of the film bicycle thieves is much more appropriate than the bicycle thief to say bicycle thieves is a masterpiece would be an understatement many movies can be called masterpieces but few films really embody the wonder of cinema this movie is important well made on all levels it has aged well and it s entertaining we know that the latter doesn t always happen in great movies anyone who wants to begin watching films that have shaped cinema over the course of the years can start anywhere from citizen kane to breathless to jules and jim to pulp fiction those films are all good to start with but at some point you must see bicycle thieves grade 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods

the very best there s so much to preview in this show that to share it all would take a couple of pages however the highlights are the music the singers and the dance flatley is incredible and the show flows like a river pardon the pun it is superbly choreographed and executed and it goes from the serene to the sensational in a split second the orchestrations are touching and the irish celtic music is haunting as are the costumes this is theatre at its very best and it is highly recommended i d give it stars if i could ! 
violent and rough i saw this one when it came out i remember at the time that it savaged by the critics as too violent i saw it again recently on tv and i remembered that comment and laugh you see this came out in the middle of the italian westerns the italian westerns were beginnig to turn to violence to keep the audience that they had started with the dollar movies american westerns were just trying to survive so they looked to the italians for help jericho was more violent than what us westerns were but not violent enough for the italian western audience this caused this one to die which was a shame jericho had good blood lines the story was based on a al cody novel and had very cool actors in martin and peppard the story is tight and the characters are well drawn and the violence well later american movies and american audiences took to violence with black ganster moview and biker movies god for bid that someone try to change the american western jericho today is a very good western and one must keep in mind the time in which it was made when they watch it for you see it is also a time capsule of american movie history too 
a white cat after viewing wag the dog i can say that i did in fact enjoy watching it but i m not wholly sure why well lets start with a few problems i had with it to give my head a chance to think it over one more time my main beef with this film is that at some times the plot drags along a little too slow without hardly anything happening or much keeping you distracted until a plot twist came into effect i also have to say that i thought their choice for background music quite odd for what the movie was based on the music used although hardly used makes the whole thing seem light hearted or like a fairly tale which for this movie is bad because the whole idea of it is to make he viewer question what the media tells you and music like that just makes it a little harder to believe anyway i really liked the idea of not even including the president as a character in the movie he was just heard from the other end of the phone saying dumb things like that cat should defiantly be white or it sounds too corny that adds to the main reason i enjoyed this movie its unconventional yet still effective it doesn t really fit into one given genre so i have to slap the broad drama comedy label onto it which makes it difficult to compare to other movies of the aforementioned genres what i mean by that is that i couldn t recommend this to a fan of comedy or drama because it ends up being a mix of both so if you a genre buff you probably won t enjoy wag the dog but people with an open mind will however be able to see past the need of having a genre plastered on everything and enjoy this movie for what it is the acting is as expected from just a star studded cast that includes such big names as robert de niro dustin hoffman dennis leary and willie nelson i don t know how much better you could expect the acting in a movie to be of course its really hoffman and di niro who shine in this movie they work well off each other making you forget who they are in real life and think of them as stanley motss and conrad brean all in all i would recommend wag the dog to anyone who enjoys movies comedies satires and or people who just enjoy a new idea or plot take it from someone who has only ever really enjoyed a handful of movies in their life you should see this movie 
one of the best criterion dvd sets i own i ve owned the original criterion version of seven samurai it was nice owning this fantastic movie especially since it had the criterion stamp when the new disc version came out i read numerous reviews stating how much of an improvement it was from the first edition and i am in full agreement i ve never written a review for amazon com before but i feel compelled because of how impressed i am with these dvds criterion has really cleaned up this new version it blows the older version away it looks like it was filmed yesterday the extras are really awesome and the booklet is nice and informative this is the definitive edition of this wonderful movie and kurosawa s masterpiece well worth the money

and the band played on i received this product on time and in perfect shape i enjoy the high quality of amazon s site 
a black comedy of espionage and exquisite manners one of james mason s best films picture the results of the normandy invasion if the germans had known in advance that the second front would take place there in early june it turns out they did know and they didn t believe the information was true note that elements of the plot are discussed ulysses diallo james mason is the valet to the british ambassador to neutral turkey in he has perfect manners he is invaluable to the ambassador he is trusted diallo was born in albania but came to england at an early age determined to become an english gentlemen he decided that the best way to learn was to become an english gentleman s gentleman i may not be a gentleman yet he tells countess anna staviska danielle darrieux one evening after she slaps his face but i am the best gentleman s gentleman the countess has lost her husband and her wealth in the war and now is an increasingly poor but highly attractive woman who is willing to serve the germans or the english for money in ankara full of intrigue and agents there are always opportunities diallo had also at one time been gentleman s gentleman to her husband diallo decides he can make very large sums of money by photographing secret documents the ambassador keeps in the embassy safe to which diallo has access and giving them to the germans he will insist on being paid in english pounds sterling he estimates over a period of a few weeks he ll have enough funds to live the life of a gentleman in rio de janeiro he recruits the countess to help him to be his banker in exchange for funds he will pay her and as the days go by their arrangement extends to her bed the german s pay but they aren t sure of the man they have code named cicero the information appears to be too good to be true they suspect a british trick the british now begin to suspect there is a leak in the embassy they send a man from london to find out things get dicey but diallo makes one last theft and is almost caught by the british after turning over the photographs and getting his money he also barely escapes from german agents who now want him too what was his last batch of documents he photographed and turned over to the germans specific information on normandy the information was so big and came from a source so unlikely a valet that the germans didn t believe it and took no action this is a true story as for diallo well he didn t care whether the germans believed him or not as long as they paid he didn t even care what the documents contained as long as they were stamped top secret but at the end of the movie dining in his dinner jacket on the terrace of his sumptuous rio villa served by a discrete gentleman s gentleman of his own he is visited by his banker and a senior brazilian police officer diallo had already learned that it wasn t wise to trust the countess now he is about to he learn he shouldn t have trusted the germans espionage may be the name of the game here but the movie is really a black comedy of exquisite manners no one could read a line of dialogue with the mixture of cool contempt and self amusement the way james mason could he is utterly self possessed even when he is taken off guard as the countess manages to do he recovers quickly with a shrug mason s diallo is a complete mercenary so amused by life that he becomes a captivating villain danielle darrieux almost matches him in the countess determination to reach her former social position they make a fine selfish wary couple joseph mankiewicz directed the movie the screenplay is credited to michael wilson although imdb lists mankiewicz as an uncredited screenwriter the dialogue is full of mankiewicz style amused cynicism the movie is available in vhs as well as a region dvd the dvd looks just fine there are no extras the time is long overdue for this movie to appear in a region dvd 
awesome a must have for anime comedy fans being a big fan of anime comedy the intelligent yet lame humor i was eager to see el hazard the magnificent world because of the high price of the set i had some hesitation because of some poor reviews on amazon well i have to say that the bad reviews are wrong this dvd series was totally awesome although i admit it started a bit slow i promise the more you keep watching the better it gets the plot is highly intelligent involving dimensional and time travel and the characters are very interesting with distinctive special powers some say the humor in el hazard is juvenile but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark and seriously what good comedy isn t juvenile some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant because many episodes involve a doomsday device to which i respond do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star no ofcourse not yes this dvd set lacks some extras but i think pioneer did a great job the dvd menu presentation is beautiful and the box is very elegant too hopefully you can get this set for around dollars on ebay beware of bootlegs it s very hard to find a good authentic set the sequel alternative world which i just ordered individually should cost around dollars if you shop smart for my fellow anime comedy fans i also reccomend niea under and his and her circumstances animationplotmusiccharacterscomedytotal star 
seeing is believing i saw this video onboard the sailboat le ponant just prior to entering the panama canal the video was incredible and allowed each of us to better understand the magnitude and complexity of the project david mccullough does a fantastic job of commentary 
i believed all of it movies plays and books are all subjective endeavors the idea is to suspend your disbelief while reading or watching the piece in the case of beautiful thing that is not hard to do from the opening frame you want jamey to thrive he hates pe because the macho guys pick on him as they start a game of soccer the english call it football he jumps the fence and heads home skipping pe for the umpteenth time who can blame him and when a school chum s ste s homelife with his brother and father takes an abusive turn jamey s mother rescues him on those nights and the two teens form a bond that goes well beyond friendship as the two guys struggle to deal with their love and erotic feelings for each other the music of mama cass elliott plays in the background the story and the music is an enchanting combination that intensifies your urge to see them make it as a couple you know they are young but not too young you wish that had happened to you when you were their age earlier reviews have already mentioned the terrific supporting cast as well as the two leads in this story so i won t go into that here instead i want you to see the dvd so you can experience the feeling i felt at the end of the movie when jamey and ste begin a slow dance in the street in full view of their neighbors unlike a few of my friends who dismissed this scene as unrealistic in a poor working class neighborhood i chose to suspend my disbelief and each time i watch it i mouth the word yes 
for keeps this is really one of my favorite molly ringwald movies of course all of them great this one stands out a lil more its a more serious role of something thats happening everyday i was also excited this came to dvd i give her alot of props for this one

gripping and intensive yes it is a documentary and yes it is a monologue yes he discusses the sex trade in cambodia which is extemely explicit but this is about cambodia this is about the killing fields this is about our involvement in that history there is nothing gratuitous gray is captivating as he sits on a darkened stage with his words and topics accented with strategic lighting maps sounds and video clips you will leave this film with a new understanding of what happened from cambodia to kent state he also has a unique insight into mankind in this his quottalking cure quot you will be compelled to try to answer the question that he wrestles with is morality a moving feast this is an important film

i am fire he is water ! how can we ever meet for all its low reputation samuel bronston s much mocked king of kings is easily the best and most intelligent of the devotional versions of the life of christ largely because it sets jesus as a historical figure and to a degree a victim of history and politics in troubled times more importantly it manages to do it without being as relentlessly dreary and one note as george stevens the greatest story ever told which becomes more of an endurance test with each passing year even the vigorously staged battle scenes serve a real dramatic purpose pitting barabbas davidic warrior would be messiah against jesus spiritual deliverer i am fire he is water how can we ever meet that is many ways the real conflict of the film the fight between material pragmatism the romans herod barabbas and spiritual idealism jesus and his followers even caiphas is given a very modern reading not as a black hearted villain but as an unpopular roman appointed religious leader who genuinely cares for his flock fearing that jesus popularity could be used by the romans to start a holocaust that will destroy his people theres much imagination at work too while jeffrey hunter s messiah suffers from mgm s insistence on redubbing the part in more masterful tones he proactively interacts with the crowd in the sermon on the mount played almost like a press conference while the last supper takes its visual design not from da vinci but from the cnd s peace symbol the casting is variable robert ryan s john the baptist hurd hatfield s pontius pilate harry guardino s barabbas ron randell s centurion guy rolfe s caiphas and gregoire aslan and the great frank thring as herod sr and jr are fine but rip torn is surprisingly awkward as an otherwise well conceived judas iscariot doomed by compromise royal dano s simon peter is a better idea on paper than onscreen particularly when given dialog and siobhan mckenna s eminently punchable misty eyed mary is a tad too oirish catlic for my tastes yet despite its weaknesses and the virtual sidelining of jesus for much of the running time this is more a film about his times and his effect on those around him than his life it s never less than totally involving and often genuinely moving despite reputedly losing interest in post production nicholas ray s direction is excellent his mastery of the wide screen making great use of the mm format and showing real inspiration in his handling of some of the miracles scenes greatly enhanced by miklos rozsa s superlative score even ray bradbury s poetic narration beautifully delivered by orson welles originally intended as a quick fix to paper over the cracks in the narrative genuinely adds to the film s complex political picture of an occupied territory not that some of the cracks aren t still visible as in the meaningful exchange of looks on the temple steps between jesus and richard johnson whose constantly changing part one day a freed gladiator the next an arab the next a romanized jew was otherwise totally deleted but they re minor complaints in an extraordinary epic that achieves more of its ambitions than its given credit for incidentally how on earth did they get the obscene graffiti on the barracks walls past the censors in less obvious on the dvd copy you can t miss it on the mm prints warners dvd is a beautiful transfer and unlike mgm uas slightly cropped laserdisc issue in the correct aspect ratio extras are thin though a teaser trailer and brief newsreel footage 
it s a mad mad mad mad dvd it s a mad mad mad mad world is one of the all time classic comedies it may lose something in translation to the younger set who is used to far more vulgar comedy but this truly was a brilliant film for it s time if anything it gives people who have not seen the film an opportunity to witness some of the funniest comedians and actors of that era a bunch of strangers played by an all star cast by happenstance find out about dollars in hidden treasure and race to fictitious santa rosita state park ca to find it under a big w the fun of course is in what happens to them on the way i recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh jonathan winters was the robin williams of the sixties and the scene where he single handedly levels a service station is priceless if the chase scene had an origin it was probably from this film for it s time and without the use of computers the auto chases and other stunts are amazing to me mad mad world is the comfort food of cinema 
christy i have of the christy videos in spanish i love them and would like to know how many are in spanish and how many videos are there total does christy marry who did not show who she decided to marry i would love to know ! thanks 
facing the inevitable when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully samuel johnsonmichael keaton gives an effective and heart felt performance as bob jones a young successful pr executive married to a beautiful woman nicole kidman who is expecting their first child the bottom falls out of his life when he is diagnosed with a fatal illness and only given months to live he is forced to exam his life that he s really just been rushing through bob jones not only has never stopped to smell the roses he hasn t even noticed that they are there at all my life is a realistic portrayl of what must go through one s mind when one is brought up short by such stunning news although the topic is certainly depressing it is something we will all one day face this is how one man deals with the terribly bad hand he has been delt especially poignant is the fact that not only won t he probably be around to help raise his child but he might not even make it long enough to see his child born heart wrenchingin several pivotal scenes jones decides to hope for a miracle and visits an asian healer haing ngor who starred in the killing fields who tells him that he has too much anger and hurt in him jones resists the whole notion of exploring how he got to where he is at least for a while his anger at his family is one point of anger he must struggle with keaton does an excellent job here we see flashes of the actor we saw in mr mom and earlier movies sort of a lovable good hearted guy with a funny edge to him his bob jones evolves slowly and realistically from a man who is stunned and angry to a man determined to let his child know who he is ngor also plays the right note as a practioner who can t cure his patient but perhaps can help him in his last journey a potentially maudlin down beat subject is handled with just the right amount of empathy and gentleness and with a light touch highly recommended very highly recommended if you ve had such a scare are living with a terminal illness or have had a loved one deal with such issues 
classic musical given the star treatment some of the re writes for this movie are a bit hard to take while the new opening is a little hard to take it does establish the animosity between fred and lily quite well it also makes too darned hot acceptable censored lyrics are not awful but they rob porter of some of his depth katherine grayson rises to the occasion quite well her early scene is contrived but after that she s on firm footing howard keel is wonderful his acting is just a tad square but that was in part the format of the time ann miller dances up a storm and speaking of dancing what a treat to have carol haney bob fosse and bobby van as featured dancers there isn t really a complete rendition of another openin another show and bianca is cut entirely but the rest of the numbers come through great why stars partially because of the cuts but also the color has just a little fluctuation at times this isn t a restored print but it isn t bad either i wish they had a few more of the d excerpts in the special stuff i also with they sent some d glasses 
torn i like the actors they got for this movie and i think the acting done in it is well done however if you are a mark wahlberg fan as i am then this movie might not be high on your list in this movie mark gets captured and tortured it may seem odd that it would be my reasoning for not liking this movie but its one thing for them to just kill a character but i am not a big fan of watching them torture mark ! i would tell you to watch it atleast once to see what you think of it but be warned that the scene is in there 
about bloody time praise the lord beckett on dvd this was and is a supreme movie two dynamos of the english stage screen at the peak of their abilities i loved this movie since it was first released i have owned it on vhs for over years the only sad thing seems to be that it is not letterboxed like the vhs is i guess i can live with that as a matter of fact it is one of the two reasons i have kept my vcr the other reason is the nondirectors cut of blade runner the one with commentary now if only ridley would cough up a nondirectors version of blade runner i can get rid of the old thing 
review of stand and deliver i received the dvd in a timely manner the quality of the dvd was good i have had good service from amazon overall it was a good experience and a good product 
joan shines in spruced up classic crawford fans already know that while this movie was a famous flop for joan it contains one of her most interesting performances now they can see it struck from a near immaculate print and enjoy both the gorgeous cinematography and those wild closeups of joan a friend of mine who is not a crawford fan described her look in this movie as quotmakeup poisoning quot personally i love joan s characterization of south seas prostitute sadie thompson highly stylized it s a little ridiuclous but compelling in her quotredeemedquot scenes sadie is quite moving and stunningly beautiful ! this was crawford at her peak sadie s ascent up the staircase to confront walter houston s lustful preacher is brilliantly handled and has to be one of joan s best confrontation scenes ever ranking right up there with mildred slapping veda a little talky and slow in spots but the rewards are worth the wait 
goodness has so little fictional value i love films which unfold complexities slowly that use color with deep intention and don t rely on words to say everything that must be said the end of the affair is a lovingly and carefully adapted film to fit into time i feel that you must allow a film like this to stand on its own many adjustments were made to the story and what eventually emmerges is to me even more cohesive and personal one thing i particularly love about the end of the affair is the color pallette and sharp attention to clothing i love sarah s red suits her green jacket her hair carefully suited to the time and the way the colors stand out but with subtlety from every scene that she stands in until her character begins to fade this movie permanently affected my aesthetic sensibilities the most affecting aspect of the movie for me however was being able to deeply relate to the character of sarah as i think many people can most of us have our superstitions even when we work to keep them subdued and certainly a seemingly miraculous experience or great trauma they usually go together don t they can bring those things to the surface i thought that the bendrix and henry dynamic that played out in the film was fascinating it created a contrast between two ways of living really one figure content to live on a straight line climbing little by little with bits of satisfaction but no passion and the other all passion and anger and intensity henry in a way created the passion sarah felt for maurice he bottled her up and placed her on a shelf where she simmered and i think the vulgar sex scenes as some called them are extraordinarily necessary if you want to understand the emotions going on then again sarah s religious devotion followed her commitment to henry which before the vow she seemed to have no intention of lessening so you also see that she was more than the sensual person that she was with maurice she was also the practical wife neither was a role she was playing every central character in this film is a dichotomy and more than that they are wonderfully and spectacularly flawed which certainly is the core of graham greene s insightful and philosophic writing this is a labrynth of a film rich in unanswerable questions and contains the most brilliant use of perspective that i have ever seen if you like me like to watch a good film several times i recommend listening to neil jordan s commentary along with at least one viewing then watching it again stephanie 
funny funnyfunny even though this is about years old it is extremely halarious i ve been waiting to see a good stand up comedy the first min is just one hilarious hit after another i love this guy

underrated entertaining this is a fine movie that was unfairly panned by critics there is some clumsiness to it the use of flashbacks towards the end doesn t work they seem as thought they were originally written and filmed to be an earlier part of the narrative and then placed at the end to keep the earlier part of the narrative going at the snappy exciting pace it is in the final movie and to add a little of that during the final part which after horn is arrested moves at a slower pace but the movie is still well made well acted and plenty entertaining this is a revisionist western that doesn t downplay well doesn t downplay excessively horns stature as a killer of men in the movie horn isn t reluctant to fire the first shot or to keep shooting after a man is down when one of the cattle rustlers tries to ambush him in town for example horn shoots him and as the man is lying in the mud probably mortally wounded horn unnecessarily shoots him again in the film it is this incident that moves the cattlemen who employ him to sell him out horn comes off as something of a hapless easily manipulated rube in the movie which it seems very unlikely he could have been and still be as cagey as he was he s an idiot savant of sorts a man remarkably gifted when it comes to killing people but inept at living in the civilized world when he learns that he is being accused of killing the nickell boy not only does he diligently avoid proclaiming his own innocence he goes out of his way at his own trial to annoy everyone and cast even more suspicion on himself we remain sympathetic to horn though when we see him kill he s always killing men much much worse than himself the world is not a worse place for their departure and he s a helluva shot we americans love a great shot 
love story secondary this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it is certainly a love story but for me this is only important in that love is one of the things most of us look for in life the deeper search and this is where asia a character starts out is for a life that is not frayed at the edges perhaps another way of saying whole what plays out is two people driven in part for certain by their passion for each other but even more for their passion for authenticity who deepen themselve each other and an amazing relationship through that search it is the insistence of each of these people to fully honor themselves individually that causes them to succeed both in their personal quest and in love it is they way they ultimately honor each other this is a deep life lesson that is not learned by many which perhaps is why so many reviewers miss it what they learn is that when they find themselves they can t take that away from me as the music that accompanies the credits at the end says a fantastic flic good music color cinematography acting editing and other things too 
this is one of the saddest most painful films i ve ever seen i thought i had it bad on the set of my little student film in college whewwatching this documentary was very difficult and very interesting at the same time i enjoyed it despite the tragedy that played out on the screen what makes the film so heartbreaking is that you know that the film will inevitably fail so the entire movie watching experience is steeped in dramatic irony we the viewers know the outcome of this ill fated film project known as the man who killed don quixote but the filmmakers themselves at the time of the filming obviously do not know that all their actions are essentially in vain a great film and a powerful warning to those who thinking making movies is easy 
definetely eirie the film keeps you at the edge of your seat if you ve never seen it you ll like it just the thought of an intelligent alien life form manipulating tapping into circuitry and recking havoc is disturbing enough pretty cool sci fi s movie definetely an eirie one 
carmen jones i was so impressed as a teenager when i first saw this movie that since then the opera carmen has been my very favourite music the story is set in the us during ww instead of spain the film has an all negro cast with some wonderful voices it is colourful and exciting patricia longrig 
review of day abs daily short abdominal routines was a great idea from the firm ! this one is comprised of segemtns from five of the original total body volumes this tape is great if you want to just do ab work every day or to add extra abdominal work to any of your workouts it includes very classic and traditional moves as opposed to the moves in the other ab video more day abs these sets however are a lot of fun and also produce great results 
used to teach i used this movie as part of my hispanic heritage month october lesson in the classroom we did a study of jaime escalante and salvador dali the children really enjoyed the movie we just watched the classroom scenes teachers version of editing for content and time while i explained what was happening my class loved it and so did i 
a poignant masterpiece there are very few films that have literally brought tears to my eyes they must be films of uncompromising emotional power films like magnolia the passion of the christ and now johnny belinda it is the story of a deaf and dumb young woman named belinda treated as an unintelligent workhorse all her years belinda s life changes forever when a lonely new doctor moves into her small coastal nova scotian port town he takes an immediate liking to her and proving to her family that she is not the dummy they think he teaches her to read lips but after a drunken sexual assault leaves her pregnant rumors begin to fly throughout the small town and both belinda and her loved ones must fight for what s right the performances are wonderful of course jane wyman simply steals the show in her oscar winning performance she brings an incredible heart warmth and emotional resonance to the character of belinda and she does it without ever saying a word the rest of the cast is marvelous as well especially charles bickford who lovingly portrays belinda s father and stephen mcnally who turns belinda s attacker into one of the most easy to loathe characters ever put on celluloid yet the film still brilliantly keeps him at the level of a realistic personality no one is a caricature director jean negulesco brings an understated visual beauty to the film reminiscent of the silent ages when one had to use aesthetics to make up for the lack of aural stimulus every shot is a perfectly composed work of art turning every moment of belinda into a masterwork of lighting and raw majestic nature the seaside settings are utilized so well that they put johnny belinda in league with such legendary jaw droppers as l avventura and black narcissus but this film is much more than just visual appeal it is both heartwarming and heartbreaking often simultaneously there are so many thought provoking themes to gnaw on in johnny belinda the way people view the handicapped the bonds of parenthood the power of rumors the justification of violence as self defense and overall morality and humanity even the film s setting could be considered an allegory on belinda the brutal waves of the ocean constantly pounding against the serene shores the film is also as i mentioned before emotionally overwhelming while it certainly has a focused narrative belinda is foremost a progression of feelings and they are so well conveyed that i was simply overcome with joy pain heartbreak and hope while the film is often described as a melodrama it is far from a soap opera there are no miraculous moments of sudden verbal triumph for belinda no ridiculously overacted moments of teary eyed abandon johnny belinda is a terribly real experience there are aspects of the story that remain unresolved not loose ends but difficult problems that would most likely also remain unresolved in reality however i don t want to give the impression that johnny belinda is depressing i felt uplifted and rapturous just as often as i felt overcome by grief and fear i felt so much for these characters and i wanted so sorely for things to turn out a certain way but i won t reveal whether they do or not i will say that the film ends on a note of nearly unbearable poignancy and this is the moment that massaged my tear ducts my only complaint concerning the film is max steiner s score he is perfectly suited for epic films like king kong and gone with the wind but here it feels somewhat overdramatic and occasionally awkward he tends to play up the melodramatic angle and spot score in a ubiquitous manner which simply doesn t fit with a film like johnny belinda still it tends to work more often than not and it is not a major enough problem to work seriously to the film s detriment this picture is a true gem it has been unavailable for years but thanks to warner brothers it finally has a dvd release and the restoration is simply glorious it more than does justice to this cinematic treasure do yourself a favor and see johnny belinda 
sadness and beauty the princess of death loved one man which is not allowed beautiful sounds enhance the beautiful scenes and lead you into the world consists of love death and life the princess of death sacrificed herself for orphee in the end i cannot forget the final scene that she leaves

re animate me i m another one of those reviewers who saw this hilarious film in the s and fell in love with it this dvd with it s many bonuses has a special place on my shelf it never gets dusty there i consider this a classic spoof that stands the test of time 
still entertaining after years just as entertaining as it was years ago john adams opening line one useless man is a disgrace two are a law firm and three or more are a congress is still one of my all time favorites 
it just doesn t get any better than this this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old grainy vhs versions i hadn t seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time it s one of those rare perfect storms of comedy where great writing truly funny line after truly funny line is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time dudley moore got an oscar nomination for arthur but lost although john gielgud won for best supporting actor if moore s performance in arthur doesn t win a best actor oscar its proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title another example is gene wilder in young frankenstein steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm hearted tone of the story quite simply imho the movie is a rare gem it s only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after arthur was released regarding the dvd it s so so although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies there is still no widescreen version available the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it s just not enough one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included because they were hysterical but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit the dvd being the perfect format to include such material certainly should have offered it as well this the original arthur is a classic comedy that is one for the books 
a woman of her word while this film did not hit me as hard emotionally as the english patient it sure gave me plenty to think about the cast and direction are first rate the story is well told it made me buy the novel and read it and then wonder how much of the story really happened if you enjoy intelligent challenging love stories told against historical backdrops then check this movie out and be very careful what you ask god for 
ronny yu s masterpiesce now as long as you know hong kong films you know that they are like all low budget and therefore are really hit and miss this is a definite hit the beautiful brigitte lin is i guess a girl who was raised by wolves and she works for this evil cult she helps a young boy and she ends up later being his lover now when i review my absolute favorites i usually just go off on the keyboard but nobody i know has ever seen this movie in omaha nebraska we don t get all these movies at a chinatown store and my best buy store has like nothing that it shows on it s website therefore i need to go to places like amazon and ebay to get the movies i want it really sucks so i will make sure i don t give anything away cause i would feel absolutely horrible but i will tell you a few things to look for that made this a classic for me brigitte lin she is hotter than ever in this movie but not nearly just that after seeing this the first time the bide became my favorite woman character ever and that goes for all genres of all countries movies and all tv shows for that matter she gives such a powerful performance and i will just say that when the white hair comes in to place you will feel her pain the director just did a brilliant job with everything wudang kid showing off sword technique this is a scene you will always remember it is so beautiful this shot alone makes this movie very unique and the kids sword skills aren t too bad either the twins you will never foget these the camerawork the cinematography is just astonashing i saw a reviewer complain about thi but it is another thing that makes this unique stunning the acting you are not gonna get much better acting than this other than a goofy character who was very good everyone s acting is brilliant now the version i recieved was not the special edition but i don t buy dvd s for the special features but then again it would have been really nice to hear the ronny yu commentary not just cause he speaks perfect english and i wouldn t have to read somebody s translation of ronny s speech but because we just don t get many of these commentaries i mean wouldn t it be cool to hear like jet li on fist of legend donnie yen on drunken tai chi or woo oing on iron monkey but anyway the picture quality is very good not good for a film but still good it s widesreened and has sound that rocks so you can t beat that the music is sweet i bought this used over amazon so if you buy it directly from them you may get the special edition but i have now learned ot ask before you buy

an outstanding movie this movie based on michael shaara s book the killer angels is over four hours long but it uses that time well to document this critical civil war battle i used the word document on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary it was even filmed at the gettysburg national military park when you see the fight for little round top or pickett s charge or another fight you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened thousands of civil war re enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle these amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows as a high school history teacher i was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class when i timed pickett s charge i realized it is shown in real time those confederate soldiers charged into union gunfire for minutes and you see every moment in this movie read the killer angels and then see this outstanding movie kyle prat 
wow i loved this movie it is great funny the animation war great great for every on 
passive aggressive behavior effects fabulously acted books on passive aggressive behavior often refer the reader to the movie gaslight where passive aggressive behavior and its effects are splendidly acted by a cast of old time movie greats the term gaslighting attempting to drive someone crazy by hiding things and other psychologically coercive behavior originates from this movie set in victorian england husband gregory anton charles boyer uses a variety of techniques to convince his wife paula ingrid bergman that she s crazy smooth talking intensely romantic gregory does a fine job of sweeping ingrid bergman s character off her feet and convincing her to marry him after only two weeks they move into the victorian townhouse she inherited from her famous opera star aunt who had been murdered there when paula was a teenager there the self absorbed gregory uses a variety of psychological tricks to drive paula crazy tricks still in use today like isolating her from visitors commenting under the guise of concern that she s tired and forgetful hiding jewelry etc he even tries to make her think the house is haunted ingrid bergman does a brilliant job of playing the distressed paula who increasingly doubts her own sanity and is driven to the brink of nervous breakdown gaslight showcases bergman s acting better than casablanca filmed two years prior bergman and boyer are helped by a fine cast of supporting actors they have an intensely curious busybody old woman neighbor played by dame mae whitty who snoops on them as much as she can while she gardens or feeds the pigeons she reminded me of angela lansbury in the television show murder she wrote whitty born in was a london stage actress beginning in the s who found hollywood success in her s ! another fine supporting actress was the feisty cockney accented young maid my friend with whom i watched the movie whose review appears elsewhere on page and i were sure we had seen her somewhere before in a variety of roles turns out she was a teenage angela lansbury in her movie debut a role that earned her a best supporting actress nomination and showed that this woman was born to act ! another fine supporting actor was joseph cotten who played scotland yard investigator brian cameron its really a tossup as to whether to give this movie four or five stars i m giving it four stars only because the movie has a slow beginning setting up the story that some modern movie viewers might find a bit boring no spoilers but this is one movie where it s well worth sticking around for the second half and the ending you will be well rewarded for any boredom you may have endured during the first half 
the last vestiges of the old west steve mcqueen is his pentultimate role before succumbing to cancer stars in the somber biographical film tom horn horn a legendary cowboy indian scout and wizard with a rifle rides his way into wyoming territory near the turn of the th century cattle rancher john coble played in an effective measured fashion by western veteran richard farnsworth recognizes his talent and hires horn to work on his ranch he introduces him to the local cattleman s association which was been plagued by rustling they give him free reign and backing by the local marshall joe belle to rid the territory of the cattle thieves by whatever means deemed appropriate including death the association soon tire of horn s violent techniques and plan to get rid of him they railroad him without the backing of farnsworth by accusing him of the murder of an innocent local youth who had been herding sheep a sham trial is convened to convict him of murder the story of tom horn is representative of the transformation in our country from the days of the old west horn is symbolic of an era that no longer fits within the shrinking frontier horn love interest a school teacher played by linda evans also forsakes him unwilling to be seduced into his now obsolete violent lifestyle the movie serves as a sad commentary on society s unwillingness to allow freedom and equality for those that don t fit a prescribed mold in a changing world mcqueen and farnsworth were naturals for their respective roles slim pickens playing sheriff sam creedmore as usual gives an authentic portrayal of a denizen of these times 
actors upstaged by some beautiful hot cars i sometimes wonder about the mentality of geek scriptwriters in hollywood it seems like one of these nerds thought lets make a movie about lotsa cars being stolen this is because the cars thief s brother is in trouble well that s about the entire plot of this movie cars get stolen but no pedestrians are killed which would have made this movie rawther sordid i do believe once again hollywood has made a movie which glorifies criminal activity angelina looks good as always but even she can t save this turkey of a movie if you have seen one hollywood car chase then you have seen them all 
supercop this film really should be called police story supercop but anyway in this film jackie s sidekick is michelle yoeh james bond s sidekick in tomorrow never dies together they pose as bad guys to infiltrate the drug gang and go undercover to destroy the operation from the jungles of thailand to the city streets of malaysia jackie battles the bad guys in some of the most spectacular stunts yet ! jackie won a best actor award highlight when jackie jumps from a building to a rope ladder hanging from a helicopter great film 
very compelling film when i first saw this movie i really didn t know what to think its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for enjoyment that being said i love this movie and here s why it s a true story it is extremely patriotic even if it s patriotism displayed by the wrong country how can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country this was well produced in my opinion and i feel the only flaw was harrison ford playing a russian if you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing but i appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
nail on the head i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson i had never really seen topher grace outside of that s show which i never kept up with on a regular basis i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd mr grace plays a year old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend he s become such a machine in a competivie world that he s loses his way in life i was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too one of mentor s has told me repeatedly that the mid twenties can be one of the roughest times in life so many things are going at once on so many levels to me this movie captured that paul weitz did a great job writing this the cast was exquisite 
a thriller with character and originality billy bob co wrote and stars in this tightly woven deeply textured well written off beat thriller about a couple of drug dealers heading from ca to ak combines the personal the interpersonal the deviant with an unusual love story embedded craftily in the middle this was on roger ebert s top ten list the year it came out although there are a couple of plot flaws it works well enough to keep you anticipating the showdown because these seem to be authentic people trapped in a tragic destiny this is a rare type of film nowadays the kind that comes from the heart not from the sterile factories of m fa programs and lunkhead studios 
lighten up people cmon people lighten up i m not a big fan of musicals but this is a good movie i do agree the use of colored filters was grossly overworked it s like garlic a little is a little good a lot is not a lot of good and the director definitely over did it but to criticize rossano brazzi s accent because it was italian instead of french is being quite picky he was supposed to lend a certain continental air to his role and he did and musicals are supposed to be fantasies of a sort so you have to use some imagination if you want realism you shouldn t look to a musical after all how many times have you been around a group of people in real life who suddenly broke into song and dance all perfectly choreographed of course the thing i found absolutely dumb dumb dumb was the anti racism message i thought it was hokey in when i first saw this movie and i still do neither incident made sense first we have sweet and petite nellie forbush from little rock ar falling in love with a frenchman but when she finds out he was once married to a native woman now deceased and the two kids she adores were the native woman s a racist streak a mile wide goes up her spine kinda hard to believe even for then there is lt joe cable from philadelphia pa he meets and falls instantly if not sooner in love with an absolutely gorgeous native girl he sweeps her into his arms sings younger than springtime and kisses her later he makes other visits to her and they swim in a swimming hole hugging and kissing underwater there not being any jewelry stores on the islands he gives her his family heirloom watch that his father and grandfather carried in prior wars now one would naturally think this was leading up to a marriage proposal and it did but not by cable by liat s mother he suddenly realizes guess what her eyes are slanted and their children will have slanted eyes ! dang that racist streak although these inconsistencies don t make sense to me perhaps i should use my imagination after all it is a musical the one thing i found offensive is the notion that only whites can be racists but that s hollywood always beating up on its own who made it rich i checked this movie out of the local library you might check yours if you decide to watch it i m not sure i d buy it 
my all time favorite comedy this movie has it all wonderful humor social commentary and noone can beat the comedic skills of the incredible cast please check out the scene of roland young being carried out of the hotel by the ghosts the movie really asks the question quotwhats life all about quot and comes up with a terribly unpc answer 
the best movie in the world this was the best movie i have ever seen but i hated the end it depressed me for days because i wanted them to be together it is still my favorite movie cuba gooding jr is the sexiest man he is a very good actor and moira kelly is a good actress you can tell they are because you could feel the love between the two characters and they didn t even have to say i love you i really wish the end had been different i wanted them to make love so bad he should have escaped with her or they should have found a cure and then they could have lived happily ever after and had a baby and i hated when willie died the end of that movie made me so mad i don t see how she could go on without him they should have made love no matter what they were very good together they should do another movie together i love that movie so much but when i watch it i have the video it leaves me depressed for days but it s still the best 
nice and awesome i absolutely love atlantis from ronon dex to sheppard and to all the faces i d cry if atlantis was cancelled seriously though steve should have never have died he should also have been put in command of sg can you imagine that why steve welcome to earth youre welcome to live out your life if you only feed in self defense on enemies kay oh you re also in charge of sg p but seriously the wraith make this show so awesome from steve to bob to edward to gordon and alexander to michael and eric by far james s best performance yet the wraith make this show what it is but one thing why don t we have before i sleep seriously you have no idea how irked i am at that since i began watching in s anyways i think atlantis totally pwns sg

a christmas classic for every season there is a classic movie in our house a christmas story tops the list when christmas rolls around without a doubt this movie is a classic ! ralphie and his quest for the red ryder bb gun i do love this movie 
my phat white uggly old year sandled man foot i was an innocent babe of when this movie came out and only just discovered it ironically when i was back in ha ! asside from the appearence of people plastiface surgury done right most less intelligent people in particular a real life plasti face on some fox show that had so much stuff on her face and body she could barely speak though had nothing to say is the reality of it you cannot be someone you aren t and if you do you run the risk of being frankenstien s monster she was in real life my brother s college classmate wanted a big chin over his mousey face and so now has a plastic pile ocrapola under his neck ha ! for being so stupid i say this movie is actually a walk in the park compared to what is happening today and shows the future is sooner than one realises the nasty nineties which i adored became the neat nspiffy st century sharply ascending zippers and high strung people who struggle to hide thier uggly character el demon that is new york city git u rope of course this movie showa coloaklial s term is in a ultra modern environment nowadays that is an obsolete term replaced with post modern with a method of escape in the rural countryside of hell the domes remenscent of dr who s genisis of the daleks kalide citedel is a beautifully done symbol of the future that is not the earth we know today or america we knew in typical ss mentality of actually having a place to escape from the hum drum pretty boiez school but what evah ! farienhieght playes out exactly the same in reality their will be no escape from a totalitarian scociety those in charge are too cleaver and the rest of us too stupid duh end 
strawberry fields and mickey rourke forever for the longest time i ve steered clear from this movie because i once overheard my mother say to her friend oh my god i had to walk out in the middle of this filthy movie because it had no respect for food that was sometime in a few years ago i thought i d be rebellious and watch the movie anyway hell my mom didn t have to know plus i was definately old enough on the contrary to my initially biased impression this movie for some reason wasn t as blatantly filthy to me as how my mother described rather it was an interesting story about a woman captivated in a torturous love affair that was ever so consuming and how she managed to free herself from an addiction to a numb lover who was equivalent to a cruel child in other words i really liked it and for the record i still have no problems eating strawberries then again who with vision can say no to pre surgery mickey rourke 
pink floyd pulse this is the best of pink floyd i just keep watching it over and over great dvd 
great show bad dvd i loved the davy crockett televised series as a kid but these left a bit to be desired the picture sometimes goes to a sepia tone and other times it loses its color contrast it also get super fast in some places it looks like it was hodgepodge together from different lesser quality sources also on parts do not play well the story is great and so is the packaging but the quality of the dvd leaves something to be desired however if a full original copy has been lost to time this is better then nothing 
a great film but a slightly disappointing dvd from criterion le samourai jean pierre melville s riff on this gun for hire is another of criterion s slightly disappointing recent discs the film is superb and the extras are okay but not outstanding melville trying a little too hard not to blame rival studios for the fire that destroyed his own studio during filming is the highlight but the transfer while acceptable is nowhere near the standard of the deleted french dvd or even the russian one for that matter both of which are much sharper it s still a great exercise in pure filmmaking but i m glad i didn t trade in the french pal disc which boasts superior picture quality before seeing this transfer 
the up side of our country regardless of how disenchanted one might become with its politics its politicians or its policies a film like this restores one s faith in what our country has to offer its young people even if you happen to think the sort of ruthless competition that goes on in this film is another strike against us as a country there s still something very moving about a child being nationally recognized and celebrated for the size of her vocabulary rather than her socio economic background social skills or appearance in a place saturated by the influence of beautiful people valued often for nothing else its refreshing to see the child with the braces and the bad haircut hold up a trophy that comes up to his chest and walk away with enough money to see him through his first year of college beyond that this movie is delightfully nerve wracking suspenseful and full of surprises its as entertaining as it is important 
nice and awesome i absolutely love atlantis from ronon dex to sheppard and to all the faces i d cry if atlantis was cancelled seriously though steve should have never have died he should also have been put in command of sg can you imagine that why steve welcome to earth youre welcome to live out your life if you only feed in self defense on enemies kay oh you re also in charge of sg p but seriously the wraith make this show so awesome from steve to bob to edward to gordon and alexander to michael and eric by far james s best performance yet the wraith make this show what it is but one thing why don t we have before i sleep seriously you have no idea how irked i am at that since i began watching in s anyways i think atlantis totally pwns sg 
good couples movie this is a very good movie for a couple to watch heart touching 
women of the covered typewriter ginger won the oscar for playing this part despite some stiff competition she s decidedly out of character as a white collar girl with an old school attitude i love when she grumbles people always make a big deal about the old west and the brave women of the covered wagons they don t seem to care as much about their modern day equivalents the secretaries the women of the covered typewriters with her quivering lower lip and her turned up chin she makes us care for kitty foyle a girl from the poor side of the tracks who makes good with the rich playboy wynnewood strafford the iii or for short win played skillfully by the wonderful dennis morgan possibly hollywood s most under rated star player of the s morgan could sing too but he was best playing men whose love for their leading lady was always tested by some kind of addiction or other handicap some sort of weakness here his achilles heel is his family and their swanky social position gladys cooper would have a fit if she found out that dennis was dating ginger rogers and in the book of course kitty and win don t get married but carry on a back street sex affair anyhow moviegoers even in s were agile enough to read between the lines and to guess that the baby ginger loses in the movie was a real love child you d have to have a heart of stone not to feel strangle prickles behind your eyes like tears when ginger realizes that she has lost the baby luckily dr mark is there to pick up the pieces james craig another very good actor playing a young intern who loves kitty even despite the fact that her father s a boozehound and she will never enter the social register or main line philly society i wonder if grace kelly ever saw kitty foyle and based some of her choices in men on kitty s philadelphia binary between this film and bachelor mother you would think ginger rogers a very maternal figure but anyone who met her in real life knew that there was no room for children in her heart in some ways she was a very lonely lady despite her many accomplishments and all the famous men she attracted to her side think lady in the dark probably the part she played that was the most like the real life ginger rogers the subtitle of this movie was the natural history of a woman and was supposed to provide a quasi scientific or sociological study of class far from it but it s a treat anyhow 
this dvd release fills me with inertia bedazzled is my personal favorite film and although it is not always laugh outloud funny it consistently surprises the viewer with its wit and theological discussions regarding the nature of the feud between god and the devil the plot involves the plight of stanley moon played to nerdy perfection by dudley moore who works at wimpy s hamburger stand and longs after his co worker margaret spencer eleanor bron after reviewing his personal situation in life moon decides that suicide is his only option at the last second the devil walks in played by peter cook at his best and offers stanley seven wishes in exchange for his soul hopefully this dvd will do this film justice with some nice special features at the very least it gives the viewer an intriguing option to the woefully mediocre remake and remember the magic words julie andrews ! 
rikki tikkitavi and kotick too many people remember the mongoose that saved the garden from the wicked cobras but some forget the equally charming white seal that saved his kind from the seal hunters by leading them to the secret island the same man who brought kipling s quotrikkitikkitaviquot to television chuck jones has also breathed life into another kipling work quotthe white seal quot the results are the same chuck jones has produced two animated classics that the whole family will enjoy so set aside a special family night and watch kipling s stories come to life it will be time well spent 
gets better everytime i watch i just love this movie but it may not be for all since it is a very specific type of humor don t expect best in show or waiting for gufman because this is not a mockumentary but rather a really funny movie about the ups and downs in hollywood and may i add very on point i just love it more and more and wish guest would direct another one this funny in love with both emily longstreth and teri hatcher i can t pcik which one so i ll choose both 
four rooms dvd this movie is a classic especially for those who love tim roth 
don t analyze just watch do not try to apply western thinking to asian movies ! they are not done with the same intent or even at times for the same purpose these movies go deep into culture and you have to go with it to enjoy what goes on this movie has good action and fantastic plot lines ! i searched until i found it i like wire fu and prefer it to real kung fu movies because i like to escape butterfly and sword will take you places you haven t likely been before 
a classic story that s worth your attention as much as i adored the original version of this film with albert finney and aileen quinn i am not the type of person who instantly shuns remakes i love the story of annie and was very excited to see a new version when this first came out in the s annie flick had a specific passion and energy that pretty much cannot be equalled by anything but this remake has something special going for it partly because of what many other reviewers here have indicated it follows the broadway musical production much more closely than the undoubtedly fabricated fluff from the original this movie tells the famous story in a lighthearted and simple fashion without going overboard with the music and dance numbers and that is one important factor that can reel in younger viewers better this time around really the only thing i didn t particularly love about this film was the acting alicia morton is adorable you can also catch her all grown up as the middle school mean girl in the lifetime movie odd girl out but she lacks the mental and physical toughness that made aileen quinn s performance such a knockout morton is too soft spoken in her role and she seems to be reciting lines more than she emotes in front of the camera but for the movie it still works okay kathy bates performance was arguably one of the biggest mistakes we all know what kind of character miss hannigan is and bates portrayed her as a relatively nice woman whose biggest problem with the little orphans seemed to be just getting a little annoyed with them from time to time victor garber is a terrific actor and i enjoyed him in this movie but he didn t show oliver warbucks typical transition from gruffness to having his heart melted by little annie the woman in the role of grace farrell probably did the best job she was kind sensitive and just loved annie her performance was right on target in this film s defense maybe their reason for toning down the demeanors of some of these main characters was to keep it a light easy and enjoyable movie for children in that sense i think kids will like it better than the original because it just tells the story from annie s viewpoint and keeps a youthful innocent glow to it so even if you are very loyal to the original this is certainly something worth examining with an open mind if nothing else you get a sweet classic story in a fresh new perspective 
city of lost children though canny at times this movie is an excellent example of french cinematography in the fantasy scifi realm the story has twists and turns with unforgetable characters on the curve of every loop and keeps the viewer entranced defintetly a fantastic movie for anyone that appreciated such films as mirror mask the labrynth and pan s labrynth for that matter and the dark crystal for those that haven t been exposed to this type of genre one may find a new door into these cult films of a different dimension and into a new mindset 
stolen dignity in italy s classic movie the bicycle thief sociology and story come together as one for post world war ii italians convincing and with heart we experience the pain of antonio ricci lamberti maggiorani as he becomes one of the lucky few to get a decent paying job he is to put up posters throughout rome using a broom and adhesive if you ve been there like i have you notice that the city has bulletins and posters pastered all over their ancient walls to work he must have a bicycle he has one but it is broken determined he accepts but he hasn t the money for repairs his wife sells their linen to pay the bicycle repair shop all is set and his life has a whole new outlook until a thief steals his bicycle while he s on the job he chases him even hitching on a car to no avail he has a friend who takes him downtown and we see a whole market of bicycles some of which undoubtedly have been stolen the vast majority of the movie focuses on him and his young son bruno enzo staiola as he goes to every corner of rome to recover what misfortune fatefully handed to him in human form containing for then a non hollywood ending and sporting perceptive social commentary a bicycle thief comes off as a post depression grapes of wrath for urban italy it gets us there by easily providing empathy for the characters and telling a simple but solid story

the straight story inexpressibly moving story of an old man who is determined to set things right with a brother he has not spoken to in years while there is still time it is a film about the goodness in everyday people and how it surmounts the pain and and evil that every life encounters it tells of gentle triumph over the inevitability of life s end and the aging that precedes it especially suitable for older viewers or anyone with sensitivity to the process of aging 
no one does physical comedy better than keaton no one these were two of the most amazing and creative films i have seen in months buster keaton wrote directed acted and did all his own stunts in these two films he even did stunts for a lot of the other actors in these films too our hospitality is the story of a feud between two families that reaches a crisis point when keaton falls in love with a daughter in the other family in sherlock jr keaton plays an aspiring detective and movie projectionist who dreams that he is a famous and skilled detective not only are these two films engaging well made and interesting they are funny i go weeks sometimes without laughing at a sitcom or a movie that is supposed to be a comedy i found myself laughing out loud numerous times during this film there are some classic scenes that just stand out when you watch these movies the whole floating down the river scene at the end of our hospitality is jaw dropping these have got to be some of the most dangerous stunts ever attempted in sherlock jr there is a pool game where every ball on the table is bounced around except for one which is miraculously untouched there is the harrowing motorcycle ride there is the escape from the gangsters i could go on an on these films are like live action bugs bunny cartoon there were several occasions where as i was watching these movies trying to anticipate what was going to happen next i said to myself no way he s not really going to do that that s not even possible no sane man would attempt a stunt like that and yet he does there are about or scenes from both of these films which are completely seared into my brain that isn t an easy thing to do most films don t have one memorable scene and to have a single film with or of these scenes is nothing short of amazing they just don t make filmmakers like buster keaton anymore i wish i knew where his creativity came from if directors today could channel even a fraction of the skill that keaton exhibited cinema would be an amazing and wonderful place 
funny slightly surreal comedy on the merger of east and west germany if you don t mind reading subtitles or of course you understand german this movie is great some of the humor is visual some verbal so you have to be good with subtitle reading the humor is subtle that is to say it is tongue in cheek not slapstick it is not a political film though it presents itself in a political context the r rating is not really deserved there is a little nudity but there is nothing shocking in the movie it is a nice view into the lives of east germans during the early chaotic days of integration i dare say life now in east germany is more brutal and more cynical k 
one of the best documentaries ever made i saw this documentary in the s and it opened my eyes every human being on this earth should see this documentary and rethink it s role in human history noam chomsky is a model humam but a model 
rivette who is jacques rivette he s a great filmmaker that s who the french new wave is justifiably famous in cinema circles schools etc it is still talked about today when they mention the filmmakers that came from that school of filmmaking they mention jean luc godard eric rohmer and francois truffault rarely if ever do they mention jacques rivette when a friend of mine asked me my favorite french directors i said robert bresson jean luc godard and jacques rivette my friend said rivette jacques rivette s films stand out from any other french filmmaker of his time the other french new wave filmmakers were prolific whereas rivette would make a film every few years rivette s films are generally very long the most extreme example being the film out which runs hours his other films run on average hours and concern themselves with the artistic process this is a hour film slightly longer than most rivette films but not the longest but it unfolds magisterially and beautifully i saw it in a theater with an intermission and i was entralled it is one of rivette s best films and one that really shows the agony of artistic creation creating art is a long and arduous process kubrick compared his art filmmaking to trying to write war and peace in a bumpy car ride but when you ve finished it s an amazing feeling its pacing is very slow and leisurely but there isn t anything wrong with that i didn t feel bored and i didn t feel that the film needed to be cut it s perfect the way it is the title is translated a pretty nuisance for those who are curious this film really captures that on a completely unrelated sidenote i remember seeing this film with couples in front of me the women liked it but the men were bored out of their minds one kept shifting his head back and forth throughout the whole thing the men were probably just hoping to get laid afterwards so that s why they went to see it you should really only see this film if you re a committed art cinema person luckily i am this is one of rivette s best films and he s a filmmaker that deserves to be better known 
that s what you get for being a fan i own the first two volumes of the lost treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat they are brilliant and i hope more volumes appear on a regular basis why though must i suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get the plays volume without buying them all over again i suspect and hope that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime i can only say that if you don t already own any of these and are a fan of broadway theatre or the performing arts in general buy this today ! a fantastic showcase of theatrical talent 
explains a great deal i read uncle tom s cabin a few years ago and was genuinely touched i saw immediately why it became one of the most influential books in the history of our country and possibly the world the story of uncle tom is sure to leave you changed whether you are black or white racist or humanitarian it really explains how different people viewed the institution of slavery after reading this book many die hard proponents of slavery gave up defending it and abollitionists were fired up more than ever before if you read only books this year let uncle tom s cabin be one of them you ll never look at slavery us history or the plight of black people the same 
a film you have to fully understand evolution to fully get having read tons of books and articles on the subject of evolution i understand this film very much i know some who understand evolution far less well will certainly be confused by the intricate plot concerning the big e as for other complaints by amazon reviewers i ll say this i find the acting in this film anything but hollywood like this film reminds me a lot of fatal attraction and other rather realistic s hit films this movie had very realistic acting the dialogue in this movie has profanity true but it is delivered in a very sophisticated educated and realistic way not cheap like in s rambo movies realize most of the characters are professors and doctors and such therefore it is extra cerebral dialogue blair brown is much sexier than william hurt hurt s character in a big scene goes back to the beginning of mankind and discovers how without love a little anger happiness and otheremotions life is unbeliavably drab indifferent and purely a technicality that s why he quits the search why do so many insist it s a cheap ending hurt s character quits happily embracing earlier stages of mankind upon realizing that man is not actually ultimately god and as just a single cell there s no feeling at all no control etc for people people are better off in their current multi celled state therefore he successfully fights all regressions off in the end a power he really had all along because it is no good and this realization makes him appreciate his loving and sexy wife all the more hurt s character goes to mexico not south america like some posters think 
kipling gets a classic treatment i had never seen this movie and i dont know why ! freddie bartholomew topbilled as a teen is an obnoxious rich kid who falls overboard and is rescued by portuguese fisherman spencer tracy over the next few months a bond forms between the two that is both honest and touching a terrific olio of pathos comedy melodrama and good common sense make victor flemings adaptation of the rudyard kipling novel which im embarrassed to admit i never read one of the best movies ive seen great supporting work by lionel barrymore john carradine mickey rooney melvyn douglas more and freddie is quite the beauty here a winner ! 
murky atmospheric western saga robert altman s mccabe and mrs miller is a gloomy subdued tale of the old west filmed with magnificent cinematography in the pacific northwest warren beatty playing dimwitted gambler john mccabe ambles into a remote burgeoning frontier town nestled in the snowy confines of washington state at the turn of the century he has an idea to build a gambling hall and saloon also housing a bordello soon the stunning julie christie a shrewd opium smoking madam from seattle arrives in town with her sharp business acumen she forges a partnership with beatty and their business begins to boom the town receives a surprise visit from the representatives of a mining company who make beatty a lucrative offer to sell his property for the mining rights when he refuses a trio of gunslingers arrive in town to kill him and seize his possessions the drama plays out in a blinding snowstorm as beatty is pursued by the pack of gunmen at the same time the town church has caught fire occupying the townfolk who are unaware of the conflict being played out altmans somber classic is a more realistic portrayal of frontier life than what hollywood has traditionally churned out previously both christie who was oscar nominated and beatty did fine jobs of acting in their roles 
great quality there is a good reason you d want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality isn t very good it s streamed and the bitrate quality is low personally i want to watch survivor on my plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider 
a ton of cheese what i loved about this movie and the tv show was that adam west burt ward and the rest of the cast played it completely straight it s so campy and over the top but they were never self conscious about what they were doing they weren t being ironic or detached that s one of the main reasons why the show worked so well of course the dialogue and situations here have to be seen and heard to be believed my favorite is the dolphin who sacrifices his life so that batman and robin may live a ton of cheese but really good cheese 
beautifully filmed noir piece i really like this film first of all it is absolutely beautiful to look at tahoe and water water everywhere all sumptuously photographed the story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children intense often suspensful and sometimes creepy this is a keeper swinton is amazing here like one raw jangling nerve she is amazing to watch the rest of the cast is fine their roles whether shady clueless or sympathetic well worth a view 
depth one well fusioned album with a lot of depth ! mira niar did know l subramaniam would give a strong backbone to her movie no doubt about that ! like the album conversations have not words to express the brilliance of this one but the fact i give it stars and not is cause there is no flow to the album you have other pieces which is not l subramaniam kinda coming in the way of the album but hey ! this guy does know what he comes up with ! he sure is not given the due credit he reminds me of another mozart quiet shy but his music is power and we don t really know it until the maker is gone way too much over the top huh let his music speak 
perfect love makes perfection in all i find it odd that when reviewing the reviews of this film that people seem to either give it perfect or abysmal scores the dichotomy of opinion is probably a direct result of the skill and immense power of leconte s images especially those that his chosen actress affords us leconte is a master and quite possibly the greatest living auteur currently making films his movies often contain a refreshing difficulty that gives one hope that images still mean something that film is still worthy of being explicated that someone still cares enough to think that much without being overly clever such as the coens and anderson i shouldn t say still i should say is and will be as leconte is on a different level than any who has ever worked including kieslowski the master of images i enjoy how leconte has said that although it was his second period piece he approached the film as if that had nothing to do with it learning from ridicule i should point that out i have no problem with ridicule and the fact that it is a period piece has a great deal to do with the presentation but i can see what he meant like i said i enjoy the statement but i should also point out i m a jerk binoche and auteuil are two of my favorite actors and this film shows them at their virtuosic best they deliver amazing performances of a truly passionate couple who both hold unconditional love for the other which in itself contains ultimate trust of decision and character possibly more auteuil s for binoche s but the sympathy generated by his character fuels her as an equally sharing partner making any difference negligible there is a third character neel but he is there only to accentuate the relationship between the other two the movie quite simply is about unconditional love and what it means to love unconditionally there is a subplot of equal merits mainly concerning neel about the belief in redemption and what it truly means to believe in redemption in short it is about the consequences of action through belief more so out of the love for another than those of moral ground or stance some people are not willing to accept the belief that actions can or should occur solely out of sympathy for another some people will never allow themselves to love unconditionally some people will not understand or even like this film binoche deserves a prize that doesn t yet exist for her most exquisite performance leconte deserves recognition for what he has done and what he has given us with this film certainly one of the best i have ever seen 
im never more witty than when i ve had a little nip i did some checking and i discovered this film the spiral staircase originally released in has been remade a few times over the years once in with eddie albert hayley mills elizabeth montgomery and gig young a made for tv feature again in with jacqueline bisset christopher plummer and john phillip law a full length feature this time and then yet again in with nicollette sheridan and judd nelson this last one also a made for tv feature sounds like a real winner adapted from the novel some must watch by ethel lina white and directed robert siodmak the killers criss cross the crimson pirate the film stars the demure beautiful and extremely talented dorothy mcguire three coins in the fountain old yeller swiss family robinson also appearing is george brent the corpse came c od fbi girl kent smith cat people the curse of the cat people rhonda fleming a connecticut yankee in king arthur s court gordon oliver jezebel elsa lanchester bride of frankenstein murder by death sara allgood dr jekyll and mr hyde rhys williams how green was my valley james bell i walked with a zombie and ethel barrymore who won an oscar in her previous supporting role in the cary grant film none but the lonely heart the film set at the turn of the century begins with the murder of a woman at a hotel one where a crowd of people just happen to be in attendance of an old timey picture show the kind where a pianist plays the accompanying score including helen mcguire a mute woman who works as a servant for a local well to do family around this time we learn the murder is not an isolated incident as someone is stalking women with physical infirmities and doing way with them the woman in the hotel had a severe limp dr parry smith who has a keen interest in helen and her condition makes the scene and offers her a ride home but halfway there he s called away so helen must walk the rest of the way and it seems along with the darkness and a menacing figure lurking about a storm is coming in more ways than one once helen arrives at her place of employment a very large manor owned by a family named warren we meet a whole slew of interesting characters there s professor warren brent his secretary blanche fleming the professor s playboy half brother stephen oliver who s just returned from a long european trip their bedridden mother mrs warren barrymore mrs oates lanchester the cook her husband williams and finally nurse barker allgood as the storm outside continues to build so does the ominous sense of danger due in part to mrs warren s continual insistences helen leave the house as soon as possible as she seems to have serious doubts about helen s safety one couldn t blame her given her sons one a smarmy mouth ne erdowell the other a bookish fop there s safety in numbers but as various members of the household are called away for whatever reason helen soon discovers she probably should have listened to mrs warren and got while the gettin was good i enjoyed this film a lot especially in terms of the huge slightly creepy manor which most of the story took place the distinctive shadows darkened corridors elaborate sets pieces combined with masterful directing featuring some strong and off putting killer point of view shots and spooky musical scoring all went a long way towards creating an overall eerie atmosphere a continual sense of evil present as right from the beginning that and the fact we knew from early on the killer followed helen home and gained entry into the house the characters are very distinctive and played expertly by a highly professional cast the real standouts being dorothy mcguire who has practically no speaking lines throughout the film and must rely solely on her expressionistic abilities and also ethel barrymore as the infirmed but certainly not mentally impaired mrs warren once a woman of great strength now confined to her bed by afflictions brought on by advanced age she was actually nominated for an oscar in her role here the one thing that really gave me the heebie jeebies as far as this film went was ms barrymore as she would often seem to be feigning sleep but then you d look over at her and her eyes would be wide open taking in everything that was going on bette davis may have had peepers distinctive enough for kim carnes to pen a song about but ethel barrymore certainly could have given her a run for the money that and the fact the words bette davis comes across much better in a song than the words ethel barrymore and talking about eyes the killer was often displayed only in much abbreviated form hands a foot etc but usually by a close up of one wide glaring eye full of murderous intent as far as the identity of the killer it was really anyone s game up until a certain point and by then the writers wisely saw no point in keeping it a mystery anymore as most everyone should have gotten clued in by then i did pick up on it a little earlier than i expected but only because of the not entirely subtle pushing of other characters as suspects drove me to my own conclusions as to the motive behind the murders that aspect did remain secret until it was revealed i suppose one might be able to discern it before the reveal but i think this is a much more difficult element to peel away from the story even though the pieces were there which is in my opinion a real credit towards those who originally wrote and then adapted this intricate story to the screen for me the most harrowing sequences involved the latter ones where various characters ventured armed only with a candle down into the dark drafty spooky cobwebbed basement filled with niches and hidey holes all in all this is a wonderfully crafted film and while i haven t seen the various remakes i have a pretty good feeling the original is probably still the best the picture presented in fullscreen original aspect ratio looks beautifully sharp and clean and the dolby digital mono audio comes through extremely clear the only extra featured on the dvd is a theatrical trailer for the johnny depp film secret window and odd inclusion i thought but whatever cookieman 
doctor who and the first download doctor who materialised without his tardis on this my first timelord download in the amazon unbox which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside for a very reasonable sum my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration where he encounters the nestene conciousness the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental a great experience and will not be the last easy to navigate and fun for all the family someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type tardis 
winona ryder s best film to date a film about teens plagued with mean spiritedness and revenge on their minds ends up being one of the best films of the s one of the most darkest comedies with envious contempt evil at its core yet deliciously irrisistable the whole cast is sensational especially ryder who still says in interviews today this is personally her favorite film she has done in her career 
it all depends on how you watch it i was really looking forward to this movie the hotel is intrigueing the cast looked amazing and i m a fan of ethan hawke however at first i was turned off by the movie all of the characters are tortured poets and society drop outs just know that because that kind of irresponsibility will turn a lot of people off instantly thats okay though now you know also some storylines just don t develop and you don t get any answers or much insight into any of them beyond what you see other than that the script well it is different and that is a good thing i ll explain next but its hard to write poetic lines that no one would ever really say no one would ever say most movie script dialogue anyway but even with an amazing cast like this some of the lines make you want to roll your eyes also the digital cameras make for a cool independant movie i believe made for dollars very cool and the grainy ness fits but i m just not a huge fan of the look of digital camera s once upon a time in mexico features digital cameras and i liked that much better and the constant slow motion just doesn t work still shots would have had the same effect and would have reminded you of paintings rather than pulling you out of the movie so why four stars as i began the movie i was thinking about what i just complained about in the last paragraph i checked online a bit to see what people thought and realized that it is just what it is its an art film a lot of it is just not going to make sense so i made a cup of coffee and just enjoyed it i really think some art movies paintings poems etc work better when you just let it be enjoy the mood the snapshots of lives kris kristoffersons scenes i thought were the best as did most reviewers proffesional and not the excellent acting i imagine this was a lot of fun to film as well as the actors seem to just have have fun bringing odd characters and tiny moments to life did it make sense no in fact i m actually confused about the end but i d like to see more movies like it i was able to just watch and enjoy it and not worry about where it was going in fact i kind of dozed through part of it and you know what it was nice its a movie about artists and i m guessing for artists and its just there watch it for what it is and you ll like it try to watch it as a standard movie and you ll hate it 
excellent film hilarious movie dustin hoffman and jason schwartzman were incredibly funny if you re a fan of existentialism it s a great movie but if you re not it is still worth seeing 
a great movie a visual feast i own kama sutra it s one of my favorites in my movie collection i too thoroughly enjoyed this movie and agree with many of the ratings other consumers posted however if i was looking to purchase the movie i don t think i it would be neccessary after all the specific detail given up in the review section the idea of a review is to rate the movie and state your opinion not give an in depth written scene for scene tell all what s the point of buying it when so many customers have simply given away the entire film in an attempt to review it please people practice some restraint i share your enthusiasm but really what s posted here is tmi too much information don t ruin it for those who haven t experienced the adventure of mira nair s kama sutra a tale of love

the critics didn t get it so who listens to critics the frisco kid directed by robert aldrich is the quirky inventive saga of a young polish rabbi who is sent to america in to take over a congregation in san francisco getting there proves to be quite a test of his stamina his adaptability and his religious faith gene wilder s performance as avram is a jaunty sweet and convincing triumph of comic bravado after docking in philadelphia the rabbi plays good samaritan to three nare dowells who later rob him and strand him in a strange land fortunately he comes upon some amish farmers who give him shelter and money to resume his trek after a brief stint working on the railroad avram meets tommy lillard harrison ford a bank robber with a heart of gold and a quick temper the two team up and go ricocheting from one adventure to another an escape from a posse a trial by fire at the hands of some native american indians a visit to the brotherhood of silent monks and two violent encounters with the bad boys who robbed avram in philadelphia gene wilder and harrison ford are one feisty team as rabbi and rescuer in this rough nready romp that rivals wilder s earlier blazing saddles in wild west hilarity director robert aldrich is a seasoned hand at blending roughhouse and laughter as fans of his earlier the dirty dozen and the longest yard will attest with a full posse of screen talents the frisco kid rides tall in the comedy saddle movie critics of the era panned the movie saying the pairing of gene wilder and a young harrison ford may sound intriguing but this film is not it s a startlingly unfunny comedy in which most of the jokes misfire and the evolution of the characters is forced and unbelievable wilder is a great comedic talent but salvaging this material is beyond him evidently they weren t looking for a good time talk of plot character evolution should be worried about in film making classrooms i think they should have actaully sat back and just enjoyed the romp the frisco kid is an offbeat comedy that manages to convey the sturdy faith of a believer avram will not travel on the sabbath for any reason he returns his share of the money from lillard s bank robbery he transmits the joy of judaism to the indians and he agonizes over murdering a man in self defense whereas this movie will probably not become a smash with the public it is highly regarded for the religiously sensitive

grand fenwick takes center stage in the world again in a hilarious cold war inspired film entitled the mouse that roared was produced about a fictional tiny country named the duchy of grand fenwick which is no ordinary country first it s the smallest country in the world about square miles second it s the only english speaking country in continental europe located in the french alps third its primary source of revenue is its wine when a california winery made a cheap knock off of grand fenwick s wine and reduced the nation s only source of revenue grand fenwick declared war on the u s and won ! the result the california winery stopped producing the cheap knock off and grand fenwick kept a brilliant scientist professor alfred kokintz david kossoff that they captured in the u swith the success of the mouse that roared a sequel was produced years later in and entitled the mouse on the moon unlike the first film that had peter sellers playing three of the main characters as in the original film each of these characters were played by separate actors grand duchess gloriana xii margaret rutherford prime minister rupert mountjoy ron moody and his nephew vincent mountjoy bernard cribbins only david kossoff reprised his role as professor kokintz focusing again the cold war between the u s and the former soviet union the story for the mouse on the moon begins with prime minister mountjoy coming up with what he believes will be a brilliant way to get a loan from the u s trick the u s into thinking that grand fenwick wants to start a space program when in reality he just wants the money to have indoor plumbing installed in grand fenwick s castle the u s not trusting mountjoy goes ahead and gives a grant to grand fenwick thinking that it will improve how other nations view the u s in its race with the former soviet union to send astronauts to the moon to counter the u s the soviet union sends an old space rocket to grand fenwick delighted with the gifts mountjoy proceeds with turning the rocket and money into indoor plumbing but not before professor kokintz discovers why bottles of grand fenwick wine have been inexplicably exploding they contain a new radioactive element which kokintz discovers can generate lift with vincent s eager help to become an astronaut professor kokintz proceeds to prepare the rocket for space travel which he believes will take about weeks to reach the moon to counter suspicions in the u s and the soviet union that grand fenwick is indeed using their gifts for space exploration mountjoy invites representatives from each to visit the launching of the rocket mountjoy asks professor kokintz to make it appear that the rocket explodes but unknown to him kokintz and vincent are ready to take their radioactive winepowered rocket for a roundtrip to the moon would the smallest country in the world beat the u s and the former soviet union to the moon just watch this charming film and find out though considered not as good as the original film the mouse on the moon is still very entertaining granted there are some slight mistakes with how air inside the grand fenwick rocket is maintained since it has no airlock but for few people would have realized this other interesting characters include maurice spender terrythomas cynthia june ritchie and one of the american astronauts who was played by ed bishop some sci fi tv series buffs may remember ed bishop as commander ed straker in the sci fi tv series ufo overall the mouse on the moon is a fun film and deservers a rating of out of stars 
spike lee is the only person who could have made this movie he s so earnest and unthreatening and funny there will never be another movie like this it is heart warming and scary and deals with racism in a way that a movie studio wouldn t have the guts to this is one of the most important films in cinematic history so many people i know say they hate it and hate spike lee but then i find out that they never saw it or any spike lee movie i don t know why people dislike him so much if you ve never seen a spike lee movie start here 
enough ws j lo was real and intense in this movie i ve been there done part of that and felt it was great to see the ending really great 
five tin stars for a great movie ignore all the hokum about this movie being an allegory against mccarthyism it s much broader than that it s about integrity standing against evil responsibility and being a real hero that this story is a western is almost incidental i consider it to be a classic moral story more than a classic western although it functions perfectly well as a western marshal will kane certainly does not want to die or fight alone he considers running away more from a desire to avoid unnecessary trouble than from cowardice though he is afraid but he realizes that running is not a solution in this case kane doesn t overcome fear he faces it each man in town has his own reasons for not helping kane displaying various aspects of passivity apathy fear greed and rationalization the acting setting and dialogue are sparse but brilliant the music helps to set the right emotional tone and the theme song is especially evocative and boy do i love a film shot in black and white ! 
one of the best having seen a great deal from the bbc made available on video this is one of the best ! the stories of three british families and their respective staffs are magically interwoven in fact there are remarkably smooth transitions as these tales unfold piece bypiece in each of the houses you ll find good insight into british attitudes about their own class system and social behavior of the early th century it s refreshing to see an american wife in one house her quotyankeequot frankness and outspokenness adds a nice twist to the otherwise very british cast of characters this is a wonderful dramatic series which leaves you wishing for more stories like it the costumes the props the settings and scenery the pace of and variety of plot within each the stories themselves and the acting all add up to make this truly one of the best i ve seen i agree this one is not to be missed 
so beautiful so german this film is touching and poetic beautiful and desolate it is truley of the post war zietgiest interspersed footage of the clean up of berlin and multiple references to the toll taken on the german people by the third reich the story of damiel s love for the trapeze artist is almost secondary to his love of the human condition this condition is masterfully shown as both euphoric and tragic through disjointed and philosophical dialouge the haunting imagery and bruno ganz childlike joy at his first cup of coffee i cannot recommend this film enough stars seems to sell it short it is an absolute must for anyone who loves the german style of cinema 
real movie hits home the story of a young white lawyer who goes to play ball in chicago s inner city cabrini green with a lively cast of characters who play true to life people and a bumpin soundtrack it s a great movie michael warren and d b sweeney play two men who form a unique friendship to overcome the hardships of inner city life breaking many of the steriotypical molds applied to people of the home of some of the greatest basketball stars the world can ever know as a white kid playing ball on the crest of the city this movie is my untold story 
cool flick this rocks well acted good sound track and the one thing i also love is it has that s feel even though it came out in the early s my favorite thing is at the time there was nothing like it ! 
top ten comedies housesitter has been a favorite of mine for years ! it s hilarious how goldie hawn keeps digging a hole for herself deeper and deeper and she still comes out on top in every situation steve martin is incredible ! if you liked him in roxanne get that popcorn ready you are in for another treat 
you could hear a pin drop the divergence of opinion among the reviewers regarding this film interests me and reflects the changes the media itself has undergone inspiring me to add my bit to the dialog here for what its worth first i confess to not having seen the dvd i saw under capricorn about years ago at the nuart a revival theatre in los angeles where it played as the late night feature on a double bill with strangers on a train to a packed house the showing was memorable by the middle of the film the tension had absorbed the audience to the point where you could literally have heard a pin drop in there as the cliche goes the feeling was truly amazing the energy was that of watching one of the great cinematic masterpieces and under capricorn great as it is is hardly one of the greatest film masterpieces yet many of the reviewers here would be surprised to know that a surprising number of the most respected critics consider this rather musty treasure from the golden age of technicolor one of hitchcock s greatest achievements part of the problem is that the action in this costume drama hails from an age when the ne plus ultra in special effects was stuff like charlton heston parting the red sea in the ten commandments and that was several years after the release of this film there really is no viable action to speak of in the film which if films had academic subtitles could be called under capricorn hitch meets henry james really it is the jamesian novel of film before movies of james novels came into vogue although the heiress one of the most lauded and popular films of was hollywood s first major adaptation of a james novel one can see flashes of under capricorn in the more droll moments of the french new wave cinema of the s many of whose makers were nursed on hitchcock but calling this rather serious film merely slow paced would be euphemistic the film bombed at the box office back in and would probably not fare much better if as well today then what exactly has earned this glorified and rather messy soap plaudits from the some of the most selective critics an enduring cult following and standing ovations at revival showings not the storyline trite even for the melodramatic s not the visuals there s not a whole lot to commend under capricorn in any technical category what is great making the film appear larger than perhaps it is is a surfeit of that elusive combination of awesome acting and on screen chemistry could it be that hitch really was as great a director of actors as some have claimed these actors don t need script or props and in truth they don t get much of either and yet they cast a big time spell the other reviewers have concentrated on the performances of the central characters the beautiful strained couple played by joseph cotten and the gorgeous ingrid bergman in one of her most fetching screen appearances if her character played the hilt is seemingly somewhat vapid at heart these seasoned pros are brilliant and the subtlety of their portrayals in which their characters show a truly lifelike complete unconsciousness of what is going on around them and their bittersweet devotion to each other catalyzes the dramatic tension but center stage in this film belongs without doubt to the moral battle as it evolves between protagonist and antagonist of the drama played respectively by the magnificent michael wilding in what must simply be called a larger than life performance as aunt clary s boy who comes to australia to make his fortune and the great british heavy margaret leighton and the action here which does unfold is moral under capricorn is in essence an old fashioned morality play as wilding s character urbane polished in the deeper sense puts on the shining armor of altruism and engages in a furious yet utterly muted combat with leighton s the latter flawlessly projects in probably less twenty minutes of screen time one of the great evils of the age a character fueled entirely by envy a desperate nasty have not of little or no formal education utterly lost in the fury of her blindly narrow furtive conditioned scheming the escalation of the this conflict gives the film its noted ballast as the moral extremes in us are played out against the usual banal superficial and prosaic social contexts the ponderously crafted sets the costumes are finally retired and our real faces are revealed for what they are as wilding s character says to bergman s in his incredible farewell scene i suppose i ll be the first man who ever went to australia not to return with a fortune and she never will know how much he loved her and how much he d sacrificed sublime 
when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
the story of king david i didn t hear much about this movie but just recently i saw this movie on cinamax to see pretty much see propably dmx s last performance altho i didn t like his characters in hollywod action blockbusters exit wounds and cradle the grave because they were bad one selling drugs the other a thief but tried to make them good it was just plain out stupid but in this film you get to see the reason why dmx would be considered to be called dark manx because in this movie he plays one baaaaad dude and his performance was unbalievable dmx gets a serious role and just exceeded my exectations also nice performances by michael ealy as a man filled with nothing but revenge and sorrow david arquet the man who uncoverd david s past via his documentery and cliftion powel the man king david owes this movie is dark gritty and a movie that shouldn t be slept on especially by fans of x anyone who is tired of all these fake hood movies like state property or hot boyz should definitly take a look at this gritty film peac

cool walk i won t go into the details other reviewers shared but the sound of lee marvin s shoes touching the asphalt in the beginning of the movie is quite haunting fascinating and original marvin is shown walking through the airport and even though the next scene portrays him as standing by a window and meditating in a hotel room the sounds of his walk continues it gives touch to the dreamy atmosphere of the whole movie 
all about eve this classic is one of the best movies ever bette davis as the aging not so gracefully star with the wicked tongue thelma ritter doing what she does best and george sanders in the perfect role for him as the critic ann baxter playing the ingenue eve what else can i say everyone who enjoys movies will love this one 
one of the most powerful documentaries ever made to start off the criticism that this film is too one sided or has an agenda demonstrates a lack of understanding of what a documentary is and does documentary filmmakers all have agendas they have a point ofview and must engage viewers emotionally or they fail in their task i saw hearts and minds in college in about the campus auditorium was packed with mostly sympathetic liberal college students with the exception of about half a dozen uniformed military clearly present to ridicule the film and voice their opposition as has been mentioned in other reviews a stunned silence gripped the room at the end of the film as the parade clown shouting come on ! smile ! get happy pranced into the fade out at the end of the credits the only sound was the audible sobbing coming from the military protesters we as an audience stayed to talk to them and to help them deal with the emotions they were experiencing it was one of the most amazing experiences i ve ever had at a movie it forever burned the power of film into my mind of course the filmmakers have an anti war agenda of course the film is harshly critical of a government that in its view sent a generation off to an un winnable war and basically forgot about them and the horrific experience they endured the film is compassionate and caring about the soldiers in the vietnam war while being unmerciful in its presentation of the politicians and upper echelon bureaucrats who perpetuated the war are you really asking me this goddamn silly question mr davis asks presidential advisor walt rostow almost rolling his eyes when asked to explain the origins of the vietnam conflict this embarrassing pompous moment might have been edited out of a less courageous film but director peter davis is taking no prisoners the portraits here of heroes victims villains and cads are incisive and powerful an earlier reviewer criticized the film for using the interviews with the parents of a deceased soldier the parents are proud of their son proud of president nixon even though an on screen disclaimer notes that these comments were made pre watergate and seemingly proud of the way he died they have clearly chosen to be a part of the film voluntarily so when the mother breaks down at a fond memory of her son the audience does not feel pity but rather great compassion for these good people who have been lied to and whose son died for the lie of course a film could be made to show the noble intentions of our involvement in the war or you could just rent the john wayne movie the green berets but it is fairly universally granted that the vietnam war was a tragic shameful episode in american history this film made and released at the moment of america s withdrawal from vietnam at a time when support for the war was at its lowest captures that feeling of depression and anger it is a film of its time and should not be criticized for that neither should it be missed 
excellent a must see i am an year old white male from a high class family i loved this movie the performance of omar and ll cool j is just amazing i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspense movies and doesnt mind a movie about black suburbi 
like oh my god ! this movie is totally bitchin the popular s teen film valley girl based on frank zappa s novelty song of the same title popularized the image of the valley girl a valley girl usually referred to girls from the san fernando valley in california this type of girl usually dressed in preppy colorful clothes had their own slang terms cared about their social status and usually had money in valley girl the movie was released and became a cult status film depicting the valley girl lifestyle the movie stars deborah foreman as julie richman a popular preppy girl from the san fernando valley and nicolas cage as randy a young punk from hollywood after dumping her preppy good looking boyfriend julie attends one of her friends parties and ends up meeting randy even though they are from different worlds these two show that opposites do attract and instantly become an item even though her parents are cool with their relationship her friends aren t and pressure julie into dumping him so she can get back with her ex this film is not only great but has an incredible soundtrack with so many great new wave hits watch for musical appearances by the plimsouls and josie cotton in this film as well for those of you who were around when this film came out will probably view it with nostalgia as for those of us who weren t will love looking at the awesome fads trends and listening to the great music overall this film is like totally trepindicular fer sure !

great stuff wow this movie was fun i never saw it before and because i ve been on a big hammer and amicus kick lately took a chance on it i was not disappointed like other amicus productions what we get here are several horror stories in one all centered on incurably insane patients in a british asylum there are some great stars here that make it work oh so well including patrick magee a clockwork orange robert powell tommy jesus of nazareth herbert lom phantom of the opera peter cushing do i need name all of his great horror films richard todd stage fright barry morse gerard from the s tv series classic the fugitive geoffrey bayldon the house that dripped blood the scrumptious britt ekland the wicker man beautiful charlotte rampling the fury and lovely bonnie parkins the mephisto waltz the transfer from dark sky films is fantastic it looks like a brand new film it s presented in anamorphic widescreen and looks great when played in a progressive scan dvd player on a hd television looking forward to the upcoming release of from beyond the grave from image never saw that one before either but am looking forward to buying it just the same im hopeful other amicus classics including dr terror s house of horrors tales from the crypt and vault of horror will be released on dvd soon there are rumors abound that vault and tales will soon be released by th century fox in england but that won t help those of us living in the states much dr terror was released in england on dvd but never in the u s there is a demand for these films here let s get with it whoever owns the rights 
excellent ! simply excellent this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really don t know what to think except that today is a day of honor i won t blow it for you watch this one first if you re not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures

husbands wives woody allen s film husbands and wives was released around the time we first heard the words soon yi which is ironic considering the subject matter of the film husbands and wives is billed as a comedy but is more of a drama there are a few jokes but there s nothing incredibly funny in the film the movie is told like a documentary featuring interviews with the characters and handheld cinematography allen and mia farrow play gabe and judy roth a couple who have been married for ten years and think everything is well then their two friends jack and sally sydney pollack judy davis announce they are getting divorced which causes gabe and judy to question the validity of their own marriage as jack and sally move on with jack getting a much hotter younger woman and sally lusting after michael played by liam neeson gabe and judy begin to move farther apart gabe a college professor finds himself falling for a yearold student named rain juliette lewis and judy finds herself also lusting after michael the movie is minutes but a lot of stuff happens in the film this is not one of woody allen s best it s not in the top anyway it s overwrought and is not his most entertaining the performances are very good especially farrow pollack and davis juliette lewis meanwhile has echoes of mariel hemingway in manhattan in her performance the cinematography and mock documentary style of the film gets old after a while with the former getting headache inducing after a while husbands and wives is a good study of marriage and infidelity one critic i don t recall which one it was said that husbands and wives seemed like allen trying to come to grips with the soon yi debacle but the ending here is quite different husbands and wives has its merits it s demerits but it s a worthy woody allen film that s definitely worth watching grade b 
state and main the old water mill or without title this gem of a movie was probably not a blockbuster when released the storyline is thin and almost non existent it could be summed up as everyone gets the chance to screw up a second time nevertheless there are enough twists and turns to make what story there is interesting this must be the sort of movie that every good actor and actress would love to have a role in as the screenplay has been written by an accomplished playwright it is a farcical melodrama rather than a comedy but nonetheless highly enjoyable a film making team hard up on critical funds has just been thrown out of a small town in new hampshire their movie s plot necessitates the choice of a small town new england locale and a water mill one reason why they are short of funds is that they had to build an old water mill replica in the new hampshire town as the movie begins the director and his crew find themselves in a small town in vermont actually most of the scenes are shot in connecticut or massachusetts the beauty of the location is well captured by excellent photography the makers of state and main did not fall into the trap of shooting the film during the fall new england fall colours would be a major distraction although alfred hitchcock s black comedy the trouble with harry succeeded despite being shot in vermont at the peak of the fall leaf colour season but then hitchcock was an exceptional genius the small town has being going on in its leisurely way until the film crew arrive the obvious star of state and main is philip seymour hoffman a previously little known hollywood actor whose first appeared on the screen as the spoilt rich daddy supported george willis jr in that memorable al pacino film scent of a woman hoffman s key role in state and main is as the author and screen play writer for the movie within the movie the better known hollywood star alec baldwin plays the lesser role of the film in making s male star he is portrayed as a lustful male whose sexual preference is of under age nubile girls the director is played by william h macy who is completely unflappable no matter what the producer arrives after the crew has settled in the role is played by droopy eyed david paymer who is completely obsessed with money and will bribe anyone to get things moving the male star lead is almost fatally distracted by a young teenager julia stiles the female lead and siren sarah jessica parker demands substantial extra money for appearing naked in a scene claiming that she has found religion hoffman is smitten in the heart by an attractive young woman rebecca pidgeon in the town who is engaged or semi engaged to the local bad man and town councillor i will leave it to the reader s imagination to find out if the film crew gets the second chance to screw up again the movie is directed by david mamet a leading american playwright mamet wrote the screen plays for the postman always rings twice the untouchables and had a minor role as a performer in the thriller black widow he has directed several movies aside from this one in the past years it is evident that mamet who also wrote the screen play for this charming melodrama was at a loss for a suitable title for the film just like the director in the play who wanted to call his movie the old mill only to find out upon arrival in the vermont town that the much advertised old mill had burnt down in so mamet settled on the uninspiring title state and main from the intersection where the town s brand new traffic lights still stand at the start of the movie interestingly enough the title for the dvd version of state and main circulating in greece is translated as without title i am fairly confident that this little known minute movie will become a movie buff s classic one day 
what s so special about mary s house this movie is based on the story the adventure of the three gables written by sir arthur conan doyle to sherlock jeremy brett receives a letter from a mary maberly mary ellis ive had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with my house known as the three gables and i would much value your advice you would find me at home anytime tomorrow i believe my late husband mortimer maberly was one of your early clients it turns out that a person wants to buy her house at a high price on the condition that she does not take anything out of it not even her personal possessions this extreme interest in her house began after the recent death of her grandson douglas maberly gary cady this episode is special for the following reasons dr watson edward hardwicke gets beaten to a pulp trying to protect mary sherlock comes in contact with an intelligent beautiful woman named isadora klein claudineauger who seems to have power over men brett as usual does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance finally the costumes background music attention to detail and cinematography are quite well done in conclusion this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it s based on min british drama made for tv full screen 
we need more tilghman movies amazingly of the reviewers myself included are related to tilghman which says more about hollywood than the descendants of this great man there is so much material from his life to base movies on and it simply hasn t been done for some reason i found this movie to be wonderful if only to let the world know that tilghman even existed and his death was an important event so i m glad it was portrayed the acting was well done and in general the casting was great the wiley lynn character at first seems over the top but if you are familiar with the man you realize that this was a very accurate portrayal lynne was eventually brought down in a hail of lead but not after taking down another beloved man i had some problems with the accuracy of the film though if you ve ever been to chandler oklahoma you won t see huge mountains in the distance and tilghman never rode his horse from chandler to cromwell he loved his car i love sam elliot and he does a great job but he s just not a year old man i wish the older children from his frist marriage were shown and the funeral and multiple memorial services he was given could have been mentioned other than i highly recommend this film 
one more time the greatest of all movies it is impossible to overpraise this film on any dimension of quality visually it is so rich that i have found in my many watchings of it that it is worth taking your eyes off the centre of the screen and just absorbing what is going on at its peripheries depth of image chiarascuro mise enscen mood and texture all are so nuanced the cast is almost the definitive classical academy of french film and drama of the last century only jean marais is missing catch him along with the underrated maria casares who plays the only muted and smewhat boring part in les enfants in cocteau s orphee same period roughyl same visual brilliance and the same five star rating pierre barasseur whose th century grand passion performance from othello is in itself superb the haunting jean louis barrault who with his wife madeleine renaud was the leader in classical french theater post world war ii and of course arletty the enigma around whom the entire film centers i cannot think of any film with such a peerless cast them there is jaques prevert s script and carne s direction is peerless reflecting perhaps his own very enigmatic personality his other films share the visual and dramatic power of les enfants but seem more dated here somehow he found the exact style to create a film deeply rooted in history but not locked into it no one has ever directed such a cast of varied and great actors and given them so much space of expression and style while maintaining a unity the film is balzacian in its breadth of story reminiscent of pere goriot perhaps and covers so many moods and themes and scenes it can be very funny brasseur as the vain worldly frederick lemaitre and so deeply sad barrault as baptiste both of which are portrayals based on real actors of the th century and both of which are genuinely great in their capturing of the grand acting style of the period without this being pastiche or artificial it is impossible to overrate this film if you haven t seen it don t be put off by the idea that it s a period piece black andwhite french and sure to be boring it s over sixty years old now and still profoundly beautiful deeply moving and most of all unforgettable 
hilarious comedy this is a stunning comedy starring jim carrey who plays a lawyer who is incapable of telling the truth or keeping his promises is this really a surprise things make a dramatic turn when he fails to keep a promise to turn up at his son s birthday party the neglected son brilliantly played by justin cooper as max reede makes a wish for his father not to lie for just one day the boy s wish is granted and his dad loses his ability to lie a tragic affliction for any lawyer he cannot lie in court as well as to all those around him like his secretary and mother this now honest man displays his comic talents that is bound to set you laughing your lungs out carrey is ably supported by his ex wife audrey maura tierney who is now dating cary elwes a simpleton of a man this is one of jim carrey s best films his facial contortions voice and crazy humour stands him out as an outstanding comedian this is as good as it gets the director tom shadyac should be applauded for this high quality production this movie should not be missed by anyone with a sense of humour and all those fathers who neglect their children for the sake of making money 
journey to hell with your inner demons in a rare case of art imitating life woody allen gives us his comedy deconstructing harry where we meet harry block a neurotic writer unfaithful to all of his wives addict to sedatives obsessed with sex and prostitutes a man who shamelessly offends family members and friends with his books in a jiff a classic woody allen character but darker sadder more isolated and more immature now on the verge of a famous university tribute harry must deal with his insecurities bad habits and nerves while he begins a journey where he will interact with dual realities the ones in his agitated life and the ones reflected through the characters of his books and will show the audience with very black humor his incapacity to have honest relationships and his absurd excuses to defend his nasty actions he will revolve in the deepest caves of his destructive side until literally go to hell as never had done an allen s characterto recommend deconstructing harry implies to warn you that you ll be part of a sordid world of phobias obsessions fear of death hypochondrias and neurosis all of this wrapped up with a coat of vulgarity and repulsiveness that won t run out through the minutes of the film its a respectable intelligent witty and crude work here allen has consumed himself as an irreverent honest and brutal he gives us a stellar cast with colorful characters with harry as the center of everything the dialogs are quick witty full of cynicism and will get as many laughs as many stomach kicks but let s appreciate his honesty not criticize it its inevitable not to compare allen s life and personality with his harry his ability to create memorable and valuable works in spite of the scandals surrounding his life his personality a little neurotic and lonely why can t i function in life i only function in art his willingness to use himself as a joke his toughness with himself is a hit in deconstructing harry even when it brings him near to self destructionallens creative genius and his talent as a filmmaker once again are here on the top just like harry allen s life has been full of chaos and scandals but he has proved if anyone had a doubt to be an exceptional artist and that s the only thing that should matter to the audience

the torch song singer i found the movie to be wonderful funny and true to life the service from amazon com to be prompt efficient dependable the delivery was on time and product in excellent condition 
almodovar the god no transvestites no transvestites that s just sublime especially for an almodovar film still there will always be this innovative edge that eeks strange psychic male nurses crying lovers and two comatized patients make one brilliant film by one eccentric director it s doesn t have that soap opera esque appeal that pedro is known for but it does contain a certain distinguished factor that is absolutely mesmerizing the cinematography the depth of the film is surreal the bull fighting is grotesque and the adventurous ideals of the director are normal but still bold talk to her hable con ella is a film about love faith deception and innocence each moment you discover these moments is another tear that comes dripping from your eye 
my kids like it i can watch it too i never remember seeing this as a child i watched lots of television too i do enjoy chuck jones and you can certainly see a few of his touches throughout this movie even if you don t really try to find them the movie is okay but not the best thing i have ever seen in my life a little sappy and only minutes long i really like the bugs bunny stuff better but i gave it stars because my kids really do like it and sometimes you don t have time for a minute movie especially near bedtime if they ask to watch one more this or rikki tikki tavi is a fine choice 
hot hot hot jeremy irons has an affair with his son s fiancee juliette binoche and becomes obsessed with her great erotic scenes though not a lot of skin is shown follow his obsession which leads to their affair being discovered then tragedy the ending sees irons character as withdrawn and alienated from everyone wondering was it worth it 
it s funny campy interesting on several levels people are missing the comedy intended and not in their reviews the script reportedly went through writers and they shot two endings my friend and i think that bruce vilanch who has a cameo as a bartender in a west hollywood leather bar may have written one of the drafts jane s virtuoso comic scene in the airport what about vegas you fly to vegas is priceless as she goes through a whole dramatic act about her dying sister the drag queen she goes to visit has several funny lines diane salinger has some classic overdone reaction shots at the climax which are funny ! love it and don t agree with the other reviewer who said it s not involving you re grabbed from the beginning by the situation the acting the glamorous l a locations the cinematography i m first in line for the dvd i wish they d included the alternate ending but supposedly there s a featurette and audio commentary by jane and lumet 
grim ww based anti war flick errol flynn basil rathbone and david niven star in the sobering film the dawn patrol which undoubtedly served as the model for the ww classic twelve o clock high they are all members of the th fighter squadron of the royal flying corps based in france in a somber basil rathbone playing major brand is the squadron leader day after day he depressingly orders his pilots on dangerous missions which create a high mortality rate ace pilot capt courtney played by flynn and his able wingman lt scott played by niven continously marshal replacement pilots with little combat experience into the skies to face almost certain death flynn despises rathbone for the missions of death he orders them on the tables are turned when rathbone gets promoted due to a daring and succeesful mission flown by flynn and niven flynn becomes squadron commander and must order his pilots on those deadly missions lead now by niven he now realizes the plight that was driving rathbone mad niven and flynn have a falling out when nivens baby brother turns up as one of the green replacement pilots he is immediately shot down on his first mission flynn is ordered to ask for a volunteer to fly a suicidal mission behind enemy lines when niven opts to fly the mission flynn gets him intoxicated and heroically flies in his stead while the aviation dogfights in this well acted flick are nothing spectacular the plot and performances rendered by the solid cast get the director s message across loud and clear 
hepburn o toole and givenchy what more do you need william wyler s how to steal a million is the very best stanley donen picture that stanley donen didn t happen to make just as donen s charade also with audrey hepburn is the very best hitchcock picture that hitchcock never made this is a truly stylish film how to steal a million looks like ten million a hundred million aw in this inflationary era let s call it a billion bucks on the screen hepburn s roughly two hundred costume changes her preposterous little car her hats her chateau and everything else shout that this is what the expensively good life looks like in one scene o toole invites hepburn for once looking a bit dowdy to come as she is give givenchy the night off he says a quick glance over the previous amazon reviews shows that those who know and care about this film use the language of people discussing a classic and yet whatever its considerable merits how to steal a million was not a particular success at the box office when it first appeared nor is it widely remembered today i can only speculate why this should be perhaps it was the proximity of charade good as this film is charade was better a tighter script a better balance between thrills and comedy and the overwhelming presence of cary grant o toole has always been excellent in comedy but his part in this film is unquestionably a cary grant part and nobody did those as well as the old master archie leech himself on the other hand it may be that how to steal a million is a willy wyler film and it doesn t feel right or entirely at home among that director s works somehow i doubt that wyler s many admirers are likely to list this one high among his masterworks or maybe it came out when the public was satiated with well acted lavishly produced well made films and it just fell between the cracks whatever the reasons for its present semi obscurity how to steal a million is a gem and highly recommendable to anyone who believes that quality in movies extends beyond cgi effects and stuff blowin up real good five stars a note on changing times when i saw this movie during its first run along with everyone else in the theater i thought a million dollars was a lot of money just listen to the s prices quoted for major works of art they are laughable and a little sad too today a further note on marketing this is a movie about high end art forgery it is filled with exquisite paintings and sculptures in almost every scene all of which were forged for the movie part of the publicity campaign for how to steal a million was a public exhibition of the forged artworks

can a still mute image catch that forever stephen poliakoff s made forbritish television film shooting the past focuses on the fate of a remarkable photograph collection housed in a sprawling country mansion the photographs known as the fallon photograph collection are stored in various rooms to the collection s caretakers led by the elegant marilyn truman lindsay duncan the care of the photographs is more than just a job its a labour of love when the film begins the staff members of the fallon museum are preparing to greet the photograph collection s new owner enter brash american millionaire christopher cunningham liam anderson and his whiz kid assistant cunningham dismisses the museum staff s attempts at a welcome and abruptly announces that he plans to convert the museum into a business school the photographs are to be sold and all the museum employees will lose their jobs the staff members profess shock and outrage but cunningham insists that he exchanged faxes with the museum explaining his plans while margaret truman begs to save the collection and attempts to prove its worth to cunningham her assistant the peculiar eccentric and crafty oswald bates timothy spall wants to fight back using guerilla tactics and just how the drama plays out in this splendidly acted and entertaining three hour long film will please most fans of british television writerdirector poliakoff s message the power and the importance of the past isnt particularly subtle but it is satisfying in shooting the past the issue isn t just that an irreplaceable collection is about to be thoughtlessly tossed aside the larger issue is the new vs the old the fact that the destroyer of civilisation is an american and the saviours or caretakers in this case are british is a bit of a cliche but there s more than this below the surface the caretakers of the fallon collection reside in an outmoded world stuffed to the brim with an unwieldy number of photographs and they ll do whatever it takes to preserve the collection and keep it intact even at the cost of promised new employment would cunningham s efficient assistant who has his cell phone glued to his ear while he types away frantically on a laptop exhibit such loyalty and self sacrifice for his employer s business school i doubt it but it s the glory of photography that holds centre stage here the photographs that capture a priceless moment and hold keys to the secrets of the past while the film s ending seems a little far fetched it s still solidly entertaining if you enjoy shooting the past then there s an excellent chance you ll enjoy another poliakoff made fortelevision film almost strangers displacedhuma 
edge of your seat i saw this in the theater when it first came out had to have a copy because it is so gripping look at world events in the middle east today and you will appreciate this film even more 
a powerful and gritty film dancing at the blue iguana is a film whose story was developed during a five month improvisational workshop run by director michael radford the story centers around the blue iguana your average seedy strip club this one located in a faceless semi industrial area of the san fernando valley part of la each of the lead actors developed their own character and storyline based on their own research there have been a couple of pathetic attempts by hollywood to make a film about the world of strip clubs namely showgirls and demi moore s abhorrent striptease but both of those failed miserably dancing at the blue iguana succeeds brilliantly walk into any average to below average strip club in america and you ll find stories that are not at all dissimilar from the stories developed by the blue iguana s five dancers all played brilliantly by darryl hannah sandra oh charlotte ayanna shiela kelly and jennifer tilly the one story element that sticks out as overly fantastic is that of the russian hit man played by vladimir mashkov who because his target is being held for questioning by the fbi is stuck in a hotel next to the club and falls for darryl hannah s character because he sees her smoking outside the club all the time but if you replace the russian hit man with a businessman stuck in town for a week it still makes sense and would be much more believable robert wisdom who plays eddie the owner of the club and w earl brown who plays his right hand man bobby both do a wonderful job in this movie as well the camera work is first rate and does a fantastic job capturing the unscripted dialogue the soundtrack is perfect for this film in a film about strip clubs there is obviously going to be a lot of nudity and there is in this film but it s not done in a gratuitous way the film also kind of starts and ends in the middle of each of the stories but that s the way life is i found it just absolutely compelling and rivetting in some sense the way a train wreck is compelling because some of these young women have real problems i could have watched another two hours of this though it was that good strip clubs are often sad places both the dancers and their customers often have melancholy tales dancing at the blue iguana captures that milieu in a perfectly downbeat way really a great film 
rich beautiful movie with great performances this is one of those rare movies that lives right at the edge of pretension and overambition but nails it where to start the performances are great thus far this is the only strong performance i ve seen from liv tyler i hope she can recreate this jeremy iron weaves gold as always many of the other actors deliver powerful rich performances the writing ideas dialogue are also intricate entertaining and thought provoking visually as one would expect the movie is stunning and being filmed in italy doesn t hurt lastly the soundtrack is hip and fits perfectly if only there were more like this ! 
funny movie pretty funny movie it was odd to see adam west not in his batman role

tender mercies excellent movie mr duvall did his own singing in the film an love the song over you that was played in it 
roller coaster pal to psycho killer even though this film might be categorized as a guilty pleasure it still contains excellent early performances by mark wahlberg reese witherspoon and a maturing alyssa milano production value is high so this is definitely not a b movie the well developed plot is a familiar one good girl meets great guy who ends up being a psycho but the lack of originality doesn t take away from the interesting progression of the movie directing editing writing and acting are still top notch and even though wahlberg s character ends up going off the deep end he portrays a believable normal guy in the beginning even providing an intense roller coaster service early in the movie he made a pretty good psycho as well i enjoyed the film and would even watch it again

i keep telling people to see this film i keep telling folks to watch this film their eyes roll they get this isnt he pitiful look on their faces they try to humor me obviously i need help but see the thing is i never really liked tammy faye or jimmie b or the whole jesus as sales tool schlock fest i watched the film because i thought it would be a hoot rupaul narrates it after all imagine my surprise when i wound up with a new respect for tammy faye she is a survivor if nothing else sure she makes spaghetti sauce with ketchup but she was one of the first and certainly the most high profile christians to express concern for the victims of aids i loved her dismantling of the rabid jerry falwell and no matter what awful stuff happens to her and hers she retains a life force a hope that is downright inspiring see this film

add on to review below just a note i can t find as anyone s caught this the soundtrack for this film is by benjamin frankel a serious british composer whose symphonies are highly regarded and is one of the best film scores ive encountered in some time in fact i m surprised it isn t better known as it approaches the quality sir william walton reached in his shakespeare scores for olivier i d buy this dvd just for the music otherwise this is an absolutely wonderful flick and as an exercise in humorous cynicism about how the modern world operates i d double bill it with wilder s absurdly under rated one two three 
a movie jack black was made for great movie i do not think any other actor could have done a better job he was perfectly cast for this movie 
my boys picked this out and we all loved it ok so this isn t the best movie ever made it s still one slam bang adventure movie that even though it has some places that might not be kid friendly is still a great family action movie billy zane and kristy swanson make a nice couple and treat williams is one bad guy that you can t wait to see get what he should all in all a very good but not great action movie for the whole famil 
the fall rise of darth vader i love this film it s my favorite next to star wars the empire strikes back ! i have to admit that i had a thrill watching the emergence of anakin skywalker s darker self darth vader from his knighting under darth sidious a ka supreme chancellor turnedgalactic emperor palpatine to his fiery fall out with oki wan kenobi far off no wonder he s my all around favorite character besides luke skywalker han solo in addition to princess leia ! i also enjoy reading the current novels but i wish there d be more plenty on darth vader in between the episodes ! 
you should know what you re getting into by reading the movies discription you should somewhat know what you are getting into it is hard to find this movie listed anywhere without the word dark in front of comedy dark generally means that some unpleasant material is covered by the movie within this movie genre you also have grosse pointe blank which is a goofy comedy that should hardly be construed as dark and about schmidt which has virtually no comedic value but is dark this isn t a laugh a minute comedy most dark comedies aren t it is a story that starts out somewhat serious and plausible and is meant to be funny by the shear absurdity of the remaining events this has violence gore and some disturbing moments if you watch this movie with the idea that it is a movie and is meant to be a fun take on a very serious situation the cast is great and portray great characters cameron diaz is great as the crazed bride determined to have the perfect wedding it is an over the top depiction of the bride tobe who has to have her wedding and will not have it ruined for any reason but it is funny from that standpoint watch it more than once because the second time around you ll be more numb to the shock of some of the scenes and be able to enjoy the parts that are supposed to be funny instead of dwelling on the very bad things 
nice soap opera i liked the mini series acting is good scenery lovely costuming is superb gives the viewer a real feel for the place and time unfortunately there are some things i don t care for both sides if there s a character in one family there is another in the other just like that person some of the relationships are somewhat stale the main villein is really two dimensional both the southern main character and his northern counterpart fall in love with women socially unacceptable to their society the northerner falls in love with and marries an irish catholic lass the southerner falls in love with a girl who turns out to be the daughter of a harlot and an octeroon one african great grandparent i would have prefurred something more open since history reveals there were quite a few gentle relationships between southern white men and women of african decent which would spare the audience this soap opera stuff great scenerey wonderful scenes wonderful authentic costuming just pathetic as sopa operas are 
better than snow white and the seven dwarfs cinderella is the film that saved the walt disney company i don t want to tell the story because everyone knows the story of cinderella i highly recommand this movie it reminds everyone of childhood 
those were the years to say this is a great film is probably an overstatement but it certainly is a great idea for a film gibson looks good weaver looks good hunt acts good weir directs good and the script is better than good much it s a movie about ideas which earns high marks these days as so few flics can make that claim sure it stumbles a bit and the ending is purposely frustrating to carry forward the theme of white guilt and what then shall we do beyond all that it s sensual and unpredictable and pretty damned intelligent seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill i ain t see it for yourself 
un box revisited this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i don t see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in mb bites each hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy 
excellent great tom hanks performance i really don t understand people saying that tom hanks s performance was was not good or that he overplayed the part i think his performance was just right i do agree that the bad language was not needed and did not help the movie this is the only reason that i give it four stars as opposed to five i barely even know who the coen brothers are but i found this movie better than the original which is a rare thing i think the story was very well done and the ironic conclusion was very well executed 
unexpected going into this movie i expected alot of bs especially noting that the two lead characters were rappers i must give alot of props to ja rule he actually was a pretty good actor ! also i expected alot of gun fights with no real plot however i was pleasantly proved wrong this movie actually gives us a chance as the audience to get in tune with the characters in return giving us the ability to be sympythetic towards them and what they re going through the plot is pretty simple two something black males trying to get over their cashflow problem one who s love is music the other just want any method of getting set for life throught the movie we see what obsticles they must cross in order for their dreams to become reality even though the start is slow the tone of this picture slowly developes so that you ll still want to sit through til the end 
richard pryor master storyteller you know it kind of bothers me when folks label others especially when the label minimizes a person s worth ask just about anyone to describe richard pryor and most likely you ll hear he was a funny dude a comedian while of course both are very true it s also an incomplete and unfair assessment of richard pryor because he was much more than that along with being the quintessential stand up comedian he was an incredibly talented writer actor cultural scribe and comedic visionary but one of mr pryor s most overlooked talents was that of master storyteller when richard pryor talked about events from childhood through adulthood or shared an observation it was more than just a bunch of funny anecdotes strung together he carefully skillfully recreated the moment the mood the scene and the context of that story you weren t just hearing a simple recollection of his experience he actually took you there and was almost able to witness it firsthand richard pryor tells his stories by bringing together special elements and ingredients and expertly mixing all into an amazing experience you can say it s like watching a tapestry being made all the parts big and small no matter how inconsequential that they may appear to be individually combined with a master s touch you have a fine work of art this release of richard pryor in concert is a wonderful film that illustrates those talents and more seeing this movie again made me realize how nice it was to have someone so talented as richard pryor to entertain us and make us laugh until we wet ourselves but yet sad that he s gone and there will probably never be someone as talented or as remarkable again 
ozu most japanese of the japanese directors ozu has been called the most japanese of all japanese directors and for good reason he is ohayo good morning is ozu at his japanese best there is a misunderstanding among the neighborhood ladies some club money has turned up missing the misunderstanding is compounded by two boys who after an argument with their parents are told to shut up the boys want a television set the parents do not the boys take their parents admonition to shut up to the extreme they stop speaking to everybody even the neighborhood ladies these ladies find that their customary greetings of ohayo good morning to the boys goes unanswered the ladies feel that the boys mother is angry at them and a neighborhood quarrel ensues finally the parents relent the boys get their television set so life resumes to normality once again everyone is happy no action just everyday life 
classic james cagney performance in one of the landmark gangster films of the depression era few performers have become so identified with one particular type of role as james cagney did with the gangster genre and even though in later decades he proved his ability in many diverse areas of screen acting his tough guy playing in early classics like warner bros studios hard hitting gangster story public enemy is what stays in the mind 
not my favorite madonna but worth it dont get me wrong i love madonna she beautiful provocative talented and all those things but this is my least favorite concert the concert was in support to her racy album erotica and it was around the time her infamous but star sex book was released she had a few lows during the concert ie like a virgin vogueand la isla bonita but she performed her new hits with style and originality ! deeper and deeper erotica bye bye baby fever why its so hard and rain madonna was working her bottom off it seemed during the elaborate show the girlie show was splendid again not one of her best such as drowned world or confessions tour but would would defiently recommend this its a great item to have for any fan and its an exotic show to be watched many will love ! its very racy in some seens it should be for kids and up recommended 
a film only cool people will like this is another well done thinking man s film starring tim roth who has a great american accent for a brit nerds such as leonard maltin need not apply to try to understand this film the script is superior and only unintelligible to the inferior viewer the masses if you like junk such as american beauty you probably won t like this if you are a thinking cool alternative person and want to be engrossed in a complex psychodrama and have your comprehension skills challenged this is the film for you tim roth s character is a complex product of nihilistic philosophy and narcissistic desire as he confronts cops interrogating him for murder as the film begins we learn he has a ba in psychology and a iq not that an iq score is relevant to much but the psychology plays an integral part here in response to the film being lynchian i would really say this film is better than any lynch film except maybe eraserhead just one note on one of the solipsistic ramblings of the murder victim being alone is only an illusion in a way that at and t has little to do with we re all connected 
super di aye aye here s a message to hollywood there are perhaps a million former marines out there that will buy the d i on dvd as soon as its released i saw the di as a year old on television in i was petrified by the movie and never thought i d join the marines because of it well in i did join and went through bootcamp in san diego almost within sight of my house i think full metal jacket is more realistic but doesn t deliver the positive message served up in the di webb does a magnificent job depicting the stoic drill instructor the intensity of the training in bookcamp the concern for details as depicted in the breaking down and reassembly of an m that make up a recruits world are dead on the di is a classic like other reviewers before me i find it puzzling that this film hasn t made the transition to dvd when so much garbage has but then hollywood and the people that populate show biz haven t a clue about being a marine its been almost years and i still remember the names of my drill instructors sgt alley where are you semper fi 
brudal and a bit shocking dmx stars as the drug dealer king david who pops up in the streets again after a long absence rolling into the frame in a player s classic a late s stutz blackhawk king david shrugs his way back into the hard knock life he quickly reaps what he sows and mortally wounded passes all his worldly goods to paul david arquette a scrambling white would be writer king david s estate includes an audio journal of his life which provides flashbacks and a narrative withinanarrative that answers the shaken paul s curiosity it s the highlights of king david s high life that propel alone like all of goines s heroes king david is a scourge on the periphery and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity every life he touches he leaves in ruins a need to deface beauty as a result of self loathing is implicit and dmx signals that motivation with sly hostility to say that king david is the best part he s ever had is an understatement he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before i would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods 
it is worth watching the second time this film is soothing in its beauty its irony its eternal understanding and acceptance of human behaviour in all its forms i have watched it once and i want to watch it again a truly classic work of art 
great place to learn about the older jazz this series is fantastic many reviewers have criticized it as being dogmatic in its pandering to earlier styles of jazz while panning later ones this criticism is valid to some degree i think it provides a great service howerver despite its shortcomings i loved jazz since i was a child and started buying jazz records in the late s at the age of about nobody in my family had a great appreciation of this music at that time it was somewhat difficult to get a handle on the development of jazz through the swing period to the fusion period at that time the older stuff was generally out of print etc learing about bop was like an archeologist looking at shards of pottery so a documentary like this is great in this instance it advanced my knowledge of music before my time unbelievably i would recommend this highly it was also nice to watch the documentary with my elderly parents who grew up in the s and s it was great to share this with them i could not believe that they wanted to continue into the bop period watching the series i always thought they hated my records like that finally being from new orleans and surviving katrina it was great to see the new orleans culture treated with such respect 
i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
this is the lesson that should be learned by everyone i think mankind needs to learn to stop taking the lives of everyone and everything for granted would it be difficult to get children to watch a cartoon should we make kids watch this world wide the governments should be forced to watch it to realize that what they have done or allowed to be done was not so great either the end feels close doesn t it

cajun spice this colorful and fast moving film from director jim mcbride about an only slightly corrupt cop in the big easy and the pretty assistant district attorney sent to investigate the department is filled with cajun spice and atmosphere the lines between right and wrong are blurred like a rainy windshield in this lightning paced and very sexy cop film dennis quaid gives a terrific performance as remy mcswain a second generation cop who sold out early on in his career accepting it as the norm but not letting it hinder him from doing his job when the prim but sexy ellen barkin arrives on the scene in the form of d a anne osborne he attempts to wine and dine his way out of trouble as the bodies start piling up in an apparent drug war the charged encounters between remy and the shy anne blend seamlessly with some very brutal crime scenes and a lot of new orleans music to propel this film at a breezy and very enjoyable pace when remy s own corruption is exposed their relationship becomes more complicated when he tampers with evidence and gets off but her comment to him that he is no longer one of the good guys causes him to take a serious look at himself when cops are discovered to be behind all the recent drug trouble the answers will hit far too close to home a very unique cop thriller that manages to maintain a light and breezy ambiance throughout this is one of the most memorable films of its kind its spicy flavor goes down easy and makes you crave more a supporting cast that includes ned beatty john goodman and lisa jane persky offer fine support in this very seductive and one of a kind film you must see recent events have added a melancholy tone to this flavorful cop film one can only hope after rebuilding that a new chapter will be written in the city s storied and colorful history this excellent film gives a real feel for what makes it what it is pick this one up today 
if you love wild westerns you ll love this movie i love watching movies about billy the kid jesse james butch cassidy and more i m tired of movies about good guys here s a good one about the bad ones the outlaws of the wild west 
shocking and unforgettable admittedly i rented this out because of goran visnjic being in it but that wasnt the main reason as the opening scene unfolded i could see that this wasnt a film for the faint hearted that on the way to a wedding the mother of the bride is shot dead with the film progressing and the character of risto visnjicbecoming more important i felt myself being drawn into what was happening and could not help but be moved by the scenes of the orphanage to see how these children had been mixed up in a war that led them to losing their parents had me in tears whilst not an entertaining film i thought that it was well worth watching as it gave an insight no matter how small into what people had to go through the acting was great and only enhanced what was a brilliant film but one that left me shocked and upset

a little hokey but all the elements were there not a great retelling of the story some of the hollywood magic gets in the way but all the elements of peter and the wolf are captured 
very hilarious truely speaking this is a very hilarious episode must see for every one 
hbo does it again this was originally aired on hbo and it is just as great as it was then it is entertaining smart and educational this just like most hbo movies id amazin 
thoroughly entertaining this is a really good movie with an excellent excellent screenplay the movie begins with the birth of punk when a small roomful of people were fortunate enough to catch the sex pistols when they first came out changing the course of music and ends with the death of acid as tony wilson puts it in the film it is the story of manchester that begins when a group of young and idealistic local boys decide to screw london and its record companies and start producing their own records out of manchester and boy has music history benefited from this decision it s interesting to note that as these young lads on the forefront of the music scene in manchester began to age they become less idealistic as they were in their youth and more acknowledging of reality and its limits my only complaint is that i wish the movie could have had more on joy division and new order than on the happy mondays why did tony wilson ever sign a band that came in last place in manchester s battle of the bands the casting for this movie is outstanding as well two big thumbs up ps i don t know why they used the cover that they did for the dvd it really has nothing to do with the film 
magnificent action and thrills if they are bringing the high and the mighty to dvd finally then maybe it s time to unravel the complications surrounding this film and feature it on dvd so proudly we hail is one of the greatest of all war movies and because it is told from a woman s point of view so to speak it still had a male director in the person of mark sandrich it is sometimes ridiculed and derided usually by armchair critics who should walk a mile in a nurse s shoes before daring to denigrate her bravery under fire claudette colbert plays janet davidson an unusual choice for a nurse colbert eschews most of her usual glamor except for the san francisco embarkation and really gives herself to the part colbert is often good when she has to play against strong women and here sandrich surrounds her with a gallery of independent types the way francois ozon made catherine deneueve shine in the recent women janet is a born leader even though she can only be photographed on one side of her face which somewhat limits her utilitarian duty during battle scenes even covered with grime and jungle grease colbert still can turn heads and when she meets george reeves the sparks ignite hot enough to burn corregidor down to the ground veronica lake plays up her dark side playing lieutenant d arcy a time bomb just waiting to explode often seen as soignee and bewitching with that cute fringe of hair playing peekaboo with her eyes lake here is going for a cornell woolrich style vengeance against the japanese if tarantino had made kill bill in the s lake would have beat uma thurman in the role easily she s hotter than a pistol and she s ms paulette goddard has i think the most challenging role and i agree with other reviewers who say this is goddard s best part while colbert and lake really just occupy the same acting space throughout the movie goddard s character has to change so that viewers watch her mature from a fly by night flapper with only men on her mind to a woman with a heart who lives to help others not just impress them with her oomph it s harder than it looks to walk that line but goddard pulls it off without a whimper often cast as the sexpot pure and simple or the gold digging mantrap she apparently was in real life goddard is entirely persuasive in her role and like lake she s a natural at action scenes i want her to be my nurse her romance with kansas is kind of cute too all in all an underrated movie with the kind of plot that screws in deeper and deeper unbearably tight like das boot except set in the pacific 
still as good as i remember back in when i was in college we all sat in dining hall one night and sang the school house rock songs to each other there in our twenties all of us could well remember the music and lyrics taking these songs off the air was the worst decision for saturday morning cartoons ever made they are fun educational memorable instructive and their goal is not to get a parent to buy something well that explains why they are no longer on the air regularly i loved them as a year old and have never stopped along with the majority of my generation in fact when i sat through my law school class about how a bill becomes a law i could not get the quoti am a bill quot song out of my head and every time i hear someone describe a verb without using an adverb i have to wonder did they ever see lolly 
true love there are many nice scenes an dialoques in an affair to remember the screenplay renders perfectly the true love the story is very romantic nicky and terry met on a cruise and fell so madly in love with each other they had to go separate ways but decided to meet again after months to see if they are still in love they didn t meet then because of tragic circumstances but they met later and noticed that their love is very true there is also that beautiful opening song by vic damone

my favorite version of alice i saw this several times as a kid and it always stuck in my head it s a beautiful english production that has a definite melancholy bittersweet flavor that s missing from other adaptations really worth seeing it is a kid friendly version not really but smart teens may enjoy it great performances from ralph richardson peter sellers and fiona fullerton as alice 
a little morbid but i don t like sad movies but i have to say that this movie is really good the characters have depth and the storyline is intriguing

a movie for those lazy nights cuddled together with a loved one i q is a pleasant romantic comedy with a twist the uncle of the young woman the story is about is none other than the great genius albert einstein played brilliantly by the late great walter matthau set in the late fifties the story begins when catherine boyd meg ryan and her fianc e james stephen fry experience car trouble while riding around in his mg and seek assistance at a garage the garage mechanic ed walters tim robbins sees catherine and falls hopelessly in love with her of course ed s aspirations seem to be hopeless ed is a very good car mechanic but has no formal college education but in the spirit of all romantic comedies ed feels that the relationship has a chance if he can only meet her and spend some time with her when she accidentally leaves her pocket watch at the gas station he seizes the opportunity to try and see her again by personally returning the watch imagine his surprise when he knocks on the door and albert einstein answers surprisingly ed and professor einstein hit it off immediately ed is no scientific genius but he understands human nature and the importance of having fun in life two things that einstein feels are lacking in his niece s life which has been largely based on trying to emulate her uncle einstein is getting on in years and wants to make sure that she is happy and will be looked after properly when ed expresses the depth of his feeling einstein vows to help set things up einstein and his physicist friends who also dote on catherine decide to try and set ed and catherine up as a favor to both of them it turns out that the car mechanic pretends to be an amateur physicist to impress meg ryan ed allegedly develops a process to use cold fusion to power a spacecraft which during the cold war and the space race was extremely important however this process didn t exist catherine finds out that ed is a fraud and ed realizes that he must level with her if they are ever to have a true relationship the clever and romantic ways that these issues are resolved by einstein and his cronies and by ed and catherine themselves make up the remainder of the story the highlight of i q has to be the performance of walter matthau as einstein he has created an original character that seems totally different from the kind of roles he always played with jack lemmon ed and catherine are engaging as the young lovers and give us good on screen chemistry like they were meant for each other while this film is by nature light and predictable you will find it quite enjoyable entertainment one of my favorite lines from the movie is in a dialogue between albert einstein and tim robbins character ed they are discussing how to get catherine to go out with ed since catherine will only go out with intellectual types einstein the problem is she would never go out with a guy like you ed well that s easy lend me your brain for a while einstein are you thinking what i m thinking ed now what are the odds of that happening 
great sci fi if you like sci fi and enjoy a large scale presentation on a big home system this movie is haunting sad and powerful i do not understand the poor reviews by some unless they do not like sentimental and unhappy endings

rule of law determines whether a soldier is a barbarous or civilized defense argued law does not exist in the confederate prison therefore the raiders are not guilty of breaking any law these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive only rebel law applies in the prison outcries from other union soldiers were heard we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics what about us prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men protection against murder protection against theft the military jury found the six raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging the union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft however once intolerance levels are hit a violent revolution transpires the raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial however the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the raiders the great escape with mcqueen probably took its plot from andersonville the story line had a ton of similarities andersonville has a fair share of violence at one point the directors portrays the prisoners as zoombies in the land of the walking dead scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy abhorrence of the injustices and despair of the troops heroism abounds leaders reject traitorous offers to defect form their regiment about face and march away from on looking confederate admiral making offer factually men were imprisoned and about died from starvation disease and crime inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water over crowding of the prisoners no prisoner exchange and looting andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value as a civil war movie the characters were passionate compelling and captivating 
its a sin to be ashamed of what you are and it s a sin to lie about who you are made in douglas sirk s imitation of life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost years ago it s a real cinematic treat shameless tearjerker and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one s teenagers in this case daughters are growing up and preparing to enter the world lana turner has never looked more ravishing as lora meredith a young new york widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of broadway stardom together with her young daughter susie they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand tomouth existence their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams one day at coney island lora and susie meet another a white girl sarah jane who is being taken care of by a black woman annie johnson juanita moore whom lora mistakes for the maid when told by her that she s the mother the surprised lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child the angelic and virtuous annie asks lora if she can come and help out around the apartment lora is initially hesitant not because of annie s race but because she s struggling and doesn t have any money to pay her a wage eventually however she relents and tells annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night at the same time lora meets the extremely fine looking wannabe photographer steve archer john gavin steve takes an instant liking to lora and offers to marry her but lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage meanwhile the saintly annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white imitation of life follows these characters throughout their lives with sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get lora does indeed become a famous broadway actress yet neglects her growing daughter in the process steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization but has trouble relating to lora s need to be independent and famous annies heart is eventually broken gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter sara jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success the contrast of the mother s compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story s ultimate paradox lora annie steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other they all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn t seem to be doing them much good they are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them lora gets her career but she s unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother whilst sara jane perhaps the most damaged character achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother under douglas sirk s accomplished direction miss turner et al acts ornately and elaborately everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life especially lana s gorgeous outfits yet the film clocking in at over two hours is always compelling and is never boring the screenplay is sophisticated the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film the brilliant surfaces audacious colors and the spatial complexities of s moderne architecture bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy entrapment and emotional anxiety and where the price of following one s dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost mike leonard june 
master commander of the silent era having recently seen and thoroughly enjoyed master commander the far side of the world with russell crowe and its incredible depiction of life aboard an early th century frigate i felt compelled to trot out this silent classic from my vhs collection its not available on dvd and revisit this view of shipboard life i hadn t seen the film in quite some time and was surprised to note that several scenes in old ironsides are quite similar to scenes in master commander surely director peter weir must have screened this film before making his the battle sequences are very similar with sand being spread on deck to absorb blood the crew hitting the deck to avoid a volley young boys dying during the fighting and fierce close up hand to hand combat both movies are set during the same time period but the storylines are very different with the uss constitution old ironsides versus the barbary pirates being the setting here and in the classic hollywood tradition there is a woman involved charles farrell who was a big romantic lead in the s especially when paired with janet gaynor shows here why he was so popular he is vulnerable but heroic reserved but not stoic and he possesses an effortless charm that makes him appealing although playing the standard damsel in distress role esther ralston makes an engaging heroine who is not a total wimp when the going gets tough character actors wallace beery and george bancroft have a field day as feuding sailors while george godfrey is featured in a more significant role than black actors of the time were usually given add to that some brief nudity and a discreetly sexy performance from ralston she was once known as the american venus and you have a real winner on your hands the film is well directed by james cruze the covered wagon the great gabbo who is all but forgotten today due to most of his films being lost hopefully paramount will soon release this on dvd along with the others in their silent film series of a few years ago including wings until then this vhs version which features a beautiful print and a digitally recorded organ score by gaylord carter at an excellent price is certainly worth having 
live dangerously till the end a movie more famous for style than substance though it set the movie world on its head a third rate hood in paris jeanpaul belmondo who thinks he s bogart steals a car then kills the policeman who pulls him over now on the lam he goes to his girlfriend jean seberg and asks her to hide him until he can collect some money owed him from a previous job after that he tells her they will go to rome but seberg is as empty soul less and finally ruthless as he is and at the end she turns him in to the police but it s the way goddard relates the story that had everyone ga ga over this movie masterpiece he presented new ways of viewing his material fast cutting imaginative camera angles a total breakdown of time and space no transitions his idea was to give the impression of living in the moment there are some memorable scenes especially the bedroom scene with belmondo and seberg discussing art and philosophy and the final shot of seberg but at times it s very hard to relate to these two conscienceless amoral characters i know it s all about alienation and impetuosity but whew the location photography on the streets of paris is superb and set another precedent for new wave filmmaking excellent too is the musical score part jazz part classical it s an extremely influential movie groundbreaking and revolutionary though some of it s most creative techniques jumpcutting for example have become second nature today 
outstanding animated film i really love this movie the closest comparison would be the animated film heavy metal but this film has mellower music this film combines great storytelling with excellent music i did not care for his animated lord of the rings or wizards but this movie is one of my all time favorites a masterpiece 
witty funny movie gets the special treatment it takes a loan shark leading the way to make hollywood honest get shorty returns in a new disc collectors edition dvd just in time for the sequel too cool which will be premiering in theaters in march translating elmore leonard s novels to the screen can be a tricky business luckily both screenwriter scott frank and director barry sonnenfeld are both up to the task with an inventive dark comedic film chili palmer john travolta heads west to collect a debt from down andout b movie producer harry zimm gene hackman when harry can t pay chili opts to help him make a movie about well chili palmer the catch is that chili and harry need a star to make their movie viable chili quickly finds that the film business shares a lot in common with the world of organized crime chili romances b movie queen karen flores rene russo an ex of harry s and persuades film star martin weir danny devito to star in the film but not before running into a cadillac of very funny mishaps along the way featuring a great performances from dennis farina as the clueless ray bones barboni travolta hackman russo devito and a pre sopranos james gandolfini get shorty positively sparkles with wit and energy sporting a new high definition transfer get shorty looks simply marvelous with a sharp looking transfer showing a minimum of digital artifacts and no analog flaws get shorty deserves the deluxe treatment the image has amazing depth and an image sharper than chili s aim the colors practically leap out from the screen brighter than harry zimm s blindingly white teeth from the moment the pink and blue titles pop up on the screen until the moment we hear cut at the end with blacks richer and darker than chili s stolen coat mgm has done a superb job of translating this modern classic to dvd the crystal clear sound comes across with more presence than b movie queen karen flores screams extras are exceptionally good in this special edition it s like having seconds of a terrific desert while no one really needs it it s great to have just the same we get a number of notable extras as part of this rich meal the second disc has three featurettes on different aspects of the film the deleted graveyard scene outtakes the get shorty party reel a documentary from bravo channel on the making of the movie and a sneak peak at be cool get shorty look at me opens the book on how elmore leonard came up with the plot for get shorty and developed the idea devito travolta hackman russo sonnenfeld and other key cast and crew participate in this featurette on the production of the film full of clips from the movie to illustrate the points made throughout the featurette it s a great summation of the greatness of this film it s a minute love fest reminding fans why they love this movie so much the minute get shorty wise guys and dolls focuses on the fun complex characters of the movie the graveyard scene featurette allows sonnenfeld to comment on the single deleted scene of the movie included the hilarious well graveyard scene featuring a funny cameo with ben stiller sonnenfeld clearly regretted cutting the scene but sonnenfeld couldn t find a place for sequence where it fit the behind thescenes stuff and interviews last longer than the actual scene itself going again features footage from outtakes and a discussion from sonnenfeld about the technique of using long takes pulling out the best bits and putting it together to make magic the sneak peak for be cool promises that the sequel to get shorty promises to be as funny as the first film set in the music business it may not be more than a promo piece for the film but it gives viewers enough of a taste to rope em in bravos page to screen documentary featuring peter gallagher features plenty of interviews with critics other writers and focuses as much on how elmore leonard comes up with the material in his books writes them and once again takes us behind thescenes of the production of the movie the real treat is hearing from the real chili palmer discussing the reel chili palmer and leonard s character the party reel mainly consists of bits and piece of cut footage and behind thescenes stuff nothing earth shattering or all that funny in addition to the get shorty theatrical trailer and we get two promos one for fargo and one for the good the bad and the ugly my only complaint is the mgm promo opener that they put on all of their dvds it s annoying and unfortunately there s no way to pass it by it s a pretty minor issue but the fact that it s on all of their dvds makes it a real pain a dry witty commentary by barry sonnenfeld highlights this disc the only drawback is the lack of participation of travolta hackman russo and devito i realize they have busy schedules but it would have been a real highlight and perfect addition to this dvd a hip funny comedy that continues to deliver in spades get shorty looks terrific sounds great and has some terrific special features this is an example of a re release that s worth upgrading definitely worth owing on dvd and purchasing a second time if you love the movie this is the version to own 
i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
still great after all these years bob woodward one of the real life heroes in the movie is still making news while reporting news at the washington post that s amazing i used to be a reporter and still am a democrat although a moderate now and i never was a fan of president nixon so i loved it when it came out i loved the book first and i was glued to the tv set and the papers when the whole watergate mess unfolded but ignore politics if you can when watching this there are crooks in both major parties and and dumb people promoted above their talents this is well written well directed and well acted and can be enjoyed just as entertainment here in the new century sadly the clinton years and the bush years too offer the realization that watergate type conspiracies designed to hold onto power avoid scandal or launder money are still with us 
totally entertaining mind expanding scifi spectacle quotgalaxy being quot is the superb seminal episode of the original outer limits and it still packs quite a unique wallop today indeed all the more so by contrast with the dismal state of contemporary scifi cinema this is a towering all time great portrayal of the human encounter with the alien who is at once intelligent wise noble confused and stressed out his final stern lecture to the foolish frightened earthlings who in their ignorance would destroy him puts this film into the same class as quotday the earth stood still quot one of ol s most important thematic forerunners but then in a brilliant stroke there is a strong and daring infusion of emergent parallels between the rational and the non rational between recent discoveries of science and ancient intuitive mystical teachings way ahead of its time in another profound theme embodied in both the alien and the cliff robertson character is the courage of the individual who would seek to investigate the unknown against the pressures of brain washed society to conform and all the efforts of authorities to keep humanity subservient and under control should these loner visionary scientist types who break the rules in their quest for knowledge be careful what they re fooling around with of course and yet its often by mistakes that we learn the most and advance furthest as a species the special effects are stylish and riveting especially the design and imaging of the alien itself which has few comparisons the human alien relationship is mirrored as well by the maritally troubled husband wife couple who have their own differences to overcome the lame gender stereotypes of today s pathetic post cameronhurd scifi offerings ie the men as wimps or swaggering macho idiots and foils for the obligatorily smarter stronger wiser but good looking female lead are nowhere to be seen so you might not like this if you require that kind of shallow formulaic content the focus here setting the tone for the whole series is on the timeless and recurring themes of human existence the quest for meaning the finding of the self in the other transcendence versus domination the triumph of the human spirit and hope outer limits is the shakespeare of tv cinematic scifi and will admirably withstand the test of time by the way there is one unintentionally diverting moment here to watch for which i ve got to mention because i ve never seen it commented upon elsewhere it involves quite a double handful that cliff robertson gets hold of in the last act how did that get by abc s watchful eye 
halloween fans love them all sure it is no where near being as good as the original but as a fan of the halloween s i love them all including this somewhat cheesy attempt to keep the story going if you are going to believe that a man can be shot and blown up and all that other stuff and can still live on then you cannot complain about this flick plus it has great comedic one liners that will make you laugh my opinion is that is still better than half the crap they make nowadays 
loves long journey this dvd is excellent for all ages to watch it is a heart warming story that everyone should watch the books that these dvd are based on are great also 
ivan the wonderful i despite having been produced over years ago ivan the terrible remains one of the most bizarre and compelling movies ever made it is filmed in an ultra expressionist style despite the fact that expressionism had long passed its heyday in the s and early s nonetheless the style fits this almost gothic film perfectly religious and other symbols of power and authority are exaggerated transformed into grotesques the powerless peasantry mired in the darkest ignorance is presented as a frightening presence of menace ever lurking in the background waiting to be harnessed by the next tyrant ivan himself is depicted as an elongated nosferatu type character with a moral compass so convoluted as to be nonexistent the mixing of song dance numbers under the most monstrous circumstances toward the end of part ii only enhances the mesmerizing quality of the film it is said that stalin attempted to pressure the director to make this masterpiece more stalinist friendly but that the filmmaker courageously refused unfortunately almost all other films made during the stalinist era reflect the justifiably maligned dreary style called socialist realism 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
excellent again this product was really new like you always say it and there was no defect whatsoever also the picture quality was clear as well as the sound and i really want to thank you guys once again for the good job you do in reminding people for theirorders with you in conclusion i look forward to doing more businesswith you in the future and thank you for being one of earth s biggest selection on the planet

an artful representation of the life of jesus this movie is hands down the best narrative of the life of jesus it is long but i am never bored no matter how many times i watch it i grew up with this movie it would be on television every year around easter time as an adult i could not resist the desire to own it robert powell gives a powerful performance as jesus with his gentle demeanor and kind eyes quotes are taken right from the bible which in my opinion is a fantastic feature zeferelli did an amazing job 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
beauty and other charms of waking life the beauty in henry and june is full throttle there s the bike race through a sunlit forest there s a colorful bohemian festival with tribal dress and sexual opportunity there s a series of postcards accidentally discovered that picture erotic delights in the most sublime scene nin in a red dress dances to sensual rhythmic music and her face is given a fantastic close up all of the film s beauty all of its detail and technical mastery create a luscious idyll the film balances between dreams and waking life its rhythms vary and are a vital part of its narrative there are many moments in it when time slows focusing our attention on a mood or an object inviting our reverie the narrative depends as much on music color and editing as it does on dialogue each scene is thoughtfully made each part of each scene has been considered watching it we experience an intelligent world full of strong interesting personae nin and miller fearless and imaginative have high goals and appetites possibly insatiable miller is emotional articulate and experimental he appreciates the sensuousness of life he begs and at least once steals he struggles to write and to think for himself nin is his equal tenacious and curious sometimes cruel trying to understand her desires and trying to bring them to fruition watching two dancers with her cousin she says oh look at them eduardo they re so exquisite if i were a man i d be swept away at one point she writes in her diary i feel restless spirited adventurous to be absolutely truthful i hope secretly to meet someone else i have erotic imaginings i want pleasure beauty and strong characters give the film an essential lyricism and lightness for instance when june returns the extended scenes are nightmarish appropriately raw and claustrophobic but these scenes conclude in the fog the fog shifts the mood of the film from the sense of heat and the fire in the claustrophobic rooms to one of regenerative possibilities a drowsy dreamy shadow heavy world returned daylight follows and the sense of renewal suggested by the fog is made explicit and further elaborated by ensuing character development the beauty is constant and illuminating the characters seek their satisfactions from life stunningly accomplished director philip kaufman s fluid filmmaking is ultimately about delight

even the creator takes sides this is the creation of the poem to engrave drama in the hearts of man which culminates in the day war between the noble pandava princes and their scheming cousins the kaurava kings that decides the fait of mankind we see how free will and fait can co exist notice that krishna has an agenda that may or man not be that of the other players in the game even in the day war every rule is broken every value is destroyed leaving no difference between whom is good or who is evil who is an enemy or who is not as krishna does throughout the movie we see that the only way the pandava can win is to use any means the essence of the mahabharata was encapsulated in a hour play by peter brook then the play was adapted to this six hour visual media presentation visually and melodically stunning this presentation is so well presented that you hardly realize the effort that went into making this representation reflect the true mahabharata mahabharata literally means great maha india bharat yet its meaning is the story of mankind as one would see that mankind started in india there are other film and book versions of the story some better some not as good however this is a brilliant work and should not be missed in book form i suggest as a good starting place mahabharata the acclaimed new rendering of an immortal epic of war and destiny retold by william buck also do not over look the power of myth by joseph campbell bill moyers 
a great homage to the golden age this movie is fantastic it pays homage to the great monster movies of the golden age all the horror films of today have sunk to mindless gorefests instead of making you think the ultimate collector s edition is even better since it includes the original classis s dracula frankenstein and the wolf man ignore all the nay sayers and get this set just pop it into your dvd player and enjoy ! 
great potrayal of the infamous rogue trader this movie captures well the story of the rogue trader ewen macgregor does a superb job and manages to create some real tension you can almost feel the tension in your living room when you watch this one when he first made the money back you almost wish he would have stopped there but somehow like an addicted gambler continues on inventing ingenious ways to cover up and get more money to trade all the cast does a good job the locations are also excellent an underrated excellent movie and well worth a look if you have even the slightest interest in finance or banks 
this has been a love story i finally made my first purchase from amazon s unbox video downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience for i purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of the twilight zone and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection i don t think it s the most ideal way to see full length motion pictures but for a minute classic tv program i think my lcd monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean aired on september as the show s third season opener the episode is a cold war fantasy appropriately called two about the last two survivors on earth a man and a woman after an apocalyptic world war in written and directed by tv veteran montgomery pittman the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an american infantryman and she is an invading russian soldier like two feral animals they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him the reality of their solitary existence however gradually dawns on them especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue prekrassnyi the russian word for lovelywhat really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting two years before she twitched her nose on bewitched a brunette elizabeth montgomery looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun plays the untrusting russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability the american is played by perennial tough guy charles bronson fresh from the magnificent seven even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism they make an odd couple but it works splendidly i also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the nd century narrated by rod serling in his inimitably halting manner the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript this has been a love story this is classic tv

great movie to satisfy all tastes in forbidden games a capricious little girl named paulette gets her parents killed then meets michel dolle a boy not much older than herself who s willing to satisfy her every wish dolles welcome paulette into their family while she and michel forge a strange bond paulette is fascinated by death and the act of burying so michel who treats paulette as a kind of pampered pet devotes all his time to creating a private cemetery just for her when the children s grotesque game goes too far the adult world threatens to separate them forbidden games is a great movie that somehow manages to be cynical and unrelenting in its realism even as it stays sweet and sentimental on the surface the way this movie weaves drama social commentary and comedy into a perfectly subtle and disturbing little fable reminded me of another great french title released by criterion le corbeau watching forbidden games will almost certainly make you want to see other films by rene clement 
my comedy collection one of my very fav movies love it as much now as when i first saw it way back in s 
a blast from start to finish plus a message maybe i just don t get it but i ve loved this film ever since i first saw it in the eighties and was mesmerized and thrilled by the opening sequence of mr gere practising drumming on a practise drum skin to the music of benny goodman s version of sing sing sing with gene krupa drumming an opening sequence does not a movie make but i knew i was in for an exciting ride with mr lumet who has rarely failed to thrill me from his first film twelve angry men and thereafter with prince of the city the anderson tapes dog day afternoon network et al in power part of the deal is to go with it that is willingly suspend disbelief and take the dramatic ride for my own part the ability of pete st john mr gere to manipulate public opinion and get politicians elected has more than a touch of truth about it and the relish with which st john does his job is fascinating to see he s a professional without a principled bone in his being and mr gere ironically a professed budhhist is brilliant playing that character he survives one of the great lines he gives to his ex lover played by ms julie christie is dont blame yourself those in the film who have principles either commit suicide senator played by the great mr e g marshall descend into embarrassing alcoholism mr hackman playing a rival media adviser wonderfully comic or suffer the apparent loneliness and unremunerative fate of the loser ms christie though that might be stretching it a bit i can t think of a parallel to this film but primary colors or network come close although this film is superior to it mr maltin and i guess many others have got it badly wrong with this film as i consider it one of the best political films of all time it s a blast from beginning to end fuelled by some of films greatest actors including denzel washington superb set design pungent writing and great direction not to mention gene krupa s drumming then again maybe i just don t get it 
great dvd a christmas classic must have i have always seen this movie on regular tv so to see it on dvd with the original language was fabulous 
incredibly alluring audrey hepburn and gary cooper make an unlikely pair for a lot of reasons in this film but that does not stop the relationship from working it sizzles audrey is a young parisian girl the daughter of a private investigator played by maurice chevalier she is young beautiful innocent and plays the cello and is a bit bored she treats herself to adventure by reading the case files of her father a good proportion of these case files involve the character played by gary cooper he is a rich american playboy who is always got women often these women are married cooper is the single largest source of income for chevalier and chevalier cannot help be admire his style having gypsy musicians on call to serenade the mark day and night is just one example when hepburn learns that an outraged husband plans to kill cooper she secretly goes to warn the lovers in doing so she falls for cooper herself and manages to arouse his interest she knows that any sort of clinging will just turn him off so she tries to play his own strategy against him she plays the mysterious playgirl with more beaux than she can count she will not even give him her name the strategy works cooper falls for her in a big way but still she remains silent in desperation cooper hires a private investigator to learn more about her naturally this would be her father things do not work out as expected but they do work out well hepburn portrays beauty and innocence and not a little female cunning she is a delight to behold so are cooper s fits of uncertainty chevalier lends the whole episode a degree of class and dignity it s a first fate story all around 
mysterious symbols ok i understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters they are the traditional mars and venus symbols representing masculinity and femininity i also understand the last symbol representing infinity a never ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever or maybe the propagation of eternal life by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity but what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values the star of david representing judaism and a cross representing christianity i haven t seen the movie in years but i don t remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot please also forward your thoughts to vboston at aol com 
noir with cowboy boots western noir and it s pretty good angular shadowy black and white photography by james wong howe the story told in flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks with the resigned narration of robert mitchum a relentless villian a hidden family mystery that might contain hints of incest plus gunfights and new mexico scenery mitchum and theresa wright are very good as the possibly doomed couple wright seems to me to always have had a quotnice girl next door quot air about her that i think obscured what an excellent actress she was not just in best years of our lives but look at her in the little foxes where in her first movie she holds up very well with bette davis the men and shadow of a doubt she knew how to deliver a line dean jagger was almost as ubiquitous a character actor in the late forties and fifties as thomas mitchell had been in the thirties and forties jagger usually it seemed to me mostly played decent good guys or well intentioned weakings and with deliberate speech it was good to see him play so effectively a decisive spoken out andout bad guy the dvd transfer is very good but no extra 
lack of love demonstration this is a great film with a great cast and very well directed the core of the story is the lack of love demonstration by the great santini for his family in spite of his deep love for them ! it s touching the way that santini feel but can t show love for his great wife and kids the wife role is very well played and is the cement that bonds all the characters together ! 
diet for a new america great book actually the second time i ve bought it and read it a great eye opener

mr chang and his shangri la when i heard this film lost horizon was being painstakingly restored and with much more footage found in the vaults after seeing some of the footage i thought i had to see it some day they say every film student and movie buff should see it the fact that actress jane wyatt father knows best tv series and reunion tv movie also played spock s mother in a star trek episode and star trek the voyage home also appears in the film peaks my interest this version is with the complete hours minutes soundtrack with only minutes of found footage put back into the film since more minutes of footage was never found this is replaced by photography stills and freexe frame images i won t say anything about the plot but this dvd package does contain a nice pamphlet containing the restoration work they have done on this film jane wyatt s swimming nude scene is included dvd includes subtitles in spanish portuguese chinese korean thai theatrical trailer special trailer include an alternate ending restoration before and after comparison with deleted scenes of jane wyatt photo documentary restoration audio commentary jane wyatt just passed away october at the age of of natural causes shangrila was actually a hollow set at columbia ranch near perduco and hollywood way in burbank california the site is now the burbank town center mini mallremade in in color with an all star cast with liv ullmann sally kellerman george kennedy michael york olivia hussey bobby van

heartwarming romantic moving on comedy a lovely and wonderful film it s a comedy that s light and will make you smile but it does speak of very true to life situations and tugs at the heart making one run the gamut of emotions especially for anyone who has ever had someone you love leave you for someone else and being left to deal with it it also touches on other true problems such as about caring too much about the opinions of others importance of family unconditional love and life in general a light but touching movie that will give a touching experience and have you walking away with a smile very satisfying 
great opener to a great series i especially like the maverick episodes that emphasize humor and this one has many clever scenes the highlight for me was seeing bret sway the election to the ex judge however i have to side with phineas in the poker game at the beginning no way i let maverick bet with a sealed envelope 
guaranteed to be one of the most thought provoking films you ve ever watched there is little a reviewer can say about ingmar bergman s film det sjunde inseglet the seventh seal that hasn t already been said its plot of a knight playing chess with death has been so widely alluded to or parodied that it securely has a place in the canon of classic films and enough praise has been heaped on it that it s quite obviously a masterpiece in spite of the inevitability of repetition the film invites effusive comment the struggles of the knight antonius block max von sydow to find meaning in his doomed life stands in the spotlight for most viewers on the first run throug but bergman s script is of such depth that there s always more thought provoking facets to be found block is gripped by an existential crisis at the thought of death his squire jons gunnar bjrnstrand and the traveling couple and acting partners jof and mia nils poppe and bibi andersson on the other hand each react differently to the mortal fate common to all which one should the viewer identify with or is it possible to find some other way of confronting the inevitable bergman claims that filming det sjunde inseglet let him find peace and if the film won t give comfort to all it surely confronts all with a question that must be answered acting here is of the highest order gunnar bjornstrand was commonly cast in severe upright roles for example as a priest in bergman s later chamber film nattvardsgaesterna winter light here however he plays a bawdy commoner who lives for wine women and song while bengt ekerot generally continues the traditional portrayal of death as a dark threatening character he adds just the right amount of droll humour to the role to comment on the knight s search for meaning in an absurd world and the climax where the straightforward narrative fades and the theoretical musings of each character are made real the knight praying in torment and the squire acting as his foil one last time but more convincingly than ever well it s a tour de force one of the most memorable films i ve ever seen just like for so many of the rest of the reviewers here det sjunde inseglet is a must see film 
a different travolta movie this is a little different that what some may expect from travolta enough action and twists to keep it interesting 
a time to think grisham once said he wrote his other books e g the firm et al so he could afford to write important books like this one upon which the movie s based matthew mcconaghey gives a fantastic performance and why hasn t hollywood ever evergiven him another part this good ! thought provoking great acting great story highly recommen 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography 
the rainmaker it s a good story it keeps the pace moving and inserts nice little scenes of humor and the best part it s so close to the actual book 
awesome movie i highly recommend this movie was really great i could not take my eyes off of the television i usually fall asleep during movies but not this one this is about issac the undercover fbi character was a complete confusion of motives and suggested unintended multiple personalities clips of bobby kennedy and mlk are injected into the middle of the film to substantiate the popular call for a lottery based draft martin mull as a lead fbi agent does an great job the film is has songs from that era and the songs are awesome 
awesome episode scooby doo rocks ! this was an awesome episode and an awesome way to download some of the earlier episodes of scooby fun stuff and an inexpensive download 
for gangster film aficionados the film dillinger charts the rise and fall of notorious gangster john dillinger the story presented distills his elaborate career but some of the salient details are included dillinger s involvement with baby face nelson for example is not mentioned once but that is probably due to the fact that we are supposed to concentrate on the story of dillinger and not suffer distraction with the crimes of another notorious gangster in the film john dillinger lawrence tierney begins his criminal career as a petty crook but a botched robbery sends him to prison here dillinger connects with career criminals and he s admitted to their gang dillinger is released and then plans a bold jailbreak for the rest of the gang now on the loose the gang begins a series of bank robberies soon dillinger is on the fbi s most wanted list when the film begins tierney plays dillinger as not very bright but he soon shifts into the seasoned stone cold killer whose methodical violence created headline after headline dillinger s character as defined by the film does not permit any explosive scenes so tierney s performance can t match lets say paul muni in scarface or richard widmark as tommy ugo in kiss of death a fascinating character here is helen rogers anne jeffreys dillinger s girlfriend the gangster s moll who loads up on expensive gee gaws while conveniently ignoring the source fans of gangster films will want to catch this one if it s possible to track down a copy displacedhuman

beautiful funny movie great grusin score after revisiting this beatty masterpiece i agree with everything in the other reviews this is in my top movies and definately number or in romantic comedies i must mention the musical score by dave grusin although grusin has done tons of great stuff for some reason the haunting melodies of heaven can wait have always stuck with me through the years absolute perfection ! i don t believe a soundtrack cd is available but grusin has revisited the themes from heaven can wait on his cinemagic full orchestra and now playing solo piano cd s i highly recommend both beatty hit a home run with this one the writing acting directing and cast all perfect the great soundtrack is just icing on the cake enjoy 
blood curling well i saw this movie the first time when i was but a boy maybe ten or twelve years old and it frightened me to death though there was no gruesome monster to be seen only a shadow once i believe and the final words were in italian scrutate il cielo observe the sky in the meaning to detect anything unnormalmany years later i still revered the movie i realised that i was just becaus youjust never saw the monster that it was so terrifying only the first alien movie by ridley scott exude such claustrophobic helplessness something quite unfamiliar for the species homo sapiens sapiens to be well game i guess ah yes and carpenters prince of darkness next to some george romero zombie movies but the thing is the best black and white horror movie it was just left to your own imagination and that speaking with freud will come up with something really mean i tip my hat to howard hanks ! 
the frontier mentality i saw this movie last year and came away wondering what all of the praise was for i enjoyed a lot of it but i kept asking myself whose paying the bill i tend to get a bit too pragmatic at times and that has ruined a number of movies for me over the years i suppose that i should just accept that idea that whatever government these guys were working for was footing the bill however watching these guys risks their lives and planes daily to cross the mountains with somebody else s mail i didn t get it that aside it is a pretty good movie cary grant is the ultimate man with a mission he runs the operation and seems devoid of emotion he somehow manages to ignore jean arthur why is she in this movie but deserves an academy award for ignoring rita hayworth there s plenty of other types of action though these flyers live by a code and refuse to say cant be done all this brings me back to the question of why also the question of how did the guy get up to the mountain top lookout post i guess my need for a purpose left me missing the point about men who needed no purpose other than a barely acheivable challenge 
post world war ii comes to life mgm style one of the most familiar images of an mgm musical would be gene kelly frank sinatra and jules munshin dressed as sailors singing the catchy words new york new york s a wonderful town the bronx is up and the battery s down the people ride in a hole in the ground new york new york it s a wonderful town while the song by leonard bernstein is from a broadway musical called on the town it is mgm s adaptation broadway lovers may refer to it a usurpation that makes the song immortal today on the town tells the story of three sailors the lovable somewhat cocky but sincere gabey gene kelly his clueless friend chip played by frank sinatra and the bumbling ozzie jules munshin who are on leave in new york city for a day the three take a taxi where the driver hilde betty garrett falls madly in love with chip she wants to ditch the other two sailors to be with her new found love but the chip will not abandon his two friends ozzie finds love when visiting the museum of natural history when he meets the intellectual claire ann miller gabey has yet to find the love of his life a woman he knows only as miss turnstiles from a subway poster he believes she is a famous new york celebrity but discovers she is a hometown girl there are also antics that would seem silly to a moviegoer today the taxi company believes the taxi has been stolen a skeleton of a dinosaur is damaged at the museum a police chase ensues still mgm a studio that turned making unbelievable worlds into reality into an art form does the same with this film there are many reasons this film is considered a classic while most of the musical numbers from the original broadway score were believed to be too sophisticated for movie musical audiences and replaced with what some consider inferior music mgms saul chaplin once said looking back he could hardly believe that bernstein s music was replaced somehow the score does work the dancing numbers are great much of the film a radical idea at the time was shot on location which makes the city almost a character in the film vera ellen fans love this film because it showcases her talent bewitched fans will also enjoy the performance of alice pearce as lucy shmeeler hilde s unlucky in love and chronic cold suffering roommate and back up romantic partner for gabey this dvd is a just the film and its special features include just a trailer of the movie it s a fun movie to watch and brings a viewer back to a time when the world was changing and a sense of optimism was real 
u rattle and hum dvd i love this movie i can watch it over and over again and still get the chills i wish i had been able to see u then when their shows were so full of energy than now when they ve really toned it down the film is fun because you get to see not only performances but also things behind the scenes larry s obsession with elvis and interviews where they poke fun at each other 
beautiful film most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is i am a long time u fan and had seen rattle and hum but didn t get around to purchasing the dvd until late the fact that the music is wonderful is a given but the cinematography is just astounding i love how you get to see everything from every point of view you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage including the breathtaking sea of fans you get to see what the fans see the spectacular lighting and silhouettes you get to hear what the guys think and feel off stage as well as on and of course you get the passionate music the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to i couldn t ask for more

excellent movie this is a great movie acting may be a little light but the action and story make up for it 
dangreous and hot ivy is the new crazy girl in school sylvie is the lonesome geeky rich girl once ivy and sylvie meet they become pretty good pals sylvie invites her to ride home she also invites ivy into her house she was making a deadly mistake anyone can tell that something is definitely odd about ivy but she is charming to anyone around her sylvie s sick mother is always depressed but when ivy comes along sylvie s mother starts to love ivy sylvie s dad is really starting to get closer to ivy too but sylvie herself starts to regret the day that she talked to ivy because ivy is starting to ruin her life but ivy wants to stay in sylvie s house and whatever ivy wants ivy gets this movie was really entertaining throughout the whole thing and it always kept you wondering what horrible thing that the misuderstood ivy was going to do next you were always trying to understand ivy wanting to know more about this strong character this movie was chilling and definitely sexy and overall it s a good film 
one of the best documentaries out there this is a movie that most people can connect with we all have known a stevie in our lives you know the angry loaner hates the world and everyone in it he desperately craves attention and respect after years of abuse and torment even with the bitterness you want to help stevie but stevie doesnt realize or understand that his tough guy redneck persona is self destructive he brags of past arrests and fights like they are badges of honor friends and relatives shake their heads because they dont know how to help him drugs mental hospitals religion have all failed him in his eyes the bottom line is this is a movie that will stay with you for a very long time especially if you have known a stevie in your life 
a masterpiece this movie is truely one of the crowning achievements of the s pauly shore should have won the oscar i wish there were more movies like this one 
absolutely riveting no this isn t courtney of friends but once you get past that this is must watch tv ! while the show has content that can be shocking it is so well written and edited it all fits it is definitely a sequential drama and makes much more sense watching the episodes back to back that fleshes out the characters so you start to care about and understand them courtney shows her acting chops best at those moments when she is silent and lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog is a bit stilted the best character is the functional schizophrenic photographer don konkey he is exhibits an endearing combination of weirdness loyalty insight and sweetness to become the break out star of this series if you only watched one episode and wrote this one off go back and watch a few back to back and you may just find yourself addicted 
this movie is very nice thanks to the tivo off trial i was able to easily pick a movie while i was away from home and watch it on my tivo at home later that evening would i pay to do it again not i already have a netflix account and watch an average of movies over the course of a month if i pay amazon each for those same movies i would go broke very fast get the price down to and you ll have my business 
revenge of the anti sith the spiritual opposite of star wars iii revenge of the sith transcends sci fi genre with a focused look at the essence of warriorhood and what is sacrificed to create a perfect killer the evolution of the kurt russell character is a touching transformation from a souless storm trooper to a true citizen soldier in the ideal american tradition but there s nothing textbook preachy about it a lot of visual flash and pizzaz considerable tension and unpredictable twists because things could easily go either way including the ending 
you ve gotta love jon stewart i like drew barrymore but my reason for renting this movie was jon stewart jon has a terrific comedic timing and he shines whenever he s on screen a proof of that is that the daily show got much much better since he started hosting it as for this particular movie it has a slow start and the first part is the hardest to get through but once we move on to the second things start connecting and culminate in a sweet ending where everything falls in place and of course jon has his winning charm on

refined but difficult rating and reviewing movies like these are often difficult for the average critic on one hand they re done absolutely brilliantly done in ways that take one s breath away on the other hand how much credit can you give to a movie that is pure propaganda especially propaganda for something the reviewer doesn t agree with this realistic re enactment of the events of october th is actually anything but realism instead it is a harrowing and amazing romantic experience this is not to say it s bad its brilliant ! the direction and editing on this film are much more refined than eisenstein s previous and much moreheralded film brenonsets potyemkin battleship potemkin and it has a whole lot more symbolism and focus on literary devices his fast paced cutting is not as disjunctive as previously instead it works to shock the viewer with the juxtapositions i don t think i shall ever get the quick back andforth cutting between that one soldier s face and the firing machine gun ever out of my mind it s just that powerful this movie is so good in fact that it makes me proud to be a bolshevik and i m not not in any way or form ! how s that for being a powerful well done movie the birth of a nation didn t effectively make me proud to be a klansman for a comparison because of its intense political alignment i can t see everyone appreciating this film there will always be those out there who say ah it s only communist propaganda which is right so it s not even worth watching which is wrong for those who are looking for a magnificent cinematic experience however this movie is a fine choice indeed polarisdi

a must see i have long owned the three tape vhs version of this title in the days before david shephard et al put out all those magnificent restorations and before warner bros rereleased some early chaplins this series was the only place to find high quality chaplin films albeit not complete and incredible outtakes i can t recommend this series enough to any chaplin fan my pre order is on file ! 
one of the best movies i ve seen in a long time many reviewers on this site have said that they would want to see a film that focuses on the hardships and extremes that immigrants face when coming to the united states to this i respond we ve seen that hundreds of times in films the same goes for sports films we ve seen the movie glory road in other films like coach carter remember the titans and hoosiers they are exactly the same movie with a different team that s not to say that these films aren t decent sports flicks but the film industry needs to take a step back when making a film that has the potential to be just like every other film in its genre that being said that is exactly what jim sheridan does with in america the story is so original and the acting makes this film a glorious triumph the basic story follows a family of irish immigrants who come to america with the same notion that all immigrants have to attain the american dream but as they all sooner or later find out the american dream is an ideology that of people never attain they have trouble finding a place to stay and end up with an apartment at the top of a run down building with many of its residents being junkies the father johnny paddy considine is a struggling actor who hasn t been able to get a part since the death of his son frankie who fell down the stairs the mother sarah samantha morton takes a job at an ice cream parlor to earn the rent money the oldest daughter christy sarah bolger is probably one of the smarter people in the film and sarah bolger gives a flawless performance for such a young girl she is the stereotype of the oldest child who is forced to grow up too soon her younger sister ariel played by sarah bolger s younger sister emma is the typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions about everything there are some really touching scenes throughout the course of the film one especially comes to mind where the father almost squanders away all of the family s money trying to win an e t doll for the youngest daughter there are essentially three miracles in the film and christy who is also the narrator relates these three events to a set of three wishes that her brother frankie told her about before he died the other great scenes in the film involve the family and their relationship to the man on one of the floors below when they first arrive in the house christy calls him the man who screams this man s name is mateo played brilliantly by djimon hounsou and he is a brilliant artist with quite a bit of emotional problems he is sort of the figure of morality in the film often giving out endless amounts of advice mateo has some sort of disease we can only expect that it is probably a venerial disease and he gets sick throughout the movie in america features one of the best ensembles i have ever seen every actor is perfect in every scene djimon hounsou and paddy considine give the best performances in the entire film and jim sheridan wrote and directed every gorgeous shot of the film while i do agree with one other reviewer about how christy has a modern camera in a story set in the eighties stupid facts like these should not detract from the overall message of the film the overall message then is not just about how immigrants face hardships when they come to america we already know that from previous films and or experiences the film has such a deeper message relating not just to immigrants but to every person who watches this film i really do not want to give the message away but rather i will leave it up to you to go rent or buy this treasure of a film this is truly one of the most unforgettable movies i have ever seen 
it s a dancehall thing my husband and i have watched this movie at least times my husband liked it so much that he can even recite some parts of it the characters are interesting the dancing and music is great and the story line kept our attention 
a classic i ve watched this movie for the seventh time recently and still can t get enough i bought the dvd knowing that i ll want to watch it again and again highly recommended 
great ocean shots in the bahamas i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation the cover appealled to me for these reasons and i admit i was not at all disappointed in the movie the scenery was indeed spectacular the underwater diving snorkling scenes were clear crisp and just what the doctor ordered even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful ok enough of the shallow stuff the movie was indeed much like the s flick the deep which i enjoyed back then as well the characters of jared and sam were pretty believable poor honest and happy folks most of us would love to really be this happy let s face it the introduction of bryce played by scott caan really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers twists etc overall the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives would i want to deal with tiger sharks no but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring job every day 
great classic film this film tugged at all of my emotions i was angry dissapointed and sad this is a must see for everyone of any age its one of my favorites 
a tearjerker plus much more i would give sarah plain and tall stars ! it is funny and it has drama and a little action too it would be good to read it to your son or daughter and brother or sister but make sure you have a box of tissues nearby because it might make you cry when i read it i got into the book and all it did was make me laugh and cry i bet if you get this book you won t have to get your money back 
kind of surreal over the course of minutes we see uganda s army run a faux invasion of the quotgolan heights quot amin dada lecture physicians about drunkeness and a meeting of amin s cabinet where he blasts his foreign minister who was executed soon after filming for the negative portrayal of his regime in the world press it s hard not to laugh at amin when he claims that he can command crocodiles or tells a large group of educated doctors that the people of uganda won t respect them if they are drunks then you remember this same man killed of his own people and some of the laughs get a little uneasier i think what fascinates people about amin is how he could simultaneously be so ruthless and yet so buffonish certainly this documantary in which some of the shots admittedly were set up by amin himself is a good demonstration of the latter and hints towards the former by the way this is a great print of the film and criterion even includes a minute plus interview with schroder recalling anecdotes about the making of it 
we gonna have ourselves a car chase today i guess that is the point of this movie but there is a little more to it kowalski played by barry newman is a car runner that always delivers his cars on his drive there he gets chased by a bunch of cops but he drives a dodge challenger so nobody will catch him his back story is explained in a few scenes of how he used to be a cop and a race car driver everything in the movie is very interesting but the car chases are the thing that is going to hold your attention well also the naked woman riding the motorcycle you have to like her too the dvd gives us the uncut uk version and wow what a difference also a commentary by the director was a real treat to listen to 
master harold and the boys if you need convincing that matthew broderick is a fine actor this is the film you must see 
where did this wonderful movie come from i watched this movie yesterday for the first time and i was completely blown away by the magnitude of michael keaton s performance i honestly think that he should have been a contender for an oscar in but do not even recall seeing the movie in theaters back then how does a great movie like this get lost in the shuffle the entire premise of the movie is to make people think about the quality of life while they are living it and hopefully not to wait until dying to make things right with family and loved ones i know i came away with valuable wisdom after seeing this beautiful film 
paddy by george we need to bring paddy chayefsky back to life but it ll never happen if he ends up in this place the novelist playwright and screenwriter penned some of the best and most acidic scripts in hollywood history including marty the bachelor party network and even the underrated altered states few if any however were better than the hospital a dark comedy about a manhattan hospital being terrorized by a mad killer george c scott absolutely devours the screen as dr herb bock the suicidal chief surgeon who has lost his wife his kids and his desire to serve mankind until that desire gets rekindled along with other desires by diana rigg whose visions tell her to get her father out of scott s hospital before the machinery of medicine does away with him it s refreshing to revisit highbrow satires such as this from an age when scriptwriters were allowed to assume intelligence in the viewer and the ideas don t seem watered down for consumption by the lowest common denominator the mysterious murderer is a bit of a throwaway but the inhumanity of modern healing was never so bleakly funny or considering that it s only gotten worse in the last years so scary 
totally psychotic totally psychotic wedding dress designer kills his models to find himself but his horrible wife has her own willpower to wield bava s direction parallels the edge of john s insatiable drive to kill an assaultive film experience low budget horrible sound so play it loud ! 
classic in its own right i dont know what its like to have gone to school in the s or have gone to school in the united states but i can still relate to this movie this movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story only fashion and accessories would be different everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie i would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now it may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie it gains momentum as it moves along and by the end after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied being a small cast all your attention is focused on the individual characters the students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant each actor plays their part perfectly while there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons they will all probably be most remembered for this movie with the exception of emilio estevez but special mention must go to judd nelson who i believe is the biggest star of the film his part was originally intended for either nicholas cage or john cusack who would have also been great but i m glad judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities it is a shame the dvd lacks many special features all you get is a trailer and cast bios i was desperately seeking an audio commentary or at the very least production notes however there are some interesting facts noted on imdb a teen movie for the s generation anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic

great show bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining 
get quotgunquot i have watched the video of quotmy new gun quot three times and each time i have discovered more interesting telling details the plot doesn t drive the film instead it seems to evolve almost by happenstance from the characters themselves although there is no quotcrackmeupquot humor at all if you think about what is going on as it happens this movie is hilarious diane lane james legros and stephen collins all shine 
easy st time trainer we raise chesapeake bay retrievers and have used this video amp the corresponding book before the video was available for each of our dogs it is straightforward amp easy to go one step at a time by stopping the video after each section the instructions are clear amp concise and only require you to work your dog for min twice a day it starts off with choosing a pup all the way to a finished retriever it does not however include instructions on field trialing this is strictly a video that enables the viewer to train their dog to duck hunt with them well amp efficiently good tool to have especially for the hunter who s training for the first time and a good reminder for the old hats 
jimmy dean there are no words to describe this film but that it is timeless i first saw this film on amc classics or turner classics back in the s not sure but i was captivated by james dean he embodied the true rebellion of a teenager and being the outsider the tough guy with a big heart watching it now restored and remastered on a two disc edition makes it that much better i am not a huge fan of classic films besides hitchcock and stanley kubrick films i love this timeless tale 
this movie is ridiculous funny crazy you might want to be sure to watch it first before you buy it its terrible b movie material but so bad it s actually good 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
enticing sexy dip into film noir waters the lady from shanghi s reputation is secure as a classic of film noir but then this genre is notoriously disrespected probably because many film noirs are based on dime novels and sound like it in order to appreciate a film noir therefore you have to be able to enjoy the kitschy quality of snappy dime novel dialogue but kitsch alone is not what makes some film noirs great what really sets film noir apart from other genres is its striking even elegant visual style which often contrasts sharply with its stark subject matter film noir has a way of glamourzing corruption and giving corruption a unique aesthetic allure all its own film noir probably owes something to the german expressionist film masters murnau lang von stroheim and the hollywood grotesques of the s and s but it absorbs and evolves these influences into a highly refined style of its own orson welles is the undisputed master of the high noir style all of his films after magnificent ambersons mobilize film noir methods and techniques and so welles reputation rises and falls with that genre that he did not create but that he perfected film noir came of age during wwii and like many film noirs lady from shanghai is about anxieties over race class sexuality and identity and in this particular noir film negotiating racial social cultural and sexual difference in an increasingly globalized world the film takes place in several international acapulco and exotic chinatown settings and these strange locales allow welles to examine how his characters respond to a diverse array of atmospheres and social cultural settings welles himself plays the central character in the film michael o hara and to do so he affects an irish accent another international touch that some critics argue is supposed to sound false inauthentic o hara has a way of talking that sounds a bit too self consciously literary and though he affects a working class worldliness his yarns sound like they come straight out of conrad ohara echoes many of conrad s colonial concerns and hemingway ohara echoes hemingway s anti franco sentiments and so we suspect that this character has spent more time reading and writing stories than in actually working whether we believe michael s irish brogue is authentic or not we know that he is fond of creating fictions and this casts suspicions on his identity as well as on his version of events that we hear on the voiceover furthermore we can see that his obsession with literature has given him a taste for the romantic and the typically masculine posturing of his favorite literary heroes and instead of making him worldly wise this just makes him all the more gullible when a pretty lady and the promise of a new adventure come along elsa played by welles then wife rita hayworth identifies michael as an easy mark the first time they meet unlike michael elsa actually is worldly and we can tell she s seen and experienced a lot and that she knows a lot about the world not just read a lot about it and she sees through michael s pseudo brogue and bravura right away and knows exactly how to exploit his romantic tendencies she sums him up and plays him from the first moment they exchange knowing glances hers much more knowing than his michael prides himself on his independence and his integrity but he just can t help falling for elsa s pretend innocence and helplessness its just too good to resist and he can t help wanting to come charging to her rescue even though there are signs everywhere that indicate that elsa is in no need of rescuing at first michael resists her job offer but she is a woman who always gets her way and soon michael is one of her employee servants just like all of the other men in the film michael just can t tear himself away from elsa s dangerously seductive corruptive charms that he willingly and perhaps willfully misinterprets as innocence and helplessness only because that version of her makes him feel better about his own true motives michael has been hired on as an extra hand on elsa s husband s yacht and as soon as he steps foot on deck everyone else aboard sizes him up and begins figuring how they can use him to further their own plots elsa s husband bannister is a famous lawyer and both he and his partner grisby are like michael under elsa s spell and trying to plot their way out of captivity as the yacht pulls out of harbor we see the word circe written in bold letters on the yacht s hull elsas past is a secret only hinted at all we know is that she was born on an island somewhere in the east spent some time in shanghai she looks like the penultimate american blonde but she is not from america and her cultural reference points are decidely eastern in contrast to michael s western points of reference to michael she represents the unknown and perhaps the unkowable and this is part of her allure and also what makes her so dangerous elsa is the prototypical femme fatale and the conventions of the film noir genre tell us that things will not end well for anyone that gets too close but she s just too enticing the most famous scene of the film has elsa in a sleek black bathing suit diving off some perilous rocks as if she were accustomed to such danger and as if danger was her natural element but then she lays down to sunbathe on the rocks and from the relative safety of the boat michael looking on anxiously aware of how dangerous she is can allow himself the comforting illusion that she is vulnerable and that she needs saving and that only he can save her not only from all the other male predators on board but save her from her own eastern imbued fatalistism elsa is so beautiful that she has all of the men in the film believing exactly what she wants them to believe and all of them believing that they ve actually got a chance with her and the men all slowly lose their head around her some of the men talk down to her but still they do what she says and she has all of them plotting against each other while lighting her cigarettes the film has been criticized for having an impossibly tangled plot but i think the point of the film is that you are never supposed to be certain or not whether elsa is merely defending herself against the men who want to control her or if elsa has been in control of all of them just like she has been in control of michael from the start even at the end we still want to believe that elsa is a victim of something perhaps something from her past that she just can t escape but since we don t know what her past was we have no ultimate insight into what has been driving her all along nor for that matter do we have any insight into what originary crime or sin has been driving the men all along all we know is that the sexes and the races and the classes are at odds elsa remains an unknown all the way through and michael once ensnared must realize that he too is an unknown because under her influence he has been forced to act against what he perceived to be his own true nature the lady from shanghai offers some of the most stunning visuals of any film noir i know of the acapulco scenes are especially exciting as the danger and unpredictability of a foreign woman is made especially inviting and exciting in a foreign land in this film welles offers the ultimate noir vision of anxiously uncertain men and women attracted to each other but also repelled by what they find themselves attracted to and what they find themselves doing in the name of desire its a film noir and that means that the film follows certain recognizable conventions but it does more than simply follow those conventions it pushes those conventions as far as they have been pushed and explores the nature of those conventions in a more thorough way than any noir before or arguably since by the end of the film the characters have become lost in their own plots and no longer know who they are and this is conveyed brilliantly with welles use of masks mirrors in the celebrated and luridly twisted funhouse scene which feels a bit like the famous dali sequence in hitchcock s spellbound but is even more disorienting disconcerting spellbound was released in so it is possible even likely that welles had seen it and that it influenced his own film that was made in and released in in the extra featurette that follows the film we learn that welles himself painted much of the funhouse props and set there are a lot of bad noirs out there and these give the genre a bad name but the few good ones are among the best films ever made welles reputation would be greater if film noir were better understood and appreciated not as a genre that is as cheap as the dime novels that inspired it but a genre where cinema explores its own methods and techniques the great directors from lang von stroheim to welles hitchcock to godard chabrol and the other new wave auteurs have all been attracted to noir for this reason a brilliant film after this film which was a commerical flop welles didn t work in america for ten years and when he did return to america he made touch of evil another brilliant noir film touch of evil also failed to generate revenue and effectively ended welles career as a mainstream director even though he continued to make independently financed small pictures like othello macbeth the trial chimes at midnight 
audie murphy i think our most decorated war hero was type cast in action films namely low budget westerns he may have been a better actor than that if given the chance 
a great adaptation this was a great adaptation to the classic tale of jane eyre the actors were brilliantly well put together and you could feel their emotions towards each other and towards those around them rochester isn t quite as mean hard as you feel he is in the book but his other qualities make up for that jane eyre s character was quaint quite well composed and pulled it off really well one of the best jane eyre s to hit the screen 
i never get tired of watching it this movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy the cast is great ed walters tim robbins the garage mechanic falls in love at first sight of catherine meg ryan when she appears at his gas station with a failing car with her pretentious fiance james mooreland stephen fry ed decides to go ask her out and appears at her home and knocks on the door the door opens and there is albert einstein walter matthau youre albert einstien zank you and thus begins the plot to break up the engagment and bring ed and catherine together the subcharacters are great ! especially einstein s pals played by lou jacobi gene saks and joseph maher three of the greatest minds and together they can t change a light bulb all in all a great warm funny film ! matthau again has to mentioned as his performance was brilliant he should have been nominated imho you can t go wrong with this one 
the art of gore i ve seen a lot of really bloody disgusting sleazy icky and all round untidy films in my day and they ve worked and failed on every level what sets riki oh apart is its incredible originality with how far it s willing to take things over the top take a film like cabin fever which thinks that the very idea of sleaze is enough to drive a feature film we watch bored and annoyed as characters we don t care about rot and vomit blood on each other the misconception that blood is enough to drive a story made cabin fever the most unbearable filmgoing experience i ve ever had now take a film like riki oh which puts forth the effort to come up with new and inspired ways to torture its characters my personal favorite was the guy who tore out his own intestines to strangle our hero the assistant warden gleefully comments oscar you got a lot of guts like many chinese films it exists to expose the evils of capitalism it shows a dark vision of the future in which prisons are a privatize enterprise like parking lots the cells aren t locked and murder seems encouraged at one point you have to wonder if this is how our prison systems are actually perceived this might not be the smartest propaganda film in history but that s exactly what makes it so entertaining it pushes on relentlessly so involved in the filmmaking and violence that it never bothers to try to make it about anything else it s everything that a great exploitation film should be 
subversive comedy that probably won t appeal to the hoi polloi so what s wrong with this movie why are all of these people on amazon say it s boring or only worth seeing as a historical relic perhaps they are just feeling a bit left out these people will immediately recognize that this humor is not to their taste but you should take a look for yourself you may find that all of the flaws that others see are actually effective elements here exposition has been paired down to the minimum do you really want all of that exposition in your screwball comedy i d rather skip ahead to the larfs there are a lot of laughs everyone who likes this movie picks a different favorite moment i enjoy the absurdist tone of the scenes the intimidating social order is shown to be made up of individuals who don t so much support that order but just follow it our protagonist is just trying to help them to let it all hang out so there s my stuffy analysis but do you want to see it no what if i told you it had psychedelic train freak outraquel welch surrounded by topless womenproof that all asian people don t look the same to old white peoplethe most obnoxious car ever imagined years before its time how to talk your way out of a parking tickethow to cultivate an appreciation for the fine art 
objection your honor this is the first novel of john grisham and like the movie it s very strong in characters and dialogue at the time he wrote it there was some pretty good attempts at making good lawyer movies witness for the prosecution comes to mind and we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like parker crais lehane george and grafton but the legal mystery novel was uncharted land and grisham plowed it over with a passion how was grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given evil empire writers like len deighton and john lecarre fits eventually the public would tire at lawyers even laughing at them nevertheless it s a good book and also an excellent movie if there are drawbacks then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust the lawfirm itself for example sexual misconduct in a lawfirm sure misconduct in billing always stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains occasionally but murdering associates who try to leave i don t think so but it does give department of justice cop ed harris a great line in the movie mcdeere no one has left your firm alive ! the movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it the lovely jeanne tripplehorn the this time not very grandfatherly wilfred brimley holly hunter always a hoot gary busey hal holbrook and law and order s steven hill to mention a few and tom cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and abbey s rainbow has a hazmat sticker on it that he s overlooked cruise is just great a true hitchkockian character the average man with no where to run what would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom that s the firm stars larry scantlebur 
another incredible richard widmark performance i am such a big fan of richard widmark he s my favorite actor and so underappreciated wellat least in my opinion im thrilled this has finally been released on video because it s not only a landmark film it s a great one also of course we have the chance to see the brilliant debut of sidney poitier and he is very powerful but richard is just mesmerising playing a character so convincingly different from the way he really was the storyline has already been recapped by others suffice to say this is a slice of history that pulls no punches in tone and language of the racial tensions of s america i am sure as with the film pinky the studio took a risk with this release even if you are not a rabid fan of richard or sidney ! this film holds up over repeat viewings and so is worth having in your collection 
by far michael apted s masterpiece above the incandescent and vivid performance of sigourney weaver the primatologist whose overwhelming devotion to the once nearly extinct mountain gorillas of central africa led to her eventual murder the storytelling is ravishing and let the viewer with the absolute conviction she crossed the border line around the investigation and the self experience in many issues a magnificent and disturbing movie hard to forget in years a winner film ! 
another good csi ny though csi ny is most least favorite of the three csis they still manage to make a good one sometimes this is one of those good ones 
only interested in the performances i bought this because i wanted to watch the performances the rest was just gossip i was not disappointed in the performances they are great i can see why people got a little bit attached to this period in his career but if we all pay close attention each period in his career is special we get a chance to watch him communcate lovingly with his muse and their relationship always stirs the soul 
complex tangled is actually a really good movie you have to pay attention or you ll get lost in the plot but other than that it was a great movie 
funny sellers farce after the fox succeeds on so many levels it is equal bits caper film slapstick and filmmaking satire it also allows peter sellers fertile comic mind to run free as a master criminal masquerading as an italian neo realist filmmaker good supporting turns are given here by victor mature as a vain american movie star and martin balsam as mature s exasperated agent britt ekland sellers wife at the time is good as sellers incorrigible sister director vittorio de sica makes good use of the italian locales and peoples the film with authentic locals i was surprised that this film was scripted by neil simon because alot of his work is topheavy with verbal gags but this film is equally weighted with the visual and verbal jokes a wonderful entry in the peter sellers canon 
smart thriller this movie is well worth your money and time the leads redford and dunnaway have excellent chemistry the script is taut and well written the tension will keep you alert and focused on the movie and anxious to find out how the movie will end i highly recommend this film and if you enjoy smart thrillers you will too

trapped in the cube cube is a cult hit that basically means that it s good or innovative but not many people know about it vincenzo natali also creator of cypher and nothing made his full length directorial debut with this film a low budet innovative sci thriller that feels like an episode of the twilight zone as written by mark danielewski and franz kafka yes it s that surreal and that intelligent and well writtenseven people have been placed in a cubical room which is connected to a bizarre maze of thousands more among are a cop a disabled man an architect a student a doctor and a criminal and all of them have wildly disparate personalities but they soon learn that behind the countless doors there are deadly booby trapsso of course their chances of survival don t seem so good but they soon learn that their placement in the cube is no accident each one has skills that the group needs to escape they will have to band together and use their brains but why are they in the cube in the first place and is the maze even the same as when they started vincenzo natali s cube is a perfect example of what hollywood can t seem to grasp it doesn t matter how much money is poured into a movie because it s the concept brains and skill that make it good or bad not the special effects or the big names and natali did a magnificent job with his first full length movie infusing what seems to be a straightforward thriller with a taut claustrophobic atmosphere and some ominous hints about morality or the lack of it and sociology it also has an unusually intelligent script with prime numbers and their powers playing a big part right next to the gruesome deaths and of course the solid dialogue youve got a gift its not a gift it s just a brain at the heart of the creepiness natali only reveals the secrets of the cube as they are revealed to the characters which adds to the suspense what is this thing why are they in it we know as much as they do and we re only going to find out more about it when they do its also a movie that bothers to have real characters no screaming teens here the movie s plot depends on them being very different natali and andr bijelic reveal the characters through their action and dialogue some are whiny some are cruel and some are just annoying some of the acting is rather flat and a few of the arguments ring hollow but overall it s very like watching real people vincenzo natali s cube gives a good name to shoestring budgets and eerie plots definitely deserving of its cult status bizarre twisted and creepy 
i love johnny depp i love this movie ifs funny and i can t wait too see number three 
red hot romance here is a tale about two young teenagers who are stranded on an island somewhere and eventually fall in love the stars brooke shields and christopher atkins were teenagers when this film was made this film was another hit for director randal kleiser who scored big with the paramount musical grease subsequently kleiser directed honey i blew up the kid which was a sequel to honey i shrunk the kids the sequel to this film return to the blue lagoon was a box office disappointment in the summer of when this film was theatrically released other hit movies from then include urban cowboy and the blues brothers shields since this film appeared in many print ads and made a lot of television appearances which includes a starring role on the sitcom suddenly susan 
i thought run lola run would never have any competition boy ! was i wrong spun is an absolute pleasure to watch it doesn t wait around to get noticed instead it sets it s own pace like for example no credits roll in the beginning no apologetic character introductions there is no stop sign in this film everything is unhooked and raw yet nothing seems to be out of place the direction is bizzare camerawork is staggering at places the sets are like gutters the music is extraordinarily amusing and the acting is another level there are many characters in the film and a quite a wide variety too the reason i compare spun with run lola run is because it was nearly as entertaining as the german wonderflick was spun is possibly one of a kind i enjoyed it more than i enjoyed trainspotting now that is saying a lot unfortunately i haven t seen many movies like spun in hollywood so i have no recommendations this is an absolute must watch if there ever was one 
wonderful love story i thoroughly enjoyed fire i found it to be a lovely story of love and desire both actresses did a fine job in their roles you will like this story and the ending is better than i thought it was going to be 
romaticaly gothic i have been a fan of vamp movies for a long time books movies at any other type of media this movie was a very romantic type of gothic film sure the actors may have been better but what the heck i have seen far worse than this one i myself found it a pleasure to watch and was hoping for a second installment into this sad vamp life 
pixar creates a classic truly a family movie that we enjoy today as much as we did when it was first released the only thing i think they should have changed is when the mother all of the fish eggs except nemo get eaten by the scary fish they could have come up with something different it still doesn t sit well with my almost three yr old my almost yr old they see it as nemos mommy brother sisters it s hard to explain to them why a bad fish ate nemos mommy good grief they could have gone with a less severe story line other than that it is a wonderful movie in which i think dory voiced by ellen degeneres steals the show it will be a classic enjoyed for many years to come 
the book is better the movie is still good pretty hard to take a well written book by the likes of john grisham and bring it all onto the screen they do a pretty good job matt damon plays rudy a student in law school who s smart broke and about to make history in the meantime his partner and him are working hard on a case against a scamming life insurance company that never paid out to a boy who had cancer the policy covered it but they would just not pay meantime damons character is in deeper than ever as he falls for an abused woman whose redneck husband will soon find out read the novel then watch the movie it s really a very moving story and the characters in the book and movie are alive and thriving danny devito plays damons partner in the film and it s one of the better roles i ve seen him play 
improved lolita incomplete psyche seven stages of an affair an alliance of convenience between a rich man and a needy young girl is explored through all its phases and taken to its final conclusion decades later if you have an interest in this subject you will like the movie and see it as deep and profound otherwise it will seem shallow and bore you because of the incompletely developed side plots there are many side plots sexual awakening of a young girl mentioned in other reviews seems to be a side plot though fairly well developed chemistry between adolescent girls the jealousy and competition among siblings these are introduced but left frustratingly undeveloped it would have made the movie too long it works out much better than lolita where the girl dies and the man is jailed for murder but not as well as psyche where through the diligence of her magical helpers and the deviousness of venus there is a complete conversion from secret mistress to immortal wife the oldest and most famous in literature the difference i believe is in the respect the older lover shows for the girl and her family even though they don t deserve it this redeems his character as compared to lolita s blundering lover who covers up his mistakes and takes no responsibility for outcomes but though responsible in the present this lover takes no responsibility for the future unlike cupid who insists on charging against fate and tradition though sensibly so and only after he has tested his companion the young girl also takes responsibility entering the relationship with deliberate awareness the whole film novel is in fact an exercise lesson in self awareness but she is incomplete compared to psyche who allows herself to feel deeply enough to be moved while movement still matters by comparison the story also shows the role of circumstance in psyche s story cupid s mother wittingly or unwittingly a subject for debate plays an important role in putting the couple together in the lover his mother has died but her strong memory as evidenced by the sad state of his father sets the stage for love in lolita the man s mother is absent altogether and so is his respect for his partner or her family or any sense of personal responsibility what follows is somewhat of a spoiler i believe the movie shows the seven stages of an affair infatuation lust love rape impotence longing and reunion by omission it shows what an affair is not it is not the long term building of a family had the girl become pregnant as psyche did what would have happened it seems likely that in real life this would have happened and then real choices would have to be made 
great movie i saw this movie eons ago as a child and never forgot it i only remembered bits and pieces of the film i searched amazon com for months to find it but couldn t then suddenly there it was ! esther and the king ! i purchased it at once the film was just as i remembered the only problem with the dvd is the audio you cannot hear the dialogue clearly and with no subtitles it s hard to pick up what s going on i hope they can re release it with a better audio track 
great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch 
the gnome mobile this was purchased as a gift for my mother she had an old copy on vhs that had started to corrode now she can watch it as often as she wants and not have to worry about wearing out the copy 
i passed it on to my minister for reading it defined for me what we christians are struggling against secularism and pluarlism christians don t know they are like the frog in the tepid water that is heating up with secular thinking to the point of crucifying christ again and we are like the crowd in jerusalem that was apathetic scientific thinking has created morality and expunged the law of god as the final truth rz states this very clearly but doesn t give us enough push to act on the knowledge hopefully my minister will push the facts to our congregation so they know why they need to be delivered from evil 
wonderful film ! really a star our household consisting of two forty year old parents a fourteen year old girl and a seven year old girl loves this film i think it s because the film does a good job of depicting family relationships how do explain the odd relative to ousiders as well as exploring the issues revolving around the faith and truth of another s experience that is without proof or logic this film isn t for everyone it s a quiet rather pedestrian and very sweet film so if you are looking for a lot of razz matazz this film isn t for you however after viewing this film a couple of times my fourteen year old asks why don t they make films like this anymore josephine hill and james stewart are wonderful in this film hollywood at it s sleepy best 
can i have a turn on top paraphrasing this is what our hero asked the devil and what the devil asked god and what got him into this mess too many good moments to miss this is a nearly perfect movie its never mentioned in the recap of stanley donen s work but it should be sadly no commentary but the extras described on the dvd seem to be well worth it excuse me now as i am going to contribute to the fund for depraved criminals in memory of the great artists who made this joyful film 
the subtlety and greatness of mrs miniver when i watch this film i feel like i am in britain during those dramatic months when the raf was fighting daily to ward off the brain washed german barbarians and the world was hanging by a thread helmut dantin shouts in german like hitler at one point we will destroy everything ! though it won the academy award in it was in fact made in and it is about events in when britain stood alone a never tobeforgetten moment in human history people more objective than i will call it propaganda i call it a dramatic portrayal of the essence of a historial moment willie wilder manages to create on a hollywood studio lot the atmosphere of village in southern england near portsmouth perhaps the flower show scene is superbly done a wonderful madrigal choir sings a classical english folk song it is a very english moment wilder s got the train as they were then right and the station as well as the enlish church with its private pews for the gentry he even manages to get english accents out of everyone except walter pidgeon ney who plays miniver s son in real life about to marry his mother and little christopher severn her other son are straight up and down americans but they pull off the accent perfectly dame may whittey gives the sense of quality and breeding that was then a part of english character wilder touches affectionately upon english class obsessions their former love of and excellence at gardening the cockiness and the fashionable pseudo radicalism of young oxbridge graduates the understated physical bravery of the english people it s a brilliant job of director and a fabulous piece of revenge on wilder s part for hitler s antisemitism of which he was a victim mrs miniver is more than a film it is part of history it communicates the indominable spirit of the english people ney who plays miniver s son is a subtle combination of youth and very purposeful strength he giggles and cackles like a boy in front of his parents and siblings but when he gets the girl alone he knows what he wants and you recognize that he is very much a man you realize also that in a spitfire dogfight with the germans over england he will win there are many angles to this film that warrant watching it a number of times mrs miniver did a lot to bring world opinion around to britain s side and in that it is unique in hollywood history as film of historical importane 
both movies worth the individual price first of all sherlock jr is a classic even if you ve never heard of it you know of it it s the famous movie where keaton plays a projectionist who falls asleep during the movie and dreams about entering the frames now whether you re an arthouse fanatic a comedy geek or someone who just likes to be entertained this movie is perfect for you it contains nothing that makes it seem pretentious and yet its brilliance is so readily apparent it s understood by anybody this is certainly a film for everyone any era any age our hospitality isn t nearly as great but it s still wonderful the ending scenes with the waterfall are bound to make anyone gasp out loud and the movie as a whole hurts you with laughter definitely a good movie and definitely worth the price put them together on one dvd and it s basically a good deal even if it wasn t only about only if you re one of those people who gets really obsessive about the formatting of the dvd beware that the interactive menues are a bit odd nothing to get frustrated over just odd polarisdi 
perfect the best dvd that i ever saw perfect to make a party and play this dvd and everyone is gonna like your party 
it came from outer space i like the story line of this movie but most of all i remember watching it when i was a kid of seven it was scary back then even with limited special effects and no graphic details watching it now was very enjoyable i found myself going back in time this film is in its own right a science fiction classic 
a memory of years comes to life i first saw this film when i was thirteen perhaps even younger as i recall seeing it in black and white thirty years on propelled by memories which still stuck in my mind i bought this disk from america it is not released in the uk where i live seeing again through adult eyes one notices the joins the songs which do not really work the occasional twee touch but what a film ! presented in marvellous technicolour with a cast which takes the script seriously and does not go over the top unnecessarily thus bringing dr seuss s amazing freudian dreamfantasy to life this is not an epic it is an intimate film which talks to you rather than throwing endless special effects at you to stave off your boredom its also nothing like the recent live action the cat in the hat which some consider the worst film ever it reminds us of the gulf between adults and children and dr seuss reminds us that sometimes adults have to see through children s eyes to see the truth but it also lets the adults have their say as well this is ultimately a film of its time the early s but it s a film which takes its chances and doesn t play safe it s a film which is strange dreamlike and worth taking to your heart thirty years on i m glad i did why not try it you might too 
highly recommended this movie has everything we expect in a jackie chan flick including plenty of bad guys for jackie to fight some are clearly great martial artists themselves not just actors as mentioned by other reviewers pretty girls that jackie must save death defying stunts chase scenes guns explosions and plenty of humor two thumbs up ! regarding the dvd format the one i saw in store had widescreen on one side and full screen on the other i own it on vhs myself and am considering upgrading to the dvd some of you parents might also like to know this one has no nudity 
i m surprised it hasn t melted in the dvd player last count was i believe or anyway the kids are officially gooby goobers 
fab mostly universal released the title in summer and returns with a collectors edition at the same price the main upgrades are dolby audio and an audio interview with astrid kirchherr the german photographer who took the beatles first publicity shots the anamorphic widescreen images seem about the same as on the disc good but sometimes grainy other extras duped from the old dvd include a director s commentary a pair of deleted scenes and various interviews that tend to repeat material packaging is a lot classier than on the old dvd backbeat takes the time to let its bogus beatles perform entire numbers mostly soul covers the real music came from a grunge supergroup put together for the film by producer don was the new audio sounds sensational with a vibrant and musical surround stage director iain softley kpax tells how he spent six years researching and writing the project inspired by stylish photos he saw of kirchherr and her lover stu sutcliffe the beatles first bass player the backbeat script was based on her recollections it focuses on the couple and jealous guy john lennon this might not be a beatles film but there s an undeniable thrill when late in the story the paul mccartney character switches to his trademark german bass and the fabled front three wails on please mr postman the film s downer ending gets drowned out by the joys of twist and shout and the promise of beatlemania 
great for kids i am an elementary music teacher and bought this to show my students all of the students loved it from k the narration makes it easier to understand and keeps the interest 
i have enough stories i want a life days starring sandra bullock she was courageous to take such a challenging role like this she plays an alcoholic who is placed in a rehab center for well you guessed it days i think bullock is at her best when she does drama i love her comdies as well but she expands her talent and growth as an actress in dramatic roles this film does have funny moments from time to time but it is mainly a hard hitting drama the scene where bullock is in the withdrawal period of her addiction is real and heartbreaking she is and probably will never be recognized as a gifted performer she should have been nominated for an award like the golden globes or something days is quirky spunky and cute just like sandy 
movie review for sherlock jr sherlock jr is fabulously inventive and exellently crafted considering when it was made middle s it has marvelous special effects i found it immensely entertaining great buster keaton ! our hospitality is good funny in many places but tends to be a bit long for the plotline that is it drags a bit in the middle the scene near the end in the river and the rescue are however vintage buster keaton 
an immeasurably uplifting story i ve always been inclined to see motivational movies patch adams the big fish good will hunting etc but this just went over my expectations a jewel now one of my favorites i m happy to its addition to my collection of films thanks to liz murray for sharing her life with us 
ingmar bergman s magic flute magic indeed this is another dvd i ve been looking for there are many versions of mozart s magic flute and this is the one for me i saw it years ago perhaps when it came out in the theatre and it stuck with me it s wonderful on many levels full of humor passion color emotion and of course wonderful singing in lovely swedish with optional english subtitles 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
very moving and thankfully somewhat dated this film is a wonder for many reasons beautiful performances sharp writing and directing and sad when i first saw this the sobbing in the theater was so intense that i thought i d have to build an ark to get home now longtime companion is still all of those things but a little dated advances in medicine haved moved us to a point where aids is not an immediate death sentence watching this film years later it does play a bit like and then there were none but it still works watch it and remember if you lived through that era watch it and be greatful if you did not 
a real treasure i ordered this dvd when it first came out and i ve been enjoying it ever since all the performances are enjoyable some more than others but they are all wonderful nonetheless some of my pesonal favorites include patti lupone bringing down the house along with mandy patinkin and bob gunton doing the song a new argentina from evita this is definately one of my top favorites on this dvd anegela lansbury providing a hilarious performance in the worst pies in london from sweeny todd the demon barber of fleet streetcarol channing singing the nothing lessthan inspirational before the parade passes by from hello dolly yul brynner performing shall we dance with his co star not sure of her name this performance is priceless and so is that dress john raitt s beautiful baritone voice soars in this song hey there from the pajama gamepaul lynde delivers a ton of laughs in kids from bye bye birdiejoel grey and cast perform the spectacle that is cabaret in the song willkommen this song never gets out of your head gwen verdon and chita rivera two of broadway s top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from chicago all that jazz and nowadays bob fosse s coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment jerry orbach his death was a tragic loss to the theater that s why these dvd s are so remarkable this is another top performance the song lullaby of broadway from nd street it was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to nyc to see my very first broadway show nd street andrea mcardle and the orphans perform tomorrow and youre never fully dressed without a smile from annie this is just superb there s absolutely no flaws betty buckley and cast perform two songs from cats jellicle songs and the classic memory it is stunning to watch any performance with patti lupone in it is a gem in itself this one buenos aires from evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of eva peron bonnie franklin and cast are hilarious in the song applause from the show applause the whole theme to the song is true and kind of hits home for every actor plus it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you re a big fan of musicals all in all this dvd is totally worth buying ! and after you re through with this one and have memorized all the songs check out broadway s lost treasures ii i have yet to receive iii but i am looking forward to it ! 
the best movie of all time this movie has it all especially for baby boomers of the early s blethyn as a betrayed widow is priceless and nigel ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks the english scenery is charming and blethyn s loyal village friends top off the movie s touching humor and happy ending i have given this dvd as christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too a must own 
this film begs a question with all of usual aforementioned accolades here i saw the film as part of the university film series as a deaf individual from germany i felt lot of empathy here associating with the issues of defining the deafness medical intervention respect for the deaf community and identity and so forth at some points in the film a pressing matter bothered me so much i wonder why the parents and their parents didn t receive the counselling to deal with their emotional ramification of the deafness as well as their profound and deliberating insecurity assocating with the deafness the film illustrated the glaring omission amongst the families so well that the counselling was no brainerthe hearing mother of deaf parents seemed to be so utterly devastated and in grave turmoil upon hearing a sound clip of how a deaf child might hear with hearing aid her shockandawe facial expression and trembling body language were more suited for death of a child rather than over the deafness upon the first response of their deaf son to the sound after the surgery her hearing husband reacted as if he had been given a not guilty verdict the hearing parents of deaf son pestered and nagged on and on about their wishes for their deaf grandchildren to function as hearing ersatz conspiring the family members against each other that poor deaf girl was more confused about her identity and her place in the society if she could choose the phrase from shakespeare it would be alas woe is me and to be deaf or not to be deaf that is question the most tragic part was that little girl with cochlear implant when the deaf family visited her to learn about the cochlear implant the girl was perceived as a medical curosity rather than as an individual she sat there the whole time presenting her implanted device whilst her mother desribed the procedure discussed about the device and like it is same for the classes that the deaf parents and their deaf daughter visited in the class where the oralism speaking and lipreading along with hearing aids or cochlear implants was a de regueur method the children seemed lifeless and lacked the energy of typical children in the deaf class the children were burst with energy and engaging the bottom line is that the film compels the need for counselling for the families affected by the deafness we have so many resources where the parents can draw from our experience and learn what work and whatnot some states in the usa have laws requiring the collaboration between the parents of deaf children and state agency or programme that collaboration specialises in providing the unbiased resources and supports as to ensure their success in raising the deaf child to lead the autonomous and fulfilling lives that sort of collaboration works well in denmark and other scandinavian countries as well as in usa fda certifies the cochlear implant as elective surgery in same category as breast augmentation rhinoplasy etc in other word the deafness is neither a life threatening condition nor a detrimental condition affecting the quality of life we have so many choices of medical devices to support our participation in the greater society for instance the people can choose wheelchair electric wheelchair crutches arm crutches walkers canes and like to support their mobility cochlear implant does not correct the deafness like the eyeglasses or contact lenses can it is also fraught with so many contradictions and tragic outcome i have seen it too often to wonder whether the cochlear implant is even legal procedure or a proper medical device oftentimes the parents were misled to think the cochlear implant is the answer to the deafness when in fact many well proven methods work much better for the deaf in long run 
throne of blood i was enormously fascinated by the film the throne of blood we just watched as part of our pre ap english course in nagoya international school japan the film adopts the plot of shakespeare s macbeth with a japanese setting macbeth is characterized as a japanese warrior the head of the st fort after the victory he sees a spirit the witch equivalent in the forest on his way to the shogun s castle as he has predicted he was awarded the prestigious status of the head of the castle the king decided to visit his castle one day to organize a plan to kill the banquo equivalent character he is extremely proud of the trust that the king has in order to arrange such an important event but his wife believes that the king insists on killing him instead the big gap between his optimism and his wife s pessimism leads him to the road of tragedy i believe the director of the film could easily adopt the setting very similar to that of the original macbeth thanks to the similarities in the feudal system of japan and scotland japan also believed in the existence of spirits and how the nobleman was ranked in status was similar to that of scotland kurosawa would ve struggled creating the throne of blood if he for example adopted dynastic china or the kingdom of thailand as the scene instead of japan all of the characters in the throne of blood successfully and accurately emulated the characters in the shakespearean version although there were some changes in their persona such as the lady macbeth character was a more modest figure than the original all characters kept their qualities tendencies and their role to people whom read macbeth in the past this movie is definitely worth the watch viewers can receive the same impression and the excitement of macbeth with a totally different setting koy 
perfect film for the entire family one of the first signs of civilization in the old west was the arrival of the fred harvey restaurant this is the hollywood version of the opening of one of these rest stops judy garland plays susan she answered a lonely hearts ad and is coming out to marry him but when she arrives it turns out that its gruff cowhand chill wills she joins the harvey girls john hodiak is ned the proprietor of the alhambra saloon while he runs the saloon he is a straight shooter if he can t beat the harvey house fair and square then he ll move on of course judy and john battle but in the end fall for each other others include angela lansbury as the head saloon girl who is in love with ned ray bolger as the new blacksmith straight from massachusetts virginia o brien as on of the harvey girls who falls for bolger marjorie main as the harvey cook this is a piece of fluff like most of the mgm musicals by the arthur freed unit but it has a great score by johnny mercer and harry warren including the oscar winner on the atchison topeka and the santa fe this number is one of the best staged musical numbers of the s but the best scene is when the meat is stolen from the harvey house and judy grabs a couple of pistols and charges over to the alhambra to retrieve it judy is perfect in the role and there is chemistry between her and hodiak the supporting cast is perfect virginia o briens trademark dead pan deliver has never been put to better use this film use to be played every easter weekend and i always looked forward to this thirty years later it still holds up perfectly dvd extras cast and crew list this is just a list and does not give any background on the actors or crew it would be interesting to know what happened to hodiak this is his only major starring role deleted musical numbers a duet between garland and hodiak my intuition that was cut for time production number and reprise march of the doagies not used due to rewrites the reprise is the master shot only both are good numbers stereo reproduction for on the atchison topeka and the santa fe the original multi track recording survived and a stereo reproduction was created this is fine but the musical number is the first real number of the movie commentary by george sidney i never listen to these and therefore cannot evaluate singsong express audio track additional recording of some of the song audio only 
as relevant today as ever what is at stake here is the kind of government that we people want to give ourselves it s been the same choice since the end of the roman republic here we have two factions both are excellent demagogues both play on the mobs appetites and weaknesses the heart of the film or play is the speeches of brutus the conservative and of antony the liberal the interesting thing for the viewer is that we are at the same time part of the mob who listens intently while at the side of caesar s corpse and have the extraordinary advantage of witnessing from closer range the hidden expressions in antony s face his true thoughts and intentions so we are able to distinguish two facts about both orators that will help us balance our vote on one or the other candidates and these things are first brutus is honest towards his party and to the people you may agree or disagree actually the mob agrees with him concerning the necessary death of the ambitious caesar but he is an honest man and so antony in a side admits that he is honest the second thing we discover is that antony is a deceiver a deceiver towards brutus by not fulfilling his word of honor and arousing the populace against brutus and a demagogue towards the mob it always ends the same way the demagogues wins the day sounds familiar i remember when years ago in per the foreign candidate fujimori won the election against vargas llosa the famous writer fujimori stole all the money he laid his eyes on and when he was found out he left for japan and solicited and obtained assylum thanks to his japannese origin it is true that in this film both parties are corrupt and only look after their own greedy interests but some times an honorable man shows up and begs cries out for a chance this is the story of brutus the honorable man of all times not that i loved caesar lessbut that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die as slaves who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended the only perfect kingdom is the one our lord will bring in his second coming amen the stars are because in the second part of the film the interest decreases notably 
beautiful movie mccabe mrs miller is often talked about as one in a list of director robert altman s seventies films that takes on a cinematic genre namely the western and subverts it to the point of making it seem like an attack on its cinematic precedents the traditional western s gung ho heroism is nowhere in evidence and it seems mccabe is a mere parody of a hero that director invites the audience to laugh at if this was the case than mccabe and mrs miller would at best be looked upon as a satirical look back at cinematic tastes of the fifties a self congratulatory how far we ve come negation of the western s romance in favour of a neo realist version of the west populated with a cast of ambiguous charaters that are anything but heroic if altman s the long goodbye transported the hopelessly out ofdate phillip marlowe into the californian seventies than mccabe and mrs miller inverts this and transposes the typically indecisive modern man californian or otherwise into the context of the mythical west but this is to do both mccabe and mrs miller and it s western precedents a disservice the film works best not as a suberversion of a genre which in the end is just satire but as a subervsion or more correctly deconstruction of myth regardless of individual and singular genre which is much grander if elements of subverting the western seem implicit in this than it is true to the point of having pre conceived notions of the archetypal western hero and that would be ignoring the moral complexities of john wayne s character in the searchers or william holden in the wild bunch to name a couple at the outset we are presented with the figure of mccabe newly entered into presbyterian church society brash intent on playing cards and buying rounds the impression of bravura western confidence we have is solidified by the circulating rumour of his killing a man in days gone by skip to the film s end and our initial impressions have been justified the myth has been confirmed and has flourished and is ready to continue it is in the movie s middle acts where the myth is subverted warren beatty is exceptional as the indecisive businessman whose assertiveness is whittled away by the scene not in any western since johnny guitar has a female taken such an authoritive role as julie christy here she is decidedly the dominant partner in both their business and their relationship decidedly this is subversion but it is the film s focus of the business and the relationships which ultimately makes it more when it comes to the point where another character asserts that mccabe has never killed a man the audience is in accord yet the myth comes to be it is all the stronger and more romantic for its being rooted in the work aday realities in this it is as much a comment on art as it is on the western and has little to do with ultra realism there is myth of its own in the making of the myth and altman and vilmos zsigmond s stunning cinematography realize this beautifully here mccabe mrs miller is one of the great films of the seventies and a personal favorite 
blue gene gene hackman s electrifying performance dominates this adaptation of john grisham s best selling novel hackman portrays sam cayhall a man who s been on death row for sixteen years for the bombing of a lawyer s office that resulted in the death of the lawyer s two children cayhall is a vile man who has lived a life of hatred and prejudice the result of generations of such bigoted ancestors enter chris o donnell as his young grandson who is a lawyer and wants to reopen the case and spare his grandfather the gas chamber what ensues is a painful exploration of hatred prejudice and a dysfunctional family i liked the movie in spite of its several flaws hackman is phenomenal and chris o donnell does a good job as the naively innocent but determined young barrister faye dunaway offers wonderful support as hackman s estranged daughter who has lived a life of secrecy and guilt lela rochon raymond barry david marshall grant and robert prosky offer fine support too i found myself involved in the movie and feel it didn t offer any easy answers hackman is a guilty man but his performance is so well doone that one can t help but feel sorry for the life he has chosen and the life he has sacrificed i think it s well worth viewing 
unique and enthralling from the start i blatantly refuse to compare this film to huston s moulin rouge these are two distinctly seperate works and though their subject might be the same it would be a disservice to the merits of both to place them on the same page that having been said from the great storyline to the rip roaring dance finale this is one heck of a movie musical far far too obscure at least in this country i ve told innumerable friends about it always with the same result they tell me they ve never heard of it well now that you have it s very well worth your time to check it out firstly the character development is fantastic jean gabin shines as the impresario danglard francoise arnould is wonderful as his ingenue inspiration nini and maria felix is devastating as the diva la belle abesse as well look for the glittering talents that surround the peripheral characters are a delight to behold and of course the great edith piaf makes a brief appearance as well another quality i love about this film is the relatively accurate depiction of s paris the costumes colors and attitudes are well captured the truth of the casting couch is openly mentioned and relationships between performers and impresario are depicted with often saddening accuracy on a lighter note the dances are captured beautifully as well throughout the film they shine in rehearsal rooms dingy bars and of course in the aforementioned finale overall this is a most enjoyable film and unlike many golden age hollywood musicals it doesnt shy away from the ugly truths of life in the theatre well worth a viewing and very well worth purchase 
did they get revenge on the wrong guy maybe i have this wrong i ll have to review the footage but in the final scene at the night club did they get the wrong guy did anyone else notice this i think i saw the actual rapist standing and watching the events unfold with a smirk on his face at least i think it was him that would be the ultimate irony in this disturbing but amazing film 
awesome movie this movie has affectionately received the title of the lysol movie in my house because it has eliminated of unnecessary garbage movies are filled with today the swearing is at a low less than ten times in the whole movie i think is what i counted and there is absolutely no inappropriate jokes clothing or anything this is definitely a breath of fresh air ! almost every movie is being polluted lately and for my christian family this movie is so welcomed the story line is ingenious far fetched sure but so is pirates and everyone loves that i am in no way comparing the two movies pirates is completely different but they do both have storylines based on something real that has been exaggerated it is pretty historically correct benjamin franklin really did write silence dogood letters and the clock tower on the dollar bill really does say nicholas cage does a fantastic job portraying ben and riley is just hilarious no matter how many times i ve seen this movie he always cracks me up this is the best action movie made lately because everyone can watch it the little kids don t have to leave at certain parts sure it s not perfect but that s why i call it the lysol movie 
clever comment on reaganism set in a galaxy of post transformational liberalism just kidding i don t know what i m talking about you should see this movie if you like sex nudity hot babes mickey rourke carre otis mickey rourke and carre otis going at it for real perfume commercials directors trying to make their softcore porn look like art by filming everything sensually and in slow motion so the film appears to be arthouse and visually stimulating really really really bad dialogue lots of good banging and screwing without a plot mickey rourke playing a total pimp which is different than just mickey rourke i mean there s mickey rourke and then there s mickey rourke the pimp which is even cooler and finally hot female characters who wear glasses and carry around clipboards so the audience believes they are smart and successful businesswomen when in fact they d have a hard time calculating also see alone in the dark tara reid s character or fantastic four jessica alba s highly recommended to the appropriate demographic i could kill myself for buying it 
wonderful when i saw the plot description i wasn t sure i wanted to see this movie but the reviews convinced me to give it a try am i glad i did ! i laughed so much i did something i ve never done before watched it again the next day and i laughed even harder the second time around okay so this isn t your action packed thriller and the plot is well for the dogs but you re laughing so hard you hardly notice granted the characters are more caricatures than people but the caricatures ring true we ve seen those faces on our friends our co workers and in our weaker moments on ourselves get your friends to watch it and soon you ll be comparing your favorite lines and laughing all over again mine that handler looks familiar 
wow in hell is one of the best jcvd movies from his recent direct to video offerings in the film he plays kyle leblanc a french american man living and working in russia with his american wife who soon gets brutally murdered kyle is then sent to a russian prison after he murders the man who killed his wife of course this prison is no cakewalk actually it makes oswald state prison from the hbo show oz literally look like disney world the warden and guards are all corrupt and the prisoners who have money get all the perks the warden also sets up a human cockfighting arena on the prison grounds where he has two prisoners fight most of the time fight to the death and he and his friends take bets on the winners of course jcvd sets out to make his way through this corrupt system help his new prison friends and get revenge for his wife s death the film is very dark brutal and bloody but it is beautifully filmed there is one scene in particular when kyle is thrown in the hole for misbehaving in that scene after kyle loses hope and tries to hang himself a moth flies down from the window rafters above him and the camera beautifully follows it down as it flutters toward kyle and then it lands on the handle of the spoon that is in his untouched bowl of gruel as if to say eat get stronger and you will be able to free yourself from this place i know it sounds really corny but it is really a lovely scene and not something that you typically see in jcvd films the dvd transfer is awesome picture and sound quality are good and you get widescreen and fullscreen to choose from definitely a movie to see whether you like van damme or not it s a movie for anyone who has ever lost anyone they loved or had their life inexplicably turned upside down and had to fight to get things right

this movie is for everyone not just children it s a story about not being afraid i think my parents got it for me because i have a chronic lung condition known as cystic fibrosis and they wanted to encourage the idea of being brave or it was just because my dad was big into drugs and he wanted me to watch one of the coolest psychedelic films around this movie totally rocks either way 
is this the austrailian sound i want the austrailian sound first of all i highly recommend the review below by the guy named sideburns i think he captures the factual basis and spirit for this film i can understand how some who are australiaphiles might want to see a purely aussie product and this is not that it s not smash palace or many other fine aussie films of that genre what this film is can be described in one word weird thats a good thing the genius of eric roberts used to be and may still be again his ability to seemingly lose himself in his roles and do so while lacking any self consciousness about how he comes across to see this film and then see other excellent and weird films including the pope of greenwich village and runaway train is to see a career arc that was pretty amazing he seemed to get into serious films with major talent around him and then be able to carry off demanding roles albeit some similar sure with energy and command okay onto this film first of all let s be honest this is not a deep film it s not meant to be it is almost like an indie verson of a farrely brothers film at least their early ones where they don t mind taking risks and also having fun there s also a nice romantic subtext they had kingpin believe it or not me myself irene where in a ridiculous way they reflect what s in a good majority of people who are either searching for love or just searching for something in themselves and they find it reflected or in the case of the main characters in the farrely films and definitely in coca cola kid abbetted by others i m not saying woody harrelson or jim carrey could ve been the coca cola kid but what they all have in common in the specific roles they played in these films is to make one wonder if anyone would or could find anything remotely interesting about them in a romantic way they are so completely un indearing it seems almost cartoonish and then one just thinks of many people we all know and it s not that unbelieavable the music in the film alone is just fantastic the coca cola jingle robert s character commissions is incredible and it s punctuated by this aboriginal guy who is playing his device a guy roberts finds outside the coca cola local offices and promptly drafts into service it s just really funny to see the kid s mind work marketing wheels a spinnin as he devises and employs his strategies everyone on both sides is equally mocked and that makes for a really fine mostly non judgemental film rare these days eh there are other nice touches in the soundtrack andalso i d be remiss not to mention nuts if i avoided the very nice scene of greta scaatchi where she s freshening up well go see the film its quirky it s revealing and a lot of fun it also does a great job of discussing culture clashes where when everyone is harmless you can see how progress comes out of a some dissension yet still wonder if we re losing a little something in the translation if that s vague so s the film in some ways and i think that is precisely what the director was going for it doesn t all have to fit perfectly a lot doesn t and that makes it kind of seem real 
one of the best submarine truestories features russian heroes in a nutshell underrated undervalued underexposed excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event ! it is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box officeharrison ford and liam neeson are ideally suited as soviet naval captains and as believable as their rebuilt authentic k kathryn bigelow who directed and produced the film did an incredible job which can be better appreciated by viewing the excellent featurettes that are included on the dvd bottom line this new kind of sub film is a part of historyif you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best if you enjoy thrillers this film delivers enough edge ofyourseat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine movie and thriller enthusiast in anyone 
here doggie doggie i enjoyed bad moon simply because it was one of those horror flicks that was not afraid to show the monster for any length of time even the howling didn t give us any long looks at the werewolves 
mein gott i love this movie okay it has to be the most vulgar movie i have ever watched in my entire life but i love this movie i kept thinking only the coen brothers could pull this off before i discovered that they had only produced it ! this movie works despite its vulgarity which i will return to later this movie works because of the kid what a sweetheart ! such patience such love such faith he actually touches the black heart and washes it whiter than snow this is one of the few believable conversion movies because the plot is not contrivedbut grows out of the nature and action of the protagonists my only problem with it is the vulgarity see as i was watching it i sooo wanted to share it with my year old because it was very very funny guntoting elves drunk crude santa a child who acts like a child the three b s and the message was actually an important and well illustrated one that good wills out but because of the over thetop language and the three b s you know what i m talking about i dared not this is the grinch this is scrooge this is the three godfathers all works wherein the black heart is touched by purity and transformed but so much more honestly presented i think they could have done without the vulgarity and gotten the same message across in fact i wish they had done without it 
never grow up what a good movie after having to call it quits due to a shoulder injury coach jim morris took another approach to baseball coaching after taking over a high school team in texas he made a promise to them he told them that of they won districts he would try out for a big league team after the districts were won that only left coach morris with one thing to do try out for the majors ! 
better than a cup of coffee i really enjoyed this video i am very sluggish in the mornings and don t really have the time for a full workout because of my hectic schedule what was so appealing to me about this video was that there was a short segment for each morning that i could find time to complete before rushing out the door it gives me the extra pick up that i need before a long day at work also i really liked the fact that i didn t need to rewind the tape after i was finished with my segment for the day i thought the concept behind the video was very clever and perfect for my lifestyle thanks ann 
i ws never this emotional i loved the movie not only because julia was present but because of the way she ended up falling for the ill guy not everybody these dayswould have done that but it just showed how love evolves in different places of our lives i cried for the most part alone of course

watching paint dry can watching paint dry be riveting interesting and compelling can looking at a beautiful woman who is naked for almost three of four hours long movie be not erotic is it possible to watch the movie where an artist creates sketch after sketch of his model in preparation for a painting and many scenes run in real time and not become bored but instead be totally absorbed by the painter on the screen and how he was progressing with his work jacques rivette s le belle noiseuse is certainly not for every taste but i found it immensely rewarding it is one of very few films where creative process with all its tension uncertainty selfishness and self centering of an artist who once he began working is nearly oblivious not only to his model s discomfort but to the feelings of the ones close to him have been shown on the screen with such truthful passion technical excellence and tremendous acting michel piccoli as an aging painter edouard frenhofer once famous and productive jane birkin liz his much younger wife and a former favorite model and emmanuelle bart as marianne the young bright and intensely intelligent woman whose presence awakened frenhofer from semi lethargy and made him want to paint again were unforgettable the film also explores a vital for any artist subject what is more important the process of creating a work of art or the result 
long tall dexter dexter gordon is dale turner an ex patriot jazz musician living in paris and playing nightly at the blue note his character is based loosely on lester young and bud powell but mainly it is all dexter a young frenchman francois cluzet idolizes him and later befriends him dex has problems mainly booze and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink the cliche of the self tortured jazz musician who s got to find something new to say on his horn every night is of course the main focus of the film that this is the only way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform but it sells dex gets homesick for new york returns falls into his old habits misses the flight back to paris and soon dies the movie is overly long but gordon is mesmerizing dexter speaks slowly as if from behind a veil gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in mexico when he agreed to do the movie he had much input on the film creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy the picture has faults to be sure but it s a mighty achievement nonetheless the music of which there is plenty is of course top notch 
i love this movie this is one of my favorite love movies i just left another review for another movie and decided i needed to leave one for my favorite movie as well great job to nia long and lorenze tate nia long s father was my high school teacher and that is how i got introduce to her years ago this movie is cozy and cute and i enjoy every time i watch it 
brings back childhood dreams of afica i love this series mainly for the memories it brings back about years ago when i was around our family would go to my grandmother s on sunday evening gathering around the tv to watch masterpiece theater at pm this was the only series that we watched regurlarly until it was over it imprinted itself on my mind and sent it soaring i enjoy it now because of this i don t know that i would recommend it to an adult there are a few weaknesses but i would reccomend it for children the story is uplifting adventurous moral exotic everything that sends a child s mind into its own fantastic dreamland 
not as gory as one may think i ll try not to add comments that others have already made one thing i ll say is that it is not the horror flick that many make the film out to be grow up ! yes there were some scenes that make you shiver but this is not a film just going around maiming animals and characters that like s m as other reviews tend to portray maybe i grew up watching too many horror movies or else reading all these reviews about the gore and violence built up my expectations of what i was to encounter or else i just watch too much of the daily news whatever the reason don t go watch the film thinking it s going to be an all out horror show its about emotions conjured up through anger betrayal and love it hits the sensitive areas of relationships put yourself into the character s place how would you feel and what would you do maybe not the fish hooks as far as all the peta comment of which i m not a member they cry foul over eating a chicken ! worse stuff happens over here in the us keep in mind it s a different culture you re seeing in the film in vietnam and other parts of asia they eat dogs other parts of the world may frown on us eating chickens and cows and pigs we don t have to prepare our animals we just buy it packaged and ready to cook the gross stuff is done for us the so called gross animal scenes are fast and the camera doesn t loom on the animal so it s an inconsequential part of the scene so what they put it in a film i ve seen documentaries on how steak and pork chops are prepared and no one says it s a no no to show the frog incident she knocked out and skinned a frog to eat feed to the guys bird she didn t skin it first when it was alive it s not like we don t eat meat over here her economic status didn t allow her to go to the local shaws market and get one skinned and trimmed you see last year what people did to chickens being raised for i think kfc they were stomping and kicking them for the fun of it on the internet i saw a clip of kids putting a live kitten in a cage pour gas all over it then light the poor thing on fire the fish incidents if you ve ever prepared a fish its no big deal yes it was mean to hack up a fish guys was pissed or to run current through it lady was pissed but it was trying to convey the anger the characters had in them same with the lady slapping the dog around she didn t beat it to death she was mad it didn t want to go out on the boat and boat house plus she wasn t very happy although it doesn t make it right fresh sushi can t get it any fresher than that if you watch the movie the fish didn t die as it was caught by the male main character later then set free to show his pity for it yes the fish hook scenes were not pleasant to watch but a the guy didn t swallow the hooks that far as evidenced by the lady taking them out with a pair of pliers and b you dont see her inserting the fish hooks into any place just up her dress there s no clear shot of what she does she did bleed quite a bit but wouldn t you if you did that i ve seen much worse in horror flicks and the news anyway there s lots more to this film than just the gore and animal mistreatment go see the movie with a blank slate and you ll like it better but the ending is a little curious 
exceptionally well made this movie requires patience there is no gripping storyline that edges you out of your seat there are no profound messages weaved into the dialogues but once you understand that you ll find that the storyline in yi yi might surprisingly be like your own there is no central theme to the movie nor do the characters suddenly experience life changing events in the course of a few weeks other than a wedding funeral and a child birth very little changes in the long term but isn t that how real life is problems aren t really solved they just pass over time and it just might be mundane events of family life that defines who you are as a person with each viewing i have grown to appreciate this movie even more the new dvd edition is beautifully edited and is much much better than the version i watched it during a rainy day when there were no distractions highly recommended 
one of the best movies ever made one of the best dvds ever made butch cassidy and the sundance kid is one of the best films ever made and fox has recently released a fitting two disc dvd edition of the film fitting because the dvd is one of the best i have ever seen directed by george roy hill and written by william goldman the god of screenwriters butch cassidy and the sundance kid stars paul newman robert redford and katharine ross how could a film with this pedigree be anything but good what you may not realize or know is that this film made robert redford the star he is today paul newman already an established star having appeared in hud cool hand luke and the hustler among others was a bankable star and the film was made because he agreed to make it initially he wanted to play the sundance kid but eventually settled on the role of cassidy robert redford was not new to film but he was nowhere near the icon he would become he had some early success which was followed by a few clunkers the pair became a match made in heaven and would go on to appear in more films together on screen they appear to be friends much like their characters and this adds to the charm of their relationship redford clearly recognizes the influence this film had on his career his famous film academy and film festival are named after his character in the film butch and sundance decide to rob the mail car of a train owned by a powerful rail baron butch is tired of the work and wants to retire but he needs one or two big scores to set him up after blowing up the rail car they run off with the loot and hide out in a small town at a brothel they frequent meeting up with the rest of their gang they quell a revolt and decide to do one more job they will rob the same mail car on the same railway on its next run through the area it is the perfect crime no one would suspect the same train being robbed so it will probably be loaded with money after blowing up the car for a second time they notice another locomotive speeding towards them and a crew of men on horseback alight from the car and give chase chasing butch and sundance and their two accomplices for days across many terrains finally they realize the rail baron has hired a famous indian tracker to help a band of men including a former sheriff who is now a famous bounty hunter catch the duo after the chase they return to the home of ella katharine ross the sundance kid s girlfriend tired they decide to leave the country and travel to bolivia and begin robbing banks there as i watched this dvd of butch cassidy two things quickly became apparent this film is virtually timeless with the lone exception of the song raindrops keep falling on my head the film could ve been made yesterday the images are so clear the second is that the dvd print is one of the most beautiful transfers i have ever watched the cinematography by conrad hall who would later work on american beauty among others is simply stunning and brings out all of the rich detail of the landscape everything is crisp and clear when it is supposed to be colors are bright and vivid it s just beautiful to watch it doesn t hurt that the stars are two of the most handsome men to ever appear in film at the prime of their careers and one of the most beautiful women to ever co star how did anyone get past all of that eye candy the key to becoming fully invested in this film is william goldman s screenplay he introduces the characters in action we learn as we go and they are almost always moving or doing something goldman fills their mouths with witty dialogue showing us how their relationship works and they are instantly likeable to us this is basically a love triangle with ross ella playing the go between the two men have a very close friendship enjoying each other s company but cassidy loves ella as well even appears slightly jealous until he realizes his friend is the recipient of this woman s love so they get along then there is the famous chase the railway baron s men chase butch and sundance for days taking up a significant chunk of the film but this scene proves to us how committed the two men are to each other and makes their future trek to bolivia all the more believable we have to believe there is a real threat and these men never let up on the chase if they catch butch and sundance they will be killed as soon as they reach bolivia goldman has a lot of fun with the characters again exploring their relationships rebuilding them in a way and making them light hearted again it is almost amazing to watch this film because if a studio executive were presented with the same screenplay today it would probably not be made it doesn t hit plot points at pre determined pages it tells an unconventional story and we never actually see the villains goldman had the luxury of writing this film during a period in which studios were still able to work with somewhat unconventional screenplays of course they wanted to make money as well but they still considered film an art form george roy hill is an underappreciated director i think a large part of this is because many of his films are very humorous comedy is not as highly respected in hollywood as drama even though making a good comedy is much more difficult so i suspect the humorous elements of most of his films made him less respected in hollywood but when your films are as good as butch cassidy and the sundance kid and the sting you deserve some respect he made his share of duds but when he passed away a few years ago hollywood was robbed of a talent ready to make at least a few more classics during this period big screen westerns were becoming unpopular perhaps the dearth of television westerns was keeping the public out of the theaters but this genre was considered risky at the time recent films starring burt lancaster and others were failing to light the box office fire the second disc contains a new making of feature including interviews with newman redford ross former studio executives david brown and richard zanuck and more zanuck reveals that he took a real chance in greenlighting this film but fought for it all the way he also haggled with hill and the filmmakers in an attempt to keep the budget under control he became concerned when the film was projected to cost about million consider the average studio film now costs at least million but the film would go on to be a big hit such a huge hit the filmmakers followed this with the equally popular the sting the second dvd also contains some archival interviews with the stars some trailers and more in the making of documentary they discuss the inclusion of the song raindrops keep falling on my head people fought against it but hill and composer burt bacharach felt it would be the perfect accompaniment to the scene of butch and ella riding a new fangled bike through her barn yard it does work but it is clearly not a fit for the period depicted in the film and is the most dated element within the film today it just seems silly today butch cassidy and the sundance kid is a superlative example of the treatment all classics should receive on dvd this is a film every dvd library should have

a five star double rated astro navigatrix the s were an era of terrifically beautiful actresses ranging from ursula andress to the starlets of hammer film productions among the highest order of cinematic goddesses was young jane fonda whose performance in the title role of barbarella remains extremely erotic todays more explicit sexuality notwithstanding the film s slight storyline concerns a futuristic astronavigatrix trying to track down a mad scientist and prevent him from using a horrific weapon that he invented hot on his trail our heroine encounters all manner of intergalactic beings who do their best to separate her from her unusually frail space girl costumes a blind angel sadistic leather men children w carnivorous dolls and a tyrannical lesbian queen are all eager to entice barbarella into their various fun games finally when the space girl does catch up to her quarry the crazed scientist wonderfully named duran duran he too wants to work out his fantasies on her he subjects her to his excessive machine a pleasant torture device that supposedly kills by inducing a lethal number of orgasms ! fortunately barbarella s capabilities outlast the machine causing it to collapse in broken fuses and so it goes until the less thaninevitable but happy finale all in all this film s fantastic episodes are brilliant inspired barbarella s narrow escape from flesh eating dolls as well as her many encounters with the lesbian tyrant played to the hilt by anita pallenberg are truly imaginative sequences other highlights include the film s initial scene with barbarella doing a strip tease in a zero gravity chamber and her down anddirty defeat of duran duran s nasty machine in essence there are very few dull moments in the entire film director roger vadim jane fonda s husband at the time was at the height of his considerable powers and mistress fonda herself was glorious in such an unlikely role her extreme beauty blended harmoniously with an essential innocence in a way that made her the cinematic descendant of marilyn monroe ! for any actress at any time there can be no higher praise than comparison with marilyn and in jane fonda s case such comparison is actually deserved my highest ratings 
dark love story this film should be up there on your need to watch list it s a brilliantly casted and wonderfully scripted story of blind love when luis bandaras meets his mail orderbride julia jolie he is stunned at her beauty she is nothing like he expected yet he marries her immediatly luis is the perfect gentleman and that makes julia s next move even harder once she has gained luis trust she leaves him taking him for every cent luis then with the help of a p i decides he will find her and kill her the problem is that he still loves her but does she love him this film shows the dark side of love the side that allows you to love someone you don t even know but can feel someone you connect with someone that makes you whole jolie and bandaras are spot on especially with their clothes off hot hot hot and they work wonders with this script i have watched this film over and over and still can t get enough of it the unrated version of this film offers a steamier and much more explicet love scene with movement and lots of nudity no full frontal bandaras shots though you ll have to settle for quite a few butt shots and it includes a few other sex scenes less explicet that were cut from the movie entirly either way you ll be pleasently pleased the unrated version doesn t add anything new to the plot and or the flow of the film so pursue only if you re in dire need for a near pornlike nude scene otherwise the theatrical version is just fine and you still see quite a bit of nudity great acting great story great bodies what can i say but great movie 
if you want to have a great time then see this film this is the standard for all other musketeers films save your time as they are generally not worth the time money if you want to see and get the feel for what the th century was like then this is the place to go it is obvious that the high power cast and the staff was having blast while doing a labor of love i can not recommend this classic too highly ! a well done to all hands especially for the dvd version 
viva reform school girls i saw this movie back in the s when i was a mere years now at and a year old girl later i picked a copy up and watched it with my daughter she looked at me like i was crazy during the first five minutes it did not take long before she was rooting on wendy o williams now it is her new found favorite movie aaahhh the decadent s pick this one up and show your kids what your guilty pleasures are they will love you for it 
great episode this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see 
brilliant satire proof once again that the brits make the best films this film would never be made in america its blend of social satire comedy political comment and underlying seriousness makes this film unique that someone could call this film frothy is incomprehensible to me it is a deft satire with a serious message without ever seeming serious the film makes you think while it is entertaining you guiness is superb as the brilliant but clueless scientist who invents a fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out seems great doesn t it but a worker at the plant where sidney guinness works sees what he doesn t that they will only have to make one lot so labor turns against the idea and of course management wants to suppress it in favor of planned obsolescence it is all delicious fun all the way all the while making you think about modern consumer driven economies the cast is composed of ealing regulars all of whom turn in top notch performances this is one of the all time great films don t miss it 
heartwarming family entertainment this is another of my childhood favorites i never thought i would be able to find it on dvd this is definitely a film to add to your collection 
made us all laugh wonderful vehicle enjoyed by everyone in our household allowed my boys to see that even with ineptness and bungling the underdog can win and you don t need to watch a movie with blood and gore to enjoy a movie we work with mostly inner city kids in a rural setting kids that usually watch the more grizzly stuff it was truly a pleasure to hear them all laugh without reserve 
visitatori there are four kinds of sci fi people go to the stars star trek etc aliens come to earth v etc aliens interact with other aliens dune etc earth of the near mad max or distant future time machine the v mythology developed the second category in important ways that impacted both kids and big people too without v would we have had independence day or men in black v also made an impact overseas in september in florence i heard a street vendor who was fatigued with the surge of tourists sigh visitatori his analogy was very well taken vfans hope for another sequel the projected v the second generation sounds a lot like star trek tng there are other possible names v files v men v hur aliens attack ancient rome in a prequel v zilla aliens attack japan v ventura aliens abduct rich italians on a desert island but nobody cares one star was taken away because the dvd producers have masked the top and bottom of the image but the director commentary is a big plus 
it s not that they re stupid they just don t know anything stand and deliver is one of my favorite movies it s the story of a man who begins teaching at a high school in the slums of los angeles expecting to teach computer science when he arrives what he instead finds is that there is not computer department and he s stuck teaching basic math to a bunch of social misfits the beginning of this movie sets the stage wonderfully by showing us the kind of people who inhabit the city as he drives through it on the way to the first day of school when he arrives at the school we see the students in their natural environment and a rough one it is what is a teacher to do the protagonist of this awe inspiring story jaime escalante is a wonderful example of what can happen when a person chooses to adapt to certain environments and not adapt to others when he s given the task of educating a group of kids that includes some scary gang member type looking kids instead of acting like a teacher he acts tough right back reminding them that they re in his domain yet when he s brought into a room with the other teachers and school staff he goes against the grain when the school s head advisor tells the principle that everyone is doing their best he immediately says that he s not and when she tells the principle that escalante is asking too much of his students he boldly tells her that the students will rise to the expectations of their teacher this alone makes the movie interesting but what adds even more drama to situation is the fact that each and every student in the class escalante teaches has their own peer pressures to deal with some students have unsavory friends who would laugh at their taking a class seriously some of the students have boyfriends or girlfriends who don t understand their sudden interest in school and some of the students have to deal with parents who don t understand why their education should come before taking care of their own family as the movie progresses escalante announces to the board that he wants to teach calculus to his best students despite the fact that the students hadn t studied any of the prerequisites for the course naturally this requires them to study through their summer break and then six days a week with extra hours in any teen environment there is always peer pressure but what happens when positive peer pressure conflicts with negative peer pressure when our gang member type angel first starts the class he is hesitant to get involved because of his rough and tough friends when escalante singles him out however the pressure of the teacher is greater than the pressure of his friends over time this has a tremendous effect on him towards the end of the movie he s riding with his friend and starts acting stupid and gets his friend a traffic ticket when the guy becomes angry with him and wants to fight angel just walks away what does this say about him as a person to me it shows that whether he likes it or not he no longer belongs with his old associates he s now turning into a responsible individual as i said before at the outset of the movie escalante is the one who is thrown into pressure groups he could become just like the other teachers or just become uncaring like the kids in his class were initially what he does instead is nothing short of a miracle he uses his understanding of human nature and the natural tendency of people to work better when their thoughts are united to his advantage his class becomes its own little world a club for the elite the strong and the brave and early on when one of the students refuses to take a test the other students quickly turn against her and ridicule her she then quickly becomes obedient and gets back to work positive peer pressure was too much for her the harder the students are pushed and the more is expected of them the more they feel like a team how can i forget the scene where a student says that the rest of the class will have a better chance of making it without him the driving force of the scholastic miracle and this movie is escalante as he himself said if the students don t have the desire he will give it to them and that s exactly what he did he made them want to succeed he made them have the motivation to keep pushing and striving for higher and higher goals basically he educated them on how to be successful and hard working individuals people who normally wouldn t have anything to do with each other computer nerds homeboys and rockers all were united by their desire to achieve and make themselves into something great they pushed themselves harder than anyone had ever done in their lives and when push came to shove they were successful in every way every single student escalante taught passed the exam for college credit every one motivation is a powerful thing and sometimes if you don t already have it an extraordinary person can give it too you everyone should see this movie 
razor sharp like cactus this is one of the best western i have seen where alan ladd s performance is powerful razor sharp with a whip lashing command in his voice who went to rob the cattle baron charles bickford of their fortune as their long lost son somewhere along the line he had a change of heart and brings home their real lost son who was removed from the family when he was only yrs old and given to a mexican bandit across the river who raised him as his own i think it is one of the must have movies 
talk about christmas spirit i really love bones it has everything suspense drama humor pretty people fun storylines i have yet to miss an episode and even into season this is probably my favorite it adds depth to all of the characters also the winter holidays are my favorite time of year i like holidays that are about what is good in the world bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day i cry through half this episode but in a completely good way buy watch it love it but watch it with a friend if you don t want to cry alone so moving great performances by the whole cast emily deschanel was powerful in this one she brings real vulnerability to brennan here david boreanaz as always the perfect sympathetic hero loveably old fashioned cute funny moments touching poignant moments this really is the best of what is great about bones 
trapped in the cube cube is a cult hit that basically means that it s good or innovative but not many people know about it vincenzo natali also creator of cypher and nothing made his full length directorial debut with this film a low budet innovative sci thriller that feels like an episode of the twilight zone as written by mark danielewski and franz kafka yes it s that surreal and that intelligent and well writtenseven people have been placed in a cubical room which is connected to a bizarre maze of thousands more among are a cop a disabled man an architect a student a doctor and a criminal and all of them have wildly disparate personalities but they soon learn that behind the countless doors there are deadly booby trapsso of course their chances of survival don t seem so good but they soon learn that their placement in the cube is no accident each one has skills that the group needs to escape they will have to band together and use their brains but why are they in the cube in the first place and is the maze even the same as when they started vincenzo natali s cube is a perfect example of what hollywood can t seem to grasp it doesn t matter how much money is poured into a movie because it s the concept brains and skill that make it good or bad not the special effects or the big names and natali did a magnificent job with his first full length movie infusing what seems to be a straightforward thriller with a taut claustrophobic atmosphere and some ominous hints about morality or the lack of it and sociology it also has an unusually intelligent script with prime numbers and their powers playing a big part right next to the gruesome deaths and of course the solid dialogue youve got a gift its not a gift it s just a brain at the heart of the creepiness natali only reveals the secrets of the cube as they are revealed to the characters which adds to the suspense what is this thing why are they in it we know as much as they do and we re only going to find out more about it when they do its also a movie that bothers to have real characters no screaming teens here the movie s plot depends on them being very different natali and andr bijelic reveal the characters through their action and dialogue some are whiny some are cruel and some are just annoying some of the acting is rather flat and a few of the arguments ring hollow but overall it s very like watching real people vincenzo natali s cube gives a good name to shoestring budgets and eerie plots definitely deserving of its cult status bizarre twisted and creepy 
one of the great american novels this edition of little women is great ! first of all there s the wonderful story of the march family in the years during and after the civil war as the daughters meg jo beth and amy grow to womanhood experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy this edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original i have read versions of the novel in which the girls grammar is cleaned up for them in addition the introduction by susan cheever is first rate it is neither too long or too short and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying another reason why i so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure to modern readers terms and obsolete slang also there s a nice essay review by g k chesterson who warmly praises alcott s book 
it deserves stars an awesome engaging powerful movie i loved it james woods was absolutely wonderful there were many other actors who also gave great performances i can t comment too much on this film because it seems to make people very angry my husband watched it as well and he is originally from ukraine not the ukraine as some folks say i think that people need more exposure to other countries and cultures and open their hearts and minds a little or a lot and try to understand i guess that s just wistful thinking i loved the movie it was a damn good movie my husband also enjoyed for the same reason i ve seen it more than once no matter what side you were or are on there seems to be an element of truth there if the story is going to make you angry then don t watch it ! if you can keep an open mind and watch it purely for entertainment value then watch it and enjoy it i might add that i really liked the dvd s extras after watching the film first time i watched it again with the director s commentary i believe that there was also a documentary which i also enjoyed good insight into central america 
awesome i really like the pokemon movies and i was not dissapointed with this one i have watched it about times over the past several years team rocket never plays as big of arole as in the t v show though 
a perfect foil to the devil wears prada i have loved this movie since i was a kid it is a cute s romantic comedy with fashion and reluctant romance thrown in very dated in the mores and attitudes of the time but a great time capsule of fasion in the sand in paris it s a great supplement to prada which is sort of a miss congeniality goes to paris not great drama but wonderful fun with paul newman and marice chevalier ! it is a delight 
intriguing i ve watched this movie many times because i m fascinated by the man especially hoping to get a better understanding of what his life was like the more i learn about him though the more this movie is so one dimensional and inaccurate it was based on the harshest biography of picasso which is unfortunate because it gives a false impression of what he was really like i would still buy it because the scenes are filled with his studios and artwork however it would have been one of my all time faves if it focused more on his work and his passion 
one of the best halloween toons ever until this was recently released on dvd as part of the garfield holiday celebrations the only way to see this was if you had owned in on vhs since they don t show this one on tv anyore that s such a shame as this is one fantastic halloween special it originally appeared on cbs in garfield and odie go trick or treating and wind up in a real haunted house much to their horror lorenzo music was hilarious as garfield and tom huge was fantastic as john and binky the clown if you love the season of halloween and autumn time then this is the perfect animated feature to watch what a treat that this is now on dvd 
thank you for the tribute to fleisher superman cartoons the superman serials from columbia had cartoons in tribute to the fleisher cartoons of a few year before it was very creative and thinking out of the box carol forman is great in her continuing quest to take over the world this serial is a hoot 
great update from a classic prison flick this film was actually a remake of the film caged starring eleanor parker and agnes moorehead made in the s this film was remade with a s rock and roll feel the lets play the name game scene is an exact duplicate of cmon you tramps line up for count where the girls get off their bunk beds stand in line and recite their name when you compare the two matrons of each movie they could pass for sisters wendy o williams was great understand she was tragically killed in a bike accident just about months after this film was made sybil danning who played the warden is a several prison made movie woman herself playing in great films like caged heat this is a good dvd and a camp remake of a classic prison film

very hilarious truely speaking this is a very hilarious episode must see for every one 
twisted love story this movie is definitely a different kind of love story it really surprised me the first time i saw it it s a very honest movie that deals with issues that other movies rarely touch on like self mutilation and masochism i think that the actors were very convincing and that this movie is worth every penny i don t want to spoil it but it s a must see 
informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
i wish i was in dixie this is one of the best movie about the civil war i ve ever seen it is the most instructive realistic with very good actors playing in it ! for once just like in gods and generals the movie is more focused on the southern side which is not very often the case i am a fan of this part of the u s history and especially of the south and i was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end 
dated sure boring no way i watched this with my year old daughter last night she was into it with her short attention span for the whole film one pleasant surprise it has a pretty good chase scene i like chase scenes any sf fan will welcome this in his her collection a few good comic shots watch richard benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the jail break 
a good smart funny movie as soon as i walked out of the theater i declared that i had to own a copy of this movie i had to wait a long time for it to be released to dvd it was in theaters in late winter but they didn t put it to dvd till almost a year later probably hoping to capitalize on awards season reviews and recommendations it was well worth the wait it is a shame that this film was overlooked with the awards i think that the timing of the release factored in but maybe it just appeals to some people like me more than others the entire ensemble does a great job i just rewatched it and i still enjoy it after at least viewings it would make a wonderful addition to your video collection especially if you are a michael douglas fan and having a pittsburgh connection helps too the movie really captured a lot of the essence of pittsburgh even with the weather when there is snow on the ground the sun is peeking through and it is raining all at the same time it is just a good movie all around and should appeal to viewers who enjoy smart films there are just truly funny scenes and some really touching parts what a wild journey these characters find themselves on over the span of just one weekend i think the best part is that it isn t non stop action and things don t get so out of the realm of possibility it still retains a good touch of believability even as some pretty unbelievable things happen pick up the soundtrack while you are at it bob dylan s things have changed is great and it recieved an oscar it is mostly a cd to just kick back and relax to 
profound beautiful but little known film ellen burstyn at her best this is one of the most spiritual and beautiful films ever made and it is by far the best work by ellen burstyn who doesnt get the recognition of a meryl streep but is every bit as good for some reason this film has never been released on dvd and it is a shame as the film is timeless and offers a most beautiful depiction of the human spirit perhaps the most conservative religious viewers may be a bit challenged by the film but it offers a true test of human tolerance and perhaps the best view of love ever put on film it is a must see film and the more people that see it the better the world will be i was forever touched by the film 
it s jimmy carr need more be said thanks for keeping a brit sane in a country full of my wife says jokes your wife is fat and ugly and i don t care what she says because she s ugly and fat and not my wife

one of the best political movies ever robert redford and dustin hoffman deliver oscar worthy performances while jason robards won an oscar for best supporting actor in this moviewhich is in my opinion one of the best political films ever made i m not even sure if it was nominated for best picture but i have to say this moviewas better than rocky ok the movie won four academy awards the one i mentioned above best adapted screenplay best art direction and best sound it s also rated pg which is strange because they use the word f k at least times in this movie and nowadays two uses can get you slapped with an r rating but the movie opens as we witness four men breaking into the watergate building which we all know was the setting for democratic national headquarters the police show up and catch the men in the act of setting up survelliance bugging the place and the story shows upbob woodward s redford desk woodward is a reporter at the washington post who reports the story and then begins to see oddities about it why would men break into the democratic national headquarters who sent them etc eventually joining in the act of helping him is carl bernstein hoffman who begin a thorough investigation of the scandal that begins to turrn up names very high up in government and eventually even the president of the united states richard nixon bernstein and woodward worked their a es off to get this story through apparent death threats and when people wouldn t talk to them and they got it all right robards plays their boss ben bradlee and deserved his oscar another performance that was really good although his face is almost entirely hidden in shadow is hal holbrook as the mysterious deep throat deep throat was one of woodward s informants who apparently worked high up in the government and seemed to know everything about the watergate cover up except he refused to just give up and information only hints and could never be directly quoted or even referred to woodward to this day has not given up the identity of deep throat or even gave the vaguest idea of who he might ve been anyway for a movie about reporters trying to unravel a cover up this movie was incredibly entertaining and exciting it s never boring it s never dull both hoffman redford play their parts extraordinarily well which causes us to like the movie even more and it s strange too the movie doesn t end with nixon resigning but instead ends with nixon taking his nd oath of office we re given the remainder of the details as they re typed up on a typewriter i though the ending was abrupt but perfect grade a 
this model is not soft i took a lot of time researching work out videos i had read an article about cindy crawford having her baby completely natuarl with a midwife i was intrigued then i saw a special on models on vh again i was intrigued a friend recommended this video saying her roommate did it faithfully and got a great body basically the video has three segments one minute one minute and then one minute it incorporates simple lunges and squats with some aerobic cardio and weights cindy and kathy and very upbeat but not in a cheesy way cindy is way impressive since she just had a baby you might think you would pass on this video since it is for post natal exercise but i am telling you to keep it it works i worked out with the video a couple of times this week and i love it it was beautifully shot and had pleasant music the workout wasn t hard but it wasn t easy i woke up the next morning completely sore and unable to barely sit down this work out definitely sneaks up on you i am going to incorporate this video with running a few times a week and i can t wait to see the changes buy this video

simply beautiful buy this dvd today be sure to purchase the boxset as it is the only way to get the richard pryor special and mudbone bonus footage this groundbreaking series paved the way for not only the obvious in living color and chappelles show but other subversive tv like south park which attempt to inject social commentary while challenging the censors it not only captures pryor at his comedic peak but gives us early glimpses of folks like robin williams sandra berhard marsha warfield and john witherspoon this show has never been available on home video and has basically been out of circulation since its initial run thus it is a jewel to behold watching pryor as quotthe quotmojoquot quotthe first black president quot and quotrev white quotwho has his own way to drum up quotthe big bucks quot will have you laffing for hours but pryor also presents scketches that weren t designed to be laugh out loud funny but challenge you in other ways like the wino sketch that turns into a maya angelo performance or the quotsatin doll quot sketch which has no laughs at all but aims to capture the feeling of post wwii black america with a fantastic song anddance number starring paula kelly choreographed by michael peters i seriously doubt these five hours of television would have come out the same if the nbc censors had been completely undertanding sensitive and supportive of mr pryor s vision the special is an extension of mr pryor s hosting of snl the subsequent series itself reminds me of marvin gaye s here my dear while it is not marvin s most listenable or even best work through pain he finds beauty and truth this boxset is a must have for fans of tv comedy and shoud be copped by any means necessary

a great classic this was the first animation that i have ever seen and i was amazed at the quality and how real all of the characters looked on toy story it is so easy to fall in love with the toys and characters in this movie and the animation that pixar has brought is amazing since toy story pixar has brought us lo lot of wonderful animations to love and most of which are top rated films but i will always remember that toy story started it all not only because toy story started the love of animmation in my heart but because this movie was so brilliantly animated and designed

the spoiled princess s of manhattan uptown girls starring brittany murphy and dakota fanning is quite delightful about a rich girl murphy who loses her inheritance and must become one of the normal people she has to get a real job gasp donald faison and heather locklear also star fanning has never been more than a pain in the rump for this particular role but she is one of the most talented young actress since jodie foster murphy has great range as an actress every role she commits to she delivers a clean enerergtic performance as always the ending is so cute that it s embarrassing this movie works so well it s predictable melodramatic and formulatic but i defintely enjoyed this feel good comedy from two gifted actress 
great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch

clever comment on reaganism set in a galaxy of post transformational liberalism just kidding i don t know what i m talking about you should see this movie if you like sex nudity hot babes mickey rourke carre otis mickey rourke and carre otis going at it for real perfume commercials directors trying to make their softcore porn look like art by filming everything sensually and in slow motion so the film appears to be arthouse and visually stimulating really really really bad dialogue lots of good banging and screwing without a plot mickey rourke playing a total pimp which is different than just mickey rourke i mean there s mickey rourke and then there s mickey rourke the pimp which is even cooler and finally hot female characters who wear glasses and carry around clipboards so the audience believes they are smart and successful businesswomen when in fact they d have a hard time calculating also see alone in the dark tara reid s character or fantastic four jessica alba s highly recommended to the appropriate demographic i could kill myself for buying it

simon and garfunkel old friends this concert is their best one on dvd in my opinion the quality of sound and picture is good along with the fact that they stick to the original style of the song without changing it too much for the stage it s a mellow and enjoyable concert to kick back and watch with some old friends 
dustin collection what a classic good sound and picture and if you want to see jon and dustin starting out get this dvd ! 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
an intruiging plot with a good message insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies and the consequnces they can produce it is very well acted on both pacino s and williams part and swank was brilliant as well besides all that good stuff i am also a fan of the director ever since i saw batman begins and find his artistic vision to be incredible the only problem i had with this movie was the ending sure it showed how lying could defeat a person but i thought a little redemption would have been nice however if you have a strong stomach or a good editing company i suggest you see this 
outstanding blending music with ski snowboard video and travel this is a must see if you dont want to go to a mountain afterwards then you have no soul my only complaint is that it is already geared towards people that already love to ski snowboard i would have liked more descriptions of the terrain and better shots showing just how steep some of those cliffs are for people that have never skied this movie will be slow going at first but patient it gets better again my only complaint is that it assumes people watching already know what powder and big mountains feel like a little extra effort could have been made to portray that to the new skier 
the postman this was a very good movie it had alot of action a love story content and it had a bit of humor to it ! i enjoyed it very much 
oh my looorrrrdddd bring out the tissues what a beautiful and heartbreaking movie when i first saw this at the theaters i swear i wasn t only crying but sobbing i still sob watching this moving movie this was an original idea for a movie at that time bob jones is dying played by the gorgeous michael keaton and his wife gail is expecting their first child so thinking he may not be around long or at all after the birth he tapes his life for his child to look back on as they get older i don t think anyone in the universe could watch this dry eyed he goes and revisits the house he grew up in he teaches his son how to shave he gives all the fatherly advice to his future son that kids learn from their living parents it s a beautiful heartwarming story that is acted well and will flood your house you must see this if you are a fan of a love story between husband and wife and father and baby look out for queen latifah as theresa the nurse and listen out for the beautiful score in this movie

if not altman s greatest film certainly one of his top five this along with nashville are my favorite altman films this is one of the most beautiful haunting sad and poetic westerns ever made actually to call it a western is a bit misleading as it may be technically a western it is much more than that the leonard cohen soundtrack fits in so well with the film amazingly the songs by cohen were not written specifically for the film altman was a major cohen fan and got permission from leonard to use his songs for his film thank you mr leonard cohen i can t really imagine this film without them most of the songs here appear on leonard s album songs of leonard cohen album the stranger song the song that plays over the opening credits sets the mood so perfectly for the entire film the look of the film is one of the more unique in cinematic history it was achieved through various filters at the time vilmos zigmond the cinematographer didn t get the look in the lab but in the camera which made it look as good as it does dreyer s vampyr has a similar other worldly look like this film except that film had a light leak in the camera in other words that was a happy accident this film was a deliberate attempt at a new cinematic look and it succeeds in spades this is great filmmaking the performances are astounding as well beatty and christie are wonderful and keith carradine is superb in a small but tragic role this is one of altman s greatest films a film that you can watch over and over again 
fanatastic micheal odeds characters were intense watched the whole seaon one it was really good now i m just upset that season two downloads aren t available what s the holdup 
prom night i enjoyed the movie very much i m a collector of old b rated movies as well of the s hope to see more of the same 
not your typical movie and i mean that in a good way this movie first came out when i was about years old i remember going into the cinema in the local mall which was torn down long ago and seeing carboard cutouts of hawn willis and streep of course i had no idea who they were but the image of willis s hand going through hawn s stomach is tough to forget i also remember seeing a tv special on the making of this movie because at that time the special effects used were ultra hightechof course i didn t see the movie in the theater i was awful young a few years after its theatrical run maybe two somebody in my family saw this movie on sale at randall s as a used video and bought it at a discount i enjoyed the movie particularly because at that point i d seen nothing where the major theme centered around a fountain of youth it s a fascinating concept when done well as done here the plot s unusual two bitter woman rivals obsessed with vanity drink a magical potion that keeps them young forever so no matter what awful things they do to one another they remain alive even after they re classified as clinically dead unfortunately their bodies take quite a beating and need the upkeep of a plastic surgeon so they try to get dr ernest menville willis to drink the potion too there s a lot more to the story actually since dr menville has had very intimate relationships with both women in the past the build up of this story is quite beautiful although a bit sketchy when addressing hawn s party at the beginning ill close by saying that there are a few scenes of nude female behinds every now and then whoa 
i had forgotten how charming this movie is this is from a time when europe loved us in a way the premise of the plot was thatall a little country had to do to prosper was to declare war on the united staes lose quickly and reap the benefits of defeat by a generous victor how it all goeswrong is delightful seeing this in the light of recent history gives a delicious sense of irony peter sellers went on to star in dr stranglove 
it is all a lie although it might seem like an odd starting point the first time i heard of kurosawa s rashomon was when i read iris chang s rape of nanking for the first time a few years ago within this book she alluded to the film because of the various stories detailing the atrocities committed in nanking differed greatly depending on the source of information anyway a couple of years after that i read akutagawa ryuunosuke s short story rashomon and noticed that it really did not fit chang s brief description of the movie and it was not until i read a later short story in the collection in the grove did i find the actual short story the film was based on the film rashomon was western film audiences first real exposure to the films of kurosawa akira and it ignited the flame of interest in kurosawa s films for decades to come and with good reason because rashomon is truly an excellent film and it still tops best films ever made lists constantly during a terrible rainfall three men a priest a woodcutter and a bandit duck into the ruins of the rashomon gate to escape the massive downpour the priest and the woodcutter have just returned from a court case detailing the murder of a samurai by the bandit tajomaru listening to tajomaru s testimony it seems like a pretty cut and dry case he wanted the samurai s wife for his own and after raping her he killed her husband as she asked him to do however after listening to the wife s story and even the dead husband s story through a medium it is hard to say what the truth isthe old saying goes history is written by the victors and rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view the same events but how lies thread their way into the truth and corrupt it kurosawa depicts the scene with the samurai his wife and the bandit tajomaru four times within the film s minutes and the resulting juxtaposition is quite enjoyable 
lesser known but top notch video celebrating an obscure day i cannot remember ever seeing this peanuts video as a kid but since my son is now thoroughly enjoying his discovery of the peanuts gang i purchased this for him to watch i find that it s now one of my all time favorite peanuts videos a very close second to quota charlie brown christmas quot the sentimental favorite your kids won t even realize that they are learning about arbor day or helping preserve green space because the message is so seamlessly integrated into the fun the plot is simple the gang decides to turn charlie brown s baseball field into a park in honor of arbor day there are so many priceless moments when snoopy gets ejected from the library for laughing too hard at doggie obedience texts snoopy s fight with the creeping vine peppermint patty s attempt to get charlie brown to explain love to her lucy s first home run patty trying to pitch around a tree that has been planted on the pitcher s mound sally s mistaken pronouncement that arbor day is quotwhen all the ships come into the arbor quot buy it watch it then go out and plant a tree with your kids 
no fool like an old fool carole bouquet is the thinner conchita who is somewhat severe angela molina is the one who dances and seems more natural jeanclaude carriere wrote the script he may be the greatest screenwriter of all time he has over a hundred credits and some of them are among the best movies ever made here s a brief list from those that i have seen the ogre valmont the unbearable lightness of being the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie diary of a chambermaid theres some symbolism in cet obscur objet du desir sometimes mathieu fernando rey carries around an old gunny sack we find out what s in it in the final scene it represents conchita s virginity the terrorists in the background seem rather contemporary although this movie is from mathieu is rich and therefore represents the established european society conchita and her friends represent the underclass both mathieu and conchita are really character types he is the masher the rake who is always working on a new conquest although he is somewhat naive she is the tease who uses her wiles to get what she can from him bunuel plays this ancient theme as a burlesque exaggerating her coyness and his foolishness the ending may suggest that in some way he has won or more likely that they are still at a standoff even while the terrorists escalate the bombings the question of why there are two actresses playing conchita has more to do with maria schneider who originally was cast in the role but left because of the nudity or because conchita s character was too contrary than it has to do with any plot or symbolic necessity on the other hand since she is that obscure object of desire which really should be that unobtainable object of desire and because bunuel wanted to emphasize that mathieu s desire for her had nothing to do with her personally he used two actresses and made it clear that mathieu didn t notice the difference ! a bit of absurdity here but bunuel is comfortable with absurdity all in all an interesting treatment of an ancient theme but not one of bunuel s best even though it was his last at age 
spectacular though this movie is an edited version of the book it captures the very essence of what charlotte bronte wrote in her classic epic drama the moodiness and movie noire gothic feeling of the sets are captured to perfection orson welles is a very convincing and plays edward rochester brilliantly joan fontaine while some may say is too fine and pretty to play jane captures her innocence inner strength and devotion to mr rochester wonderfully an added bonus are the children actors who play young jane peggy ann garner who also played in the movie a tree grows in brooklyn and helen a very young and beautiful elizabeth taylor in her first featured role in all this is a must see film i give it an a i would have given it an a if they could have made it longer to fit the whole story in i really love this movie i highly recomend you buy it 
modest but ingratiating allen effort features an effectively blowsy farrow mia farrow is the big surprise in this minor league woody allen comedy from before he started deifying hannah and her sisters and then skewering husbands and wives her image as the consummate caretaker he cast her against type as tina vitale a brassy mafioso widow in this frequently funny paean to allen s days on the borscht belt in the s she is the mistress of a loutish vegas type performer named lou canova who is represented by his woefully unsuccessful agent danny rose danny gets lou a big break a high profile gig at the waldorf astoria hotel at which milton berle is to attend and lou insists that danny take tina to the show complications ensue as when tina s mob connections think she and danny are a couple and much of the brief minute movie is about the chase which is frequently hilarious my favorite scene is when tina and danny are trapped by a thug in a huge warehouse where macy s stores their thanksgiving day floats and their voices break into a helium pitch when the bullets hit the air tanks as tina farrow submerges herself so completely in the role that in hindsight it seems a shame she didn t push for a greater variety in her film roles for once allen plays a completely sympathetic character a nice guy caught up in ludicrous circumstances that are truly not of his own doing i am not sure who nick apollo forte is but he is completely convincing as lou especially when he s onstage singing like tony bennett and acting like vegas mainstay danny gans as a framing device for the story allen assembled several famous comics at the carnegie deli to talk about danny s story led by sandy baron who later played jerry s father s adversary on seinfeld they are the ones who usually played the catskills hotel showrooms and showed up on the ed sullivan show in the s speaking of which i assume the story takes place sometime in the s but i m not sure since allen really does nothing to the set designs to make it feel like a period piece allen also jettisons his standard jazz score for the italianate lounge music that lou sings the ending is surprisingly poignant given the shenanigans that precede it within his filmography this is definitely one of his more modest efforts but along with sleeper the purple rose of cairo and manhattan murder mystery it s also one of his most ingratiating comedies other than the film s trailer there are no extras with the dvd package 
great sci fi flick in the future there is a special adult themepark called delos which has three different area adventure worlds which are medieval world west world and roman world where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember two vacationers richard benjamin and james brolin has chosen westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there s a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot yul bryner who wants to kill them amusing and fascinating sci fi thriller written and directed by the author of jurassic park michael crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it s time yul bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on the terminator this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre star wars sci fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the simpsons called itchy and scratchy land the dvd has decent picture sound with only one extras which is the original trailer but still this is a must have for anyone who likes sci fialso recommended jurassic park terminator blade runner tron robocop i robot and chopping mall 
a pirate you can t help but love this movie entertained me as a child and still does today suzanne pleshette dean jones are great but the constant scene stealing as always is done by peter ustinov his dialogue works well with the special effects that were available at the time you might forget for a moment that he s a ghost and then the movie shows the perspective from everyone else suzanne pleshette s character is trying her best not to fall in love with someone that might be crazy and can t help herself if you enjoy disney movies this one will entertain everyone i love it 
it s jimmy carr need more be said thanks for keeping a brit sane in a country full of my wife says jokes your wife is fat and ugly and i don t care what she says because she s ugly and fat and not my wife 
epic sci fi from a bygone era logans run is great nostalgic s science fiction the s was a great era for sci fi where the future was viewed with optimism awe and wonder unlike the digital age cookie cutter sci fi we get today that offers nothing but gloom and doom i was just a little kid when logans run was first released but i do remember being blown away by it s premise a futuristic society of young people living inside a futuristic domed city where you re not allowed to live past age and there s really no where for the runners those who refuse to end their lives at voluntarily to go to elude the sandmen the city s police for outside the domed city is a post apocalyptic laid in ruins earth outside somewhere near the old city of washington d c michael york plays logan one of the sandmen who turns out to have more of a heart than the city would probably prefer and richard jordan francis is his fellow sandman friend who s fiercely loyal to the city s status quo and begins to have doubts about logan s loyalty to this status quo after he finds logan hanging around the nursery the reason for all this you ll find out when you watch the movie i actually wish they had shown more of the domed city than they did it was really a cool looking structure and a fascinating sci fi concept but you see exterior and aerial visual effects shots of the city at the movie s opening and then a few glimpses afterward but after the opening shots the movie quickly gets on with the story surrounding the characters and a lot of the scenes take place in sets and scenes on location like redressed shopping malls because indoor malls were new in the s and people were still fascinated by these indoor shopping arenas so it made sense to redress one of these new malls to represent the interior of a futuristic city but the miniatures that were built for the exterior and aerial shots of the domed city are really cool to look at some people probably younger people who grew up in this cgi age ridicule the film for the city looking fake and like a model yeah if you squint you can makes out a few imperfections but so what the minatures look spectacular for their time but all the dated aspects of this film is what makes it all the more interesting imperfection is more interesting than perfection anyway but logans run is one of the last of the sci fi epics those stand alone films with like the grand mgm stamp on them everything today is so cookie cutter and bland with production companies you ve never heard of putting out direct todvd caliber movies faster than the bic corporation is putting out pens it s just not the same anymore but definately purchase logans run on dvd it s even better viewing it in widescreen as it was shown in theaters 
realistic look at s naval aviation this is one of the best movies ever made about the u s navy if nothing else the detailed scenes of a straight deck carrier operating ff panthers is fascinating many of the features of shipboard life and the procedures for carrier based jet aviation survive onboard modern cvs i m sure there were few things that could be more exciting that to be launched off a short deck in a first generation jet fighter a solid story line with good acting makes all the characters believable a true classic 
terrific for any school art department to show i m an art teacher at a middle school i show quotmichelangeloquot every year to my th graders as they study the renaissance however this can as easily be used in a college course this video not only has the specifics of his life but gives a flavor of his time 
stars for narrator stars for story if you are looking for an audio version on tape this is a fine option for this wonderful book as you can see from all the glowing reviews wind in the willows is a can tmiss classic i bought the cassettes for a long car trip with a yearold weve read re read an abridged hardback and while the story and characters provided much amusement for the full hours i was entirely sick of the narrator s syrupy voice and odd accents within minutes all that being said if this is the only audio cassette version you can find go for it

escape from l a criminally underrated cult classic okay i ll admit it john carpenter s escape from l a is one of my absolute favorite guilty pleasures where else can you see snake riding a tidal wave snake shooting hoops in order to save his life or even snake kicking the entire world s butt in an earthquake seperated los angeles from the u s and california now those who decide not to follow the rules no smoking no drugs no alcohol no women unless you re married no foul language no red meat are sent there and are not allowed to return to the u s in the president s daughter utopia has stolen the doomsday device and has fled to l a it s up to ex special forces war hero snake plissken to recover the doomsday device as well as the president s daughter within nine hours or the virus he has been injected with will kill him the r dvd from paramount features an excellent transfer of the film but unfortunately it s non anamorphic the film is presented in it s original widescreen ratio the dvd also includes a dolby digital soundtrack as well as a dolby surround soundtrack the only bonus feature on the disc is the theatrical trailer it d be nice if paramount gave us a special edition for efla containing a commentary with john carpenter and kurt russell as well as the hbo making of featurette and deleted or extended scenes if any in the end escape from l a is a minor classic that should not be missed by fans of john carpenter kurt russell or fans of escape from new york

harold squared the insatiable bud cort steals the show but is only rivaled by the complex and theoretical plot one can spend a few hours contemplating the exact allegorical comparisons between birds and humans and still feel perplexed yet satisfied do watch the film which forces the audience to quotthink outside the box quot

it delivers the goods with a story and action women in fury is simply one of the best if not the best women in prison flicks i have seen women in fury offers the standard fare we look for in wip flicks sadism lesbian scenes interrogation by firehose prison riot escape and good doses of nudity women in fury ups the ante by adding a good story to the mix and maintaining a well paced build up in the first half that appropriately turns into an action movie in the second half women in fury is the story of angela duvall who is imprisoned for the murder of a drug dealer a wet towel beating and rape by her cellmates lands her in the infirmary where the prison doctor comes to believe she is innocent of the crime while the doctor butts heads with the prison captain and investigates the circumstances of the shooting of the drug dealer a conspiracy is at hand to kill angela one of these attempts sets this movie into high gear women in fury is a brazilian movie with excellent production values only slightly marred by an occasional bad dub or cheap effect women in fury succeeds at delivering a good story maintaining a crisp pace and delivers a healthy amount of what is expected from a wip flick bo 
angela bassett halle berry halle berry is very attractive and i am sure that the roll she played in monsters ball was difficult but angela bassett deserved the monumental distinction of being the first african american actress to win a leading role oscar angela bassett played her role in this movie and not only did an excellent job but also a very realistic one of just what tina turner and countless other women have went through at the hands of an abusive man i highly recommend this movie and thank goodness tina turner survived and made it i only wish ms bassett would have been given the credit she was due by awarding her the oscar 
the bunker anthony hopkins is a fine actor who puts in another good performance the movie itself is what it is a s tv drama about insane people in an insane regime who started a world war then destroyed themselves in the en

un box revisited this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i don t see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in mb bites each hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy 
the best adaptation of wuthering heights on film this film is excellent not too long and not too short with the light and mood that would make emily bronte proud love the casting of sinead o connor as eb herself at the beginning and end ! the soundtrack is about the only element that gets to be a bit much that same series of notes over and over doesn t really do justice to the visuals even though ralph fiennes and juliette binoche are visibly considerably older than the teenaged to early twenties heathcliffe and catherine of the story they are very believable other presentations of wuthering heights have a polished sexy heathcliffe who just isn t right since heathcliffe is a monster through and through fiennes carries it off beautifully with a barely sublimated savagery showing through every scene yet remains sympathetic somehow binoche s mischievous smirk is perfect for the cathy who is more succubus than for instance merle oberon s glamorous princess in the version i don t often buy movies to own and repeatedly view so my shelf of favorites is not large but this movie is prominent among them 
i definitely have to watch it again if you ve heard of l avventura than you ve probably heard people say that this film is about nothing this is true nothing happens in this movie two movies kept popping into my head during my viewing of l avventura and they were picnic at hanging rock and the passenger the latter was directed by this films writer director michelangelo antonioni picnic at hanging rock and l avventura have a similar event take place with a similar outcome the passenger and l avventura share the same sluggish pace that will turn a lot of audiences off i think overall l avventura is one of the most beautiful films i ve ever seen it s got gorgeous cinematography and wonderful art direction if you re willing to set aside what happens in the movie and let yourself get lost not in what s happening but what s portrayed you ll find this film a lot more likeable i myself don t love it i think it s an overrated film its in roger ebert s the great movies but despite that it still weaves a spell on the viewer if you re watching it oddly enough for a movie in which almost nothing occurs it s almost hours long it s running time is about the movie is about a group of rich friends anna lea massari and her lover sandro gabriele ferzetti anna s friend claudia monica vitti and some others when they reach a small island anna and sandro have a little quarrel and soon anna has disappeared like picnic at hanging rock we will never see her again or find out what happened to her this film offers up a lot more theories than that film did but when anna is gone anna is gone antonioni teases us a bit by letting us almost see a boat leaving us to wonder if anna left on it anyway the group looks for anna and calls the coast guard eventually they give up and return to shore the rest of the film is more or less built on the foundation of the characters trying to find anna but the film is not a search for anna at all antonioni makes it very clear in the beginning of the film that anna is gone forever the plot if one can call it that has claudia and sandro becoming lovers they don t fall in love love seems to be nonexistent in this movie i won t say much more than that truth is there s not much more to say the final scene of the film is in my opinion simultaneously the most beautiful and haunting shot of the entire film to be honest this is a movie i ll probably have to see again i think most people will find that this film doesn t connect with the immediately and may never do so i actually liked it which gives me hope for future viewings that i may come to appreciate what everyone else saw as for now the casual commercial film viewer will not like this movie that i can damn near guarantee people who like film the criterion collection or antonioni will if you don t fall into either of these categories you might want to check it out and see what you think of it i ve said all i can grade b 
an incisive portrait of british establishment the loneliness of the long distance runner is a honest expresionist portrait of british working class director tony richardson developed a short story by alan sillitoe who collaborates as scripwriter in the film for what s probably the movie that synthesizes better than any other the subversive spirit of free cinema a cinematographic social phenomenon that joined a group of angry young men revolted against the narrow borders of a manipulative and hygienic industry interested in keeping under latch the miseries and contradictions of british establishment the film condenses wonderfully almost everything of the innovations and social worries that have converted free cinema in the most important experience of british cinematography the use of documentary film tecniques following the example of humphrey jannings movies and the documentary school of john grierson independent production antiestablisment criticism antiacademic performances the rebound of glamour and stylism the use of montage strategies inspired in political russian cinematographers and innovative technologies as portable cameras and the interest in reflecting underground social subjects colin smith tom courtenay is an intelligent and desillusioned teenager who has been sent to a reform school for youths from the low step of the british class pyramid due to a petty robbery in a bakery soon the reformatory governor michael redgrave obssesed in discipline and sports and in winning a cross country running competition against a local private school ingratiates with him once he has could evaluate colin s excellent background as long distance runner circumstance that supposes for him the favour of the reformatory governor and a excellent chance of getting a fast freedom during his privileged solitary runs outside the reformatory colin reminds his life just before his incarceration balancing his paradoxal situation in the following lines i describe what i think are three representative moments of the combative ideology of the film and the fresh spirit of free cinema the scene when the inmates revolts against their superiors in the reformatory s dinning room for which tony richardson uses wisely montage tecniques learned of vanguardist russian directors as eisenstein or dovzhenko the ironic portrait of the society of comfort where we see colin s family spending the money of the insurance in a succcession of vignettes preceded by advertising curtains and enclosed with a sardonic music and finally the brilliant parallel action montage where we see the inmates singing a patriotic song in the chapel of the reformatory while at the same moment in a looser cell of the building the inmate who had got to runaway days before is wildly punished another of the much achievements of this extraordinary film is the expressionist use of jazz music in the sequences of the solitary runs of colin outside the reformatory gates for when another free cinema 
terry gilliam s fumble this documentary follows terry gilliam s failed attempt to make a film based on cervantes novel don quixote the film follows the rising wave of disasters that culminate in the canceling of the film only weeks into production i think this documentary should be watched by all aspiring filmmakers who can see how bad things can get on a film shoot there was only one major problem with the film lack of personal conflict everyone who has taken part in a bad shoot knows the amount of back biting cover yourass and blame assignment behavior that occurs except for a few brief scenes we don t really see any of this whether the cast and crew were on their best behavior while on camera or the documentary filmmakers decided to censor this in editing these common scenes are noticeably absent one interesting opinion i reached while watching the film was that the st assistant director st ad almost certainly should have been fired for one the location scouting was horrendous anyone who has ever done location scouting knows that for such a major exterior shot daily noise pollution and environmental factors should have been checked first hand additionally when the extras didn t attend their weekend rehearsal making impossible a shot on the assigned day the st ad had no idea it strikes the viewer that terry gilliam likes the st ad and stood by him because the ad was as disorganized as the director it made me think of the classic line in spinal tap its not your job to be as confused as nigel is it all in all an excellent behind the scenes look at an attempt to make a film with a large scope dan rahmelauthor nuts and bolts filmmaking 
required but oh so enjoyable i was required to watch and write about this at first i thought booring wrong it captivates the audience and presents history in a fascinating way the passion that these two felt despite being an arranged marriage suprised me oh what a pair full of passion just like the movie 
lycanthropy landis style the werewolf sub genre is one that has suffered over the years from poverty row production values and destructive self mockery like the zombie the werewolf is the poor relation to the endless tales of vampirism and frankenstein this is mainly due to a lack of generic tradition in literature and art but hollywood has done little to redress the balance over the years however for a short time in the early s the werewolf enjoyed the fullest of moons with both joe dante s howling and john landis american werewolf in london thrilling audiences and winning important critical notices landis had scored with animal house and the blues brothers and deftly combines the ribald humour of those films with all the horror clichs that had undone universal s output in the s importantly landis s humour is not mocking instead he gives us an affectionate parody overflowing with enthusiasm he is also very aware of the conventions and limitations of the genre itself the scares and violence come in abundance as does the nonsensical narrative twists england is both beautiful and eerie a space in which the age old battle between science and superstition continues to be played out the film works because of its lack of originality through its post modern appropriation of universal s themes and iconography we have an early example of a horror homage wonderful special make up effects by rick baker however firmly anchors the film in modern horror seas full of excellent british character actors the nostalgia of the film is pitched perfectly and represents the high watermark of hollywood horror films for the suniversals disc dvd is misleading the supplementary features amount to little more than minutes and the dvd could have easily been presented on a single disc 
one of the best if you are an inxs fan this is a must have epecially since the videos on it were rarely seen on mtv epecially the video for quottaste it quot which was banned when you see it you will see why long live inxs rip michael hutchence you are missed dearl 
i love it but i can see why others would hate it this movie s really good it s arty scary gothic and to top it off bauhaus is in the begining it s a really depressing movie but that doesn t take away from anything it just makes you love the movie that much more but it s alittle hard to follow sometimes and the vampires don t really do anything cool they feed by cutting you with there cute little necklesses and then sucking on the wound but it still works there s mad chicks making out too i could see why some people would hate it though it s slow sometimes the artiness can be alittle much sometimes and it s really really depressing but if you re into that sort of thing this movie is perfect for you i loved it i stole it from hollywood video and am still collecting late fees 
bitterly funny indy film about love and lust this is a terrific little overlooked film worth watching with your mate especially if you re having problems ! themes of jealousy and lust and friendship are mined by a top rate ensemble cast tilly and stolz especially have a great believable chemistry and features standout cameos by parker posey and joey lauren adams obviously made on a shoestring budget this film dares to go to those uncomfortable places in relationships that we all experience but rarely see in films because of the big budget studio whitewashing worth a look or two 
incredibly moving i originally saw this imax movie in hawaii at the polynesian cultural center years ago and bought the soundtrack always hoping to get the dvd much to my amazement the movie was included for my pc as one of the features for windows xp anyway the music narration and footage is breathtaking i left the imax theatre feeling physically off balance because of the motion of the seas and the ocean and so moved by the magic of it all that i was teary eyed the rest of the day i ended up at sunset beach on oahu s north shore that evening watching the sunset and had the beach to myself it is one of those days that you will never forget in your lifetime it is still so vivid and watching this dvd brings every cell in me back to the living sea and the beaches of hawaii absolutely moving and breathtaking even when watching on the small screen vs the imax screen you will not be disappointed 
god s tender mercies excellent film wonderful acting outstanding script about grace and redemption one of my all time favorites 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods 
as good as an oscar nominee gets all right this is five stars by the special standards of hollywood one could project other expectations however i was both shaken and entertained when i saw the film first run and i remembered it well enough to buy it to show my teenage son a couple decades later is that recommendation enough 
u ll never look at your teacher the same way again i m still in high school nn all i can say is this movie definitely made me think twice before p ssn another one of my teachers off again 
the magnificent buster there s nothing i can add to what has already been said about these films themselves and how beautifully they showcase the genius of buster keaton his brilliance with stunt gags in oh and with cinematic tricks in sj i would like to comment on the music unlike a previous reviewer i find the added music score of sj mostly apt and a credit to the moods and tones of the film although there are moments when it draws too much attention to itself the music for oh though just doesn t work a great deal of it is ragtime for a film set in the s and it often doesn t match up at all with what s going on on screen an exception is the climactic waterfall sequence where the music is pretty good i have an old videotape of a great performances showing of our hospitality from the late s or early s with a magnificent orchestral score by carl davis i wish that version was available on dvd but it doesn t seem to be but at least these films do have orchestral scores and not piano or organ accompaniment which can work well enough in a theatrical showing if it s done well but which in general diminishes any film it s attached to 
big bird at his best i first saw this movie as a very young toddler and it soon became a favorite coming from a chinese household it was comforting and exciting to see a character like big bird whom i regarded as a friend visiting my mother s homeland i was devastated when i lost our recording several years ago so i was overjoyed to learn it is once again available even now as a teenager i am close to tears as i remember watching this video as a young child the joys it gave my mother and myself this movie is a must see for all children not simply because it offers a view of a foreign culture however i do not think that this video should be viewed as insight into chinese culture by showing this to adopted children it is not by any means teaching them to be chinese nonetheless i feel that the writers for this movie did an excellent job of portraying a glimpse of chinese culture to young children my mother and i found no inaccuracies in fact my mother joyfully reminisced as she saw big bird s girl companion playing traditional games that my mother played herself but please just view this video for what it is a fun entertaining children s movie i find it very hurtful to hear other people say that this movie is offensive in any way to the chinese people take it from someone who is actually chinese this movie is absolutely wonderful 
wonderful movie for children and adults regardless to what rubbish is usually written about this movie it is aimed at the younger audience and i can say with much assurance that it is a wonderful movie for my three year old son and my two year old nephews i have family that bring their children over and when they watch this movie they want copies of their own i don t think i ve ever heard a child complain about the animation or special effects of this movie kids just don t care what adults think about the shows they like they are interested in the entertainment value of it so this movie is wonderful and entertaining with a hint of some life lessons that we could all use 
better than th street i love this movie every year there is a hour marathon on the television of this film and my family and i watch it at least ten times it truly never gets old with us as the characters are authentic and full of good humor it is hysterically funny at times especially when the father receives the leg lamp in the mail and pronounces the word stamped on the box fragile as frageelay huh must be italian ralphie and his family make my family s holiday a lot brighter and we all look forward to watching this movie every year 
a classic this film is what many of today s filmsshould be great acting directingand story make this film one you canwatch over and over 
great performance i m not a big judy holliday fan she seems to have played the ditzy but smart squeaky voice role over and over this said born yesterday is easily her best movie the script is smart and sweet and she and william holden have a natural believable screen chemistry the performances are excellent as is the pygmalion like transformation of holliday s character from mouse to lionness a great comedy of manners and morality 
i liked drunks but i loved ! clean and sober i gave a dvd called drunks three stars and it earned each of them i just finished watching clean and sober and i am giving it five stars only because i am unable to give it fifty clean and sober was everything drunks was not ! clean and sober had a nice tight script that made you follow really close to keep up clean and sober taught me more than a few things about drunks and druggies the prices on drunks and clean and sober should be switched drunks is no where near good as clean and sober yet drunks cost s a bit more i would have gladly forked over times the price for clean and sober compared to the for drunks that was not worth its prenium price both are fine movies but clean and sober was just so much better clean and sober made me think clean and sober was an emotional roller coaster i started out hating the main character in the movie he started out a mean self absorbed trite nasty worthless no account of the first order as the dvd progressed to the middle point he was no better the supporting actors in the movie were awesome lending a sense of beleivability to the movie i liked everybody seemed to have mastered those seedy loathesome scamming natures druggies and drunks have when they are seconds away from hitting rock bottom slowly almost impreceptablyi started liking the main character i started thinking awe sweet he is going to hook up with his nice lady friend and then her beast of a boyfriend returns then she leaves her boyfriend s house supposedly to get a pack of smokes and i figured she was heading back to see the main character mushy ending lots of kissing and gurgling noises as the credits rolled i won t tell you what happened but i was wrong again big time the ending rather shocked me and by the time the credits rolled i was almost holding back tears vile thing was by the time the movie ended i honestly liked the title character i have never been a dope addict or alcoholic but i learned something from both drunks and clean and sober i learned you can t really help a dope addict because the help they need comes from within themselves once an alcohohic or druggie starts cleaning up their lives and picking up the peices i learned you can give people in recovery opportunities but only once they have shown the commitment needed to rebuild their lives the hardest thing in the world is to stand by and watch some one you love fall into drugs or booze knowing the only one who can pull them out of that early grave is themselves thats why i buy movies because i learn things better when i can see them play out in front of me this movie left me with a great joy and sorrow but the funniest thing is i only really remember the joy as clean and sober and drunks teach addicted people make their own choices and their ain t a damn thing all the love in the world can do about it this is one of my a list movies one last funny thing i almost did not buy this movie i only ended up buying it because i needed like bucks to hit the minimum required to get free super saver shipping so i tossed it in after seeing it i can not imagine my huge dvd collection without clean and sober in it clean and sober i think is a must have dvd 
liar liar this movie is great whoever have not seen it should definately check it out the funniest movie i have seen in years 
favorite episode it was one of my favorite episodes a way to get buffy and angel together without changing the storyline and the characters where able to express how they felt to each other 
good as gold how to steal a million was a light hearted farce starring too skilled performers in their own right audrey hepburn is delightful as the sweetheart bedazzled by peter o toole an expert in forged art works the two have you rooting for them in their improbable caper once you remind yourself that this is all just healthy fun than you can enjoy their performances greed becomes almost a worthy attribute as they endeavor to outwit the perfect security system guarding unknowingly a fake artwork it is all good fun as the security system is foiled without harming a hair on anyone s head dishonesty doesn t enter your mind as the caper comes to a pleasant climax everyone ends up with their reputation intact and some spare change jingling in their pockets the two stars are engaging and carefree and are so effortless in their actions that they are a joy to watch mind candy doesn t necessarily have to rot your brain it can give you some mindless enjoyment on a quiet night

election election sounds like a good movie and i am looking forward to seeing it rated r for strong sexualtly sexrelated dialague and language and a scene of drug use canadaawarningnot for children 
absolutely hilarious but you ll either love it or hate it when i first saw this movie on the shelf at the local video store i had quite a bit of trepidation and yet i rented it now i own the dvd and i can t count the number of times i ve seen it no it s not an original concept and no it s not animal house i don t think they re really trying to be another animal house though even if they give quite a few nods to that movie what this movie is is something light and comedic that you can sit back and enjoy the comedy is crude at times but well done from the play on relationships to a dildo fencing match as i said you ll either love it or hate it if you re the type of person who has to think about any movie you see you should probably move on to a movie that takes itself more seriously because this one does nothing of the sort if you re looking for animal house try searching under animal house just a suggestion beyond the mere comedy of the movie they do actually have some messages hidden underneath and we re not talking boxers or briefs it s a common theme about gender perceptions peer pressure and self esteem so maybe there s something to think about after all 
what a shame firefly is imaginative exiting and heartfelt it is simply the best sci fi no scratch that the best tv i ve scene scince the x files the acting is very good the stoyline is compeling and by the last episode i felt like i was part of the crew i cant believe they pulled it before they even had a chance does that remind you of anything so here we are stuck with law and order svcipu and the so called reality garb when we could be watching something truly original what happened to tv that makes us think dont get me wrong but saving lives and putting away pervs is all good but its all the same ! where is capt kirk where is moulder where is river science fiction does nt mean out of this world firefly really hits home and holds a message for all of us right here in the st century watch the first episode and you ll be hooked i was

beverly hills cop ii axel foley eddie murphy is back in the hit sequel beverly hills cop many times sequels to original blockbuster films are sucky there even more sucky when the sequel is done by a different director tony scott than the original film martin brest but in this case that s not the case beverly hills cop is amazingly good it s funny has a good script has action and suspense the story in this film is that axel s buddy and friend former chief andrew bogomil ronny cox has been shot and left for dead by a crazy lunatic arms dealer named karly fry brilliant done by brigitte nielsen axel back in detroit heads to beverly hills to see his friend and to aid his fellow friends billy rosewood judge reinhold and john taggart john ashton in getting justice for his friend however a new police chief harold lutz allen garfield a small man with lots of power plans to derail their investigation while at the same kissing the butt of the mayor robert ridgely to further his career and reputation like i said beverly hills cop has alot of action there are gun fights car chases and everything found in a good action flick however i also liked the fact that all the characters were back in the film and that all of them were as close as ever billy rosewood the nice and anal friend of taggart has become a wannabee rambo type guy collecting guns and weapons leading to taggart telling him that we need to talk lolhowever billy and taggart in the last film do become helpful in helping axel along with giving us a couple of good laughs axel eddie murphy is again at his comical best doing everything legal and illegal to find out whose behind his friend s shooting and bringing them down hard all in all beverly hills cop is a great sequel to the original many of the cool music tunes are back along with a couple of new ones plus the film manages to recreate the hysterical laughs from the first film and adds alot of action there has actually been games made of beverly hills cop one for the pc and one for the commodore

controversial classic that s more than historically interesting melville farr dirk bogarde a married and highly respected barrister on the verge of making qc becomes embroiled in a homosexual blackmail plot when a youth he befriended is arrested and commits suicide as farr attempts to track down and expose the blackmailers much to the distress of his secretly gay acquaintances and colleagues farr and his wife are forced to confront his own ambiguous sexuality i hunted this film down because it came up time and again in reviews and discussions about brokeback mountain and i wanted to see what all the fuss was about it was apparently a pivotal moment in the history of british cinema being the first movie to use the word homosexual let alone pitch an argument against britain s anti sodomy laws that s all a bit irrelevant almost comical these days and certainly no reason to bother watching this unless you re particularly interested in film history what struck me however and what prompts me to recommend this film is the way it still stands up as a dramatic thriller even today it s beautifully paced finely crafted in terms of shooting and editing and the writing is marvellously fresh it feels almost contemporary the way the opening thirty minutes unfold are a short course in screenwriting just enough information is revealed to keep you engaged while enough is held back to make it intriguing for the duration it remains true to the demands of a mystery plot never becoming just a social essay it almost completely resists the urge to preach to the audience notwithstanding the controversial topic my only reservation is around the ending laura s final decision strikes me as both too needy and too generous to be quite credible but overall this is an excellent film 
fort apache it exceeds the searchers this is the gem of the wayne ford calvary trilogy and i am delighted it s finally coming to dvd but a question can anyone heal me of the following misjudgment try as i may i cannot shake off my estimation of fort apache as a more complete and substantially higher overall cinematic accomplishment in comparison with the searchers partly it may consist in the fact that the searchers is a great movie to watch and watch again but fort apache somehow succeeds as a more nearly perfect complete and wholly rounded experience the searchers shines due to its externals but apache proceeds and then later culminates in a richer deeper and more satisfying way and the whole movie experience resonates with you in a way that the searchers does not quite achieve 
see the exodus in this film i saw the exodus in this film like the hebrews they left the land and wandered to the place in fivers mind where they would be safe and happy similar to caanan the promised land of the hebrews when they got there they were overjoyed like the hebrews then they found trouble from the existing inhabitants as the hebrews also found in the inhabitants of caanan the film is a timeless masterpiece with a music score to match by the wonderful angela morley who composed part of the star wars score for john williams by george mc clo 
good i saw this in an extension film class at uci and james gray talked to the class after it was shown this being a dark movie it was slightly surprising that he was very light hearted and witty and good humored i thought the movie first rate it is intelligent and well written and well directed the only flaw i found in it is there is a scene where a bullet is shot through a hanging sheet the camera pans to the hole in the sheet to show the dead body on the other side well for the hole to accomodate the camera it had to be as wide as a hole a baseball would go through a bullet would never make a hole that big ! so that marred the movie slightly but other than that i liked it a lot it is dark and a lot of people in the class didn t like it because of that but if you like dark check this out 
love it i never tire of xanadu xanadu i love this movie not only is michael beck beyond hot but olivia newton john is a delight to watch and hear as well the soundtrack is infectious as is the movie itself gene kelly is an added bonus even at his age he can still dance as effortlessly as if it were singin in the rain the production numbers are so over the top that it gives the movie camp and cheese appeal and it s just plain ole fun the chemistry between beck and newton john is great is it silly yes but it s a gem i watch it at least times a year and never get tired of it actually it becomes more endearing i rank it in my top musicals of all time 
a diamond in the rough spoilers ahead ! ashes and diamonds begins on the day when world war ii ended for poland a day which brought with it celebration but also uncertainty the war has ended and things are still viscous but like molten rock this state is temporary enter the charismatic carefree maciek and the serious andrzej two polish exiles who joined the resistance in when they were fighting the germans for a free poland with the war over and the russians invading their country this was not the victory they imagined and so they lay beside a country church basking in the sunlit clarity of a warm beautiful day waiting for the arrival of a local communist party chairman so they can fill him full of lead and then head for their next assignment but things are not clear at all and in maciek s obvious enthusiasm for his job he executes two innocent men though he will not learn of his error until later in the hours period during which this film takes place by that time the clear sky will turn dark with rain and maciek s resolve to finish the job will be severely weakened by the beautiful barmaid krystyna who awakens within him a dormant faith in humanity and the possibility of love and happiness ashes and diamonds is a film that constantly paces back and forth between differing visions of a post wwii poland not surprising since director wajda had to walk a fine line between his fellow poles and the soviet censors most of the film takes place in darkness and the characters like the film itself pace back and forth struggling with an existential anguish that is almost crushing the enormous weight of responsibility when life becomes more than simply surviving the decision to act or not to act both have far reaching consequences the films emotional core takes place during a masterfully shot scene in a hotel room with both maciek and krystnya emotionally and physically naked cinematographer jerzy wojcik who graces this film with many unforgettable images gives us still another and with muted lense dissolves one lovers face into another interchangeably to suggest a coming together of souls once carefully measured exteriors are being melted by buried emotion like the way lava changes the face of a mountain dont touch me remarks krystnya during a particularly tender moment but these words are said not as a threat but as a last gasp defensive measure i don t want any good byes or memories to leave behind soon the two lovers will sneak out into the night god life can be so beautiful sometimes says maciek with enthusiasm just prior to a downpour that will have them scurring into the shelter of the burned out ash filed ruins of a church with jesus on a crucifix hanging upside down above the ruble it is here that krystnya reads an inscription from the polish poet cyprian kamil norwid which will spur the dormant revolutionary within maciek into action from you as from burning chips of resinfiery fragments circle far and near ablaze you don t know if you are to be free or if all that is yours will disappear will only ashes remain and confusionwhirling into the void or will there shineamidst the ash a starlight diamond the dawning of eternal victory 
i forgot to tell you if you catch any squirrels give them to me written by joseph minion after hours vampire s kiss and directed by barry shils wigstock the movie motorama stars jordan christopher michael full house the favor as gus a ten year old boy from a dysfunctional family who decides one day to take it on the road also appearing is a great many semi recognizable names and or faces including dick miller piranha jack nance twin peaks robert picardo star trek voyager flea the blue iguana mary woronov night of the comet garrett morris saturday night live michael j pollard roxanne john diehl stargate martha quinn chopper chicks in zombietown sandy jack klompus baron seinfeld vince edwards ben casey meat loaf fight club charles tyner the longest yard irwin keyes house of corpses susan tyrrell crybaby shelley berman meet the fockers and drew barrymore scream who is featured prominently on the dvd cover but appears for all of about ten seconds in the film as i mentioned earlier jordan christopher michael plays gus a ten year old boy who fed up with this messed up family decides to hit the road by stealing a cherry late model mustang now i should probably mention the film which appears to be set in the american southwest actually takes place in a sort of alternate type reality where the states have different names than those we might expect for example the landscape featured may lead one to believe we re in arizona but within the film a sign might say we re in the state of essex anyway along the way gus starts participating in a game called motorama sponsored by a gas station chain the game involves cards that are given to customers after purchasing at least five dollars of gas as participants collect cards they remove the affixed sticker hopefully to reveal a letter the idea being to collect all the letters to spell out the word motorama and win the grand prize which is million dollars as gus travels from filling station to filling station always buying only five dollars worth of gas he comes across all kinds of bizarre individuals including a pious gas station attendant diehl a motel operator nance who has an unusual prejudice towards squirrels a psychotic simple minded busboy flea a vindictive security systems designer baron and so on as gus collects more and more cards the game becomes somewhat of an obsession one that begins to take its toll both physically and mentally gus seems to be aging fairly rapidly eventually his travels lead gus to a virtual no man s land a nightmarish state marked by an over industrialized landscape oil refineries and what not and a plethora of individuals even more bizarre that previously experienced all in search of the final card he needs to win the game or so he thinks as always be sure to read the fine print if what i ve written doesn t make a whole lot of sense then you should try watching this film i suppose there s a message or two that emerges by the end but after about ten minutes in i stopped trying to comprehend of much of what happened as the story doesn t seem to be written to accommodate viewers expecting a straightforward tale by the way on the surface this may appear to be a film geared towards children but that s certainly not the case as there is some violence profanity and even a bit of nekkidness all of which contributed to the movie s r rating there are some comedic bits throughout but many of these seem to include a dark element one scene in particular features gus in need of funds stopping at a roadside rest stop and challenging a family man played by dick miller to a game of horseshoes for money miller s character loses and has to pay up forcing him to pull a hansel and gretel routine on his two small children seems he can afford to support his entire clan the rest of their journey this is the tone of much of the humor so if it doesn t sound appealing then you d best skip this film altogether i m unsure if i was supposed to like the character of gus as throughout the film he s portrayed as not only a criminal stealing a car motorama cards and siphoning gas but he also appeared a somewhat smarmy smart mouthed patronizing punk in need of a beating which he does receive more than once but then again it s not like i related to any of the grownups in the movie so whatever i mentioned earlier a number of performers appearing in the film but one should known most of these performances are brief as jordan christopher michael is the only person we spend any meaningful amount of time with he seems like a decent actor but with this type of material it seemed to me one could act any number of ways and still have the film come off relatively the same that being an eccentric road trip into the land of the mondo there was one aspect i found annoying even after i stopped trying to make sense of things and that was the near the end when things come full circle in a manner of speaking at times it seemed the film was being weird just for the sake of being weird which i dislike but other times there seemed some genuineness so i m willing to give the movie the benefit of the doubt all in all this is a real curiosity piece one that probably won t appeal to most audiences the picture format on this columbia tristar dvd release seems something of an oddity to me as it is presented in fullscreen anamorphic that s right i said fullscreen anamorphic what the hell is the point seems to me those interested in only the fullscreen format would care less if the picture was anamorphic and those interested in the anamorphic aspect would be looking for the original aspect ratio as presented theatrically either way it is kind of a shame as there are tons of scenic desert vista shots that would have come across much better in the original widescreen format the picture itself comes across clean and the dolby surround audio comes through well enough with subtitles available in english french spanish portuguese chinese korean and thai as far as extras there s squat unless you count a trailer for the david spade film the adventures of joe dirt which i don tcookiemanby the way andy summers former member of the band the police supplied the original music for this film some of it s good but there was a repetitive quality that got on my nerves a little 
a triumphant comeback for kurosawa the mortally wounded lord shingen tatsuya nakadai engaged in strife with two opposing warlords for control of feudal japan commands that his death be kept a secret for three years in order to prevent both disarray among his clan and conquest by his enemies upon his death his kagemusha or double nakadai again a lowly thief with a startling resemblance to the lord takes over under the strict supervision of shingen s closest associates this visually striking film explores the extent to which a person s identity is constructed by others the double begins to impress those around him as he seems to grow into the role even winning the devotion of shingen s grandson the man and his social position become blurred until it becomes unclear which is the real person when the double is unceremoniously humiliated and ejected from the palace toward the end i could almost imagine that the rage of those who pelted him with stones was also repressed anger against the real lord shingen when the double witnesses the tragic fate of the takeda clan at the end of the film it is as if the ghost of shingen himself has appeared to witness the end of all his dreams a powerful thought provoking and moving film 
a very powerful treatment of popularity viz a viz discipline in the military in an interview sir alec guinness was asked how difficult it was for him to portray an individual whom he in actual life was the opposite to sir alec responded as all great actors would by saying that he felt it to be challenging but enjoyed it once he got into it and this is the alec guinness that one sees in tunes of glory the tale of friction between two powerful figures both with huge egos and both unwilling to bend to the circumstances of reality and their times the ending of the movie has always broken me up and brought me to tears for just as in the movie all my sons themajor guiness felt an afffinity and a kinship to all the men under him growing to love them as all my babies he would his own sons there lies the irony in the ending and his ultimate feelings for col barrow john mills enuff sai 
a strange and quirky dark comedy first of all motorama is not for everyone most people view the film negatively and that s all right because the film isn t for everyone is it a masterpiece of comedy no is the acting terrific no is there a plot no and that s fine with me once in awhile i like these quirky little comedies ie the vagrant comes to mind this strange surrealistic and dark comedy stars young ten yearold gus jordan christopher michael and he s about to rev up the engine of his dad s mustang and take off on one hell of a journey gus is trying to win a game motorama if you collect all of the letters to the game a million dollar cash prize awaits you problem is everybody gave up on the game long ago since no one ever won the money plus many of the gas stations no longer carry the letters and no one ie adults are even playing the game anymore but gus is one obsessed juvenile in quest of that one missing and elusive letter will he find it well that s the point of the game no one was ever supposed to find that one missing letter of the alphabet but gus does therefore he s rich right wrong the company that set the game up devised a way in which no one could ever possibly win and they did this by placing the winning letter in an out oftheway run down gas station at the edge of some surrealistic and strange borderland in god knows where now gus is driving throughout the southwest in his quest for the winning letter and along the way he meets all sorts of mean and eccentric people moreover he goes through all sorts of cruel and physical tortures from the various denizens he meets along the way this comedy is very strange and very quirky as i wrote in the beginning it is not for everyone but there is something about the film i found fascinating while watching it years ago it is just so very strange that i couldn t help not liking the film yes the script writing is flawed and the acting is not too great so what i don t need a casablanca all the time a strange and quirky film will do just fine once in awhile i recommend renting the film just to see if you like it 
i attended mission i attended morehouse college allboys hbcu in took classes at spelman allgirls hbcu and i saw the same issues years after school daze was released in fact i m positive lee a morehouse alum combined the two schools to create mission college sans the musical interludes this movie is so realistic and the message is so powerful if you haven t seen this movie go see it today you won t be sorry 
the nd best cannibal film this is the second best most disturbing film next to cannibal holocaust which will always be the champion but thats not taking anything away from cannibal ferox which was banned in countires and contains some of the most brutal scenes ever filmed see this film it wont dissapoint 
i so loved this movie so much this movie is so comforting to me its sweet funny and def gives you a message no matter how green the grass may seem a man that has a lot on his plate kevin bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman it s not always moral of the story is you need to go with your heart he realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his single self i absolutely love this movie love the music love the actors love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby too funny ! 
the crow of diamonds another bert i gordon masterpiece the beginning of the end features a wooden peter graves waxing philosophic about the effects of radiation on locusts not grasshoppers which have grown to varying sizes and are maurauding through an oddly mountainous illinois dispatching of entire towns graves is accompanied by a plucky female journalist and briefly a deaf mute gardening assistant add in half hearted special effects shot after shot of locusts crawling up postcards of buildings and some leery directing an opening car sequence that takes forever to end a lascivious locust staring into an apartment at a freshly showered woman in a towl and you ve got your typical d grade schlock this is one of the first episodes from the mike nelson season the back of the dvd box features joel s friendly mug don t be fooled and as such there is some hesitancy in the jokes some ground feeling the opening host segment where mike receives a bizarre phone call from a trailer trash mom who thinks he s someone else sets a great tone for the show as does the invention exchange the recomfybike and new playing cards but the movie is such a dud that the riffs are often repetitive and rare the host segments inject a bit of life into the dullness one of them though a deliberately non funny stand up routine by tom is so deliberately non funny that it well it really isn t funny mirroring in a sad way the status of the entire film the joke of the show hinges on movies that are so bad they re funny but every once in a while the mstk crew finds a movie that s so bad it s well it s nothing but bad the beginning of the end comes close to that after all there are only so many jokes that can be made about long ponderous silences and recycled dialogue scenes mike and the bots do the best they can here but the end result is just so so for die hard collectors only 
dog soldiers i surprisingly enjoyed this movie it is a little choppy and hard to understand what is going on at first but it is well worth the watch especially if you are a werewolf movie fan 
star trek at its best shore leave is one of the best episodesof the classic series it uses all thesci fi props but also has a great story if you don t even care about star trekand have to watch one watch this one 
sleeper this is an australian western written by nick cave and as such is predictably bleak and revisionist with a decidedly skeptical view toward authority and the brutal efforts required to tame a land it has a truly extraordinary cast and all of the leads do fantastic work particularly the ever reliable ray winstone and guy pearce although there are a few overwrought sequences and missteps along the way this is overall quality stuff and is heartily recommended even if you are a bit burned out on the genre the australian setting lends it a certain novelty and gives it a different feel as some have commented it is a bit more graphically violent than your typical western but i think the violence is spread out and narratively motivated in ways that don t make it seem gratuitous so don t let that keep you from trying this one out 
a great read for critical thinkers of the christian faith this book is a great tool for critical thinkers of the christian faith ravi zacharias delivers a compelling although often wordy description of how pluralism has degraded and made a mockery of absolute truth 
john grisham s novel brought to live by a stellar cast and preformances this is one of my favorite movies besides containing a stellar cast matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock sammuel l jackson oliver platt donald and keifer sutherland kevin spacey you get the idea is there a cast member that isn t a biggie the casting is genious and the acting incredible it s suspenseful deep very emotional slightly dark it s the perfect movie even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you a time to kill s plot is pretty simply explained in the deep south a year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks who almost kill her a young white lawyer and father matthew mcconaughey as jake brigance is sickened at the news and doesn t quite know what to think when the little girl s father sammuel l jackson as carl lee hailey pays him a visit and asks if he d help him if he were in a tight spot the next day as the two redneck monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment carl lee hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher jake brigance agrees to defend hailey as his murder trial begins the insanity plea is used to give the jury an excuse to aquit but in my opinion i think it was quite legitimate what father wouldn t be driven insane under the circumstances the rest of the movie is carl lee hailey s trial and the surrounding drama as kkk violence emerges led by kiefer sutherland and jake s life and home are in danger his relationship with his wife strained and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle my favorite scene it might come as a surprise but my favorite scene is when the prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial he was caught in the knee by a stray bullet and now has half a leg after the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against carl lee and establish unerring identity of the shooter the defence asks him two questions do you think carl lee intentionally shot you nodo you think he should be sent to prision for what he did he did what i would have done but it doesn t end there as the policeman remember he s missing a leg because of what carl lee hailey did becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like carl lee did he starts screaming to the jury to turn him loose he s a hero i think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes albeit there are many others too great acting by chris cooper as the policeman anyway forgive if i rambled i love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas star studded casts john grisham suspense thrillers just all around good movies you need to see this 
good kid movie my son loves these hot wheels movies he s i think this first one started off with a good story and has plenty of action there are lessons on what s important in life and looking out for each other we rented this so much at the movie store that we finally just decided to buy it 
pure awesome this movie was awesome on every level it had a great cast great story and great effects the transfer and sound on this dvd is top notch as well if you enjoy old monster movies you ll love the black scorpion 
so touching i have to confess that i went to tears watching this movie and usually i don t get emotional easily it s so touching a phd professor of middle age find out that she is sick ovarian cancer it was a shock for her the doctor is talking to her and she can barely react all through the movie she looks at the camera from time to time and tell us all what she is thinking and suffering there is a brilliant young doctor yes one of those who always wants to be the first and the best no matter what with a big ego the big shot of the class who was her student in one of her literature classes it made me very angry his attitude because he was treating her in a very cold and selfish way only thinking in the results of the research i want to say that most of the doctors and scientists are not that way but once in a while you can find one of these weird specimen the nurse was nice and treated her in a better way this kind of movie makes us think about the fact that we are all just humans not matter the title or knowledge you can have and we are here to help each other no taking advantadge of each other i strongly recommend this movie just be sure to have a box of facial tissues near you 
horizon this has always been for me the definitive zenda film with a great cast of actors great adventure story and an ill fated romance what more could one ask 
ping pong match phil hartman is one of snl s best and this dvd does a fair job of capturing his talent but like most of these recent snl dvd releases it is definitely lacking if you re a big hartman fan you should buy this but if you re looking for a dvd packed with non stop laughs you may be disappointed this one starts out strong but dwindles in comedic value by the end the extras are ok at best although i did really enjoy the audition extra which again if you re a huge hartman fan you ll definitely want to see overall there s nothing wrong with this dvd i had just hoped for more going into it it would be a definite buy for less than 
claudine nyc the s somewhat light hearted drama about a struggling inner city single mother who meets a charming sanitation worker the many bumps they hit in the road to further their relationship great performances by diahann carroll james earl jones also the young actors portraying her children were quite convincing the one obvious flaw to me however was that although an accomplished seasoned actress ms carroll isn t quite convincing as a true inner city resident someone like cicily tyson or esther rolle would ve pulled it off more convincingly ms carroll has just too much of a glamorous charisma for it this movie can appeal to many but i d think mostly for people who grew up in the s in the city like myself they re likely to relate more to the characters 
death is not necessarily the end of life this was on sky movies only the other day i had seen it when it first came out in the early s and you d expect it to be somewhat dated but even after over years since it was made this movie still manages to pack a wallop the very under rated ellen burstyn plays edna mccauley a young woman tragically widowed in a car accident that leaves her in a wheelchair in her grief she returns home to the family farm to her wonderfully warm and loving grandmother and her cold and distant father who has never been able to tell his only daughter he loves her edna isn t aware of it in the beginning but having a near death experience in the accident that left her a widow she now has healing powers which she uses first on a child who has horrific nose bleeds and then on herself so that she can walk again but edna is aware her gift is special her grandmother worldly and quietly religious tells her granddaughter to her gift for the good of others which edna does but there are people who are jealous of what she can do especially a self proclaimed preacher by the name of earl his son cal a very young sam shepherd becomes edna s lover but he becomes afraid of her gift his fear is born out of his harsh zealot upbringing at the hands of a man who believes that the bible is the be all and end all and that edna is not doing god s work but the work of the devil resurrection could have fallen flat on its face as the subject matter it is dealing with is complex and controversial but the director the late daniel petrie manages to make it both satisfying and uplifting without ever heading for the sentimental avenue which films like this can often end up the end scene is wonderful with edna quietly living out her life running a gas station on a lonely route surrounded by animals enjoying her solitude but occasionally gifting to other her healing skills but in such a way they never know an absolute gem of a film 
offbeat s movie that still has charm vibes only lasted a few weeks at the box office before critics tore it to shreds no one at the time thought a movie starring singer cindy lauper could be any good despite what the critics thought cindy held her own jeff goldblum and cindy as well as every other actor really make this film enjoyable to watch despite its age jeff and cindy are psychics hired by a charming as ever peter faulk to use their abilities to find a lost inca city before another group of baddies do the city however is not exactly what everyone thinks it is i dont know why its not on dvd but it should be yes its campy and very s but the actors make it believable and actually a joy to watch a definite lazy sunday afternoon movie 
a missing baby new year and no santa this is a must for anyone having young children children of all ages should enjoy this cartoon for the christmas season children always like to watch any cartoon about santa and rudolph not only are you getting one but three christmas cartoon classics i may be an adult but i still like watching these classics myself 
amazing hilarious troubling frightening some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and too slow i m not a film maker and cannot comment on that other than to say that they are wrong the film is amazing i m not sure if there is any other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller cumdictatorcumstatesman is like nowadays people might not know who idi amin is or what he did so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie he plays accordian you see him meeting with his advisors some of whom disappear so after you see him play acting like a grown up boy with toy soldiers you see his self appointed royal pedigree and send his support for nixon ! its fascinating and amazing this is man that self proclaimed actually ate some of his rivals not the whole body i hope he killed many people directly and by his policies his ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie apparently there is a new movies coming out about idi amin starring forrest whitaker he s a good actor and so i look forward to seeing it but this is the real guy its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again

a great mountain man movie jeremiah johnson is perhaps the best of the mountain man movies of the s and remains a highly enjoyable movie the grandeur of the mountain scenery wildlife and overall setting and look of the movie are fantastic as a matter of fact the movie was filmed entirely in utah and the wasatch and uinta mountain locations are just as spectacular seen in person today as they are in the movie those who find this movie enjoyable will undoubtably want to read the vardis fisher book mountain man as well as any of terry c johnston s books featuring protagonist titus bass carry the wind oneeyed dream etc those who like this movie may also want to see windwalker which is available on vhs and dvd 
it s no forrest gump but just as realistic hey if your not too caught up in the original dumb dumber andthe we can t laugh unless we re having our brains then youuuuuu might like it not a box of chocolates 
another great slater film having seen parts of this film over a span of the last decade or so without fully seeing all of it i noticed this dvd on sale at a huge retailer rhymes with ball mart for only i couldn t resist picking it up to see it all finally was it worth it yes i am a straight married guy and a huge fan of christan slater i have seen damn near every movie with him in it and pump was another classic did i love everything about this movie no it definately reeks of late s references and inuendo i e bill and ted clones the story was very well done however it contains major flaws i am a cop and i know for a fact the federal government would not send the fcc after a lone pirate station who is not screaming for the downfall of government but is ranting about the local high school administration i didn t like the ending i won t spoil it for you but just say it could have been better overall it was a out of not bad for a film from 
touching funny and thought provoking the ringer succeeds in moving well though being laugh out loud funny touching and thought provoking viewers who look for the ringer to be simple slapstick or to allow them guilty laughs in the name of political incorrectness will miss the entire point of the film the farrelly brothers do an excellent job of presenting a story that challenges deeply held stereotypes and entertains at the same time highly recommended and hats off to the filmmakers 
branded if you enjoy good ol westerns this is one of the most entertaining good story one of alan lad s best westerns 
awesome chicks if you are a dixie chicks fan you will find no better musical experience the music vocalsfans and emotions are unbeatable also i couldnt help but notice every female in the crowd were gorgeous 
bruce vs the wretched serial killer bruce willis would not be the first actor to bag on their own work some people might take the fact that an actor bags on their own work as a very authoritative statement and not bother seeing such a film if the actor doesn t like their own film why should anyone else bother but i think such need not always be the case and this movie is one good example and artist is always critical of their own work and rightly so but just because they see things they don t like about their own work or something else about a film they are in does not mean that others will certainly see the same things for the same reasons after seeing a trailer for this movie on a dvd i have i came upon an imdb post about a bob costas tv interview ive never seen it myself and bruce willis saying he knew this movie was crap when he was making it and that this experience made him decide to choose projects based on the projects merits and avoid hollywood tripe for this and other reasons i did not bother to pursue getting the movie at the time recently i came across this movie in a wal mart discount bin and being a bruce willis fan i grabbed it after watching it i find it easy to say that even though i don t care much for movies involving serial killers this was a decent enough flick that would have been worth it had i paid instead it could be defined as typical hollywood tripe especially if you re an actor who s been in the business for years and are looking to expand your horizons but not all tripe is truly tripe bruce did a decent enough job going up against the killer and the movie was not just tired and boring and by the numbers it looks and sounds good has good production values and cinematography is fairly suspenseful and entertaining in the big picture it s probably fairly typical of this type of movie but if you want to see bruce willis go through the paces in the taking down the serial killer routine it s a decent and interesting take on it all and without a lot of in your face gore or anything incidentally i and plenty of others think that hudson hawk rocks ! some people just don t get it i suppose 
fragments of a life without story or plot i m not sure that what is most unique and remarkable about bresson is his spiritual style as it is often described one might say that by showing life in all its harshness his work opens the viewer to a vision of its fallen state and to the way in which a kind of grace is exhibited in the stubborn refusal of his central characters to cave in to the ways of the world even in the face of harsh adversity even here mouchette s final seemingly tragic act is shown to be in many ways a joyous one the work of a child at play whose counterpart in the film is the exuberant bumper car ride where she laughs and flirts even as she is jolted and tossled about by the shock of being continuously smashed by other cars still what seems most distinctive about his films is not so much the subject matter as the deliberate lack of pretense in its style which amounts almost to a kind of refusal to let himself as filmmaker or storytelling conventions intrude on the blunt portrayal of life while you can certainly reconstruct the events portrayed in this film in terms of a standard plot structure bresson seems unwilling to plot out the story of mouchette in an interview contained on this dvd he says to a reporter that if he could sum up what happens to mouchette it would be absurd to make a movie of it he aims only to give the essentials showing no more than what is absolutely necessary with the implication that as viewers we feel as though the world we are shown piecemeal is much bigger and more complete than what we are permitted to see it is not so much mouchettes story that we are allowed to see as mouchettes world a small world with a few recognizable places and recognizable routines a few places she is permitted to go by a domineering father and by a mother and brother whose needs place great but uncoerced demands upon her and a few places she goes on her own in acts of deliberate defiance and at the same time acts of seeking someone who will not judge her or use her or place demands upon her because it feels like the world we enter with bresson s films is not merely a story that is being told even when as in this case it happens to be adapted from a story that had been written down by georges bernanos it is something that endures something that remains with the viewer at least this one long after the final image has faded in all of his films but this one feels unique and special in this respect bresson achieves something more than merely fiction this is not an enjoyable filmgoing experience and his aim is neither to uplift or to provide a message or entertain but simply to show this film is entertaining and surprising in its own way but in the sense that it is an endless source of surprise and wonder when bresson refuses to employ cliches of any sort and yet manages to make the events he portrays directly intelligible without any hint of manipulation of audience emotions or expectations not to be missed by anyone who is interested in the potentials of film or in the artistic recreation of life in both its everyday and its tragic dimensions 
my favorite hartley film if you like trust and simple men then you ll love this film personally i love all of hartley s works but to me these three films just go so well together they re all earlier works and in these films you witness an incredibley inspired director do more with a low budget film than most high paid directors could ever dream of doing i d also like to say that if you ve never seen a hal hartley film then this is probably the best point to start out at

excellent movie not a big box office success this is really a very good movie great performances from michelle pfeiffer colin firth jessica lange and jason robards 
kiefer sutherland keeps control of quotground control quot i m not a ground controller so i won t even try to analyze the technical aspects of this movie i fully admit that i purchased quotground control quot mainly because kiefer sutherland is the star and i love his acting even in movies that aren t the quotbestquot kiefer always delivers a fine performance and quotground control quot is no exception i could list some negatives about the movie such as the inclusion of kristy swanson in the cast this woman adds nothing to the plot and isn t the least bit convincing except when it becomes obvious that she has her eye on jack kieferand follows him around even during what should be private moments for him nothing personal against kristy but most of her contribution could have ended up on the cutting room floor and it would have been no loss kiefer sutherland however proves again what a versatile actor he is as the tormented jack harris a top notch ground controller who years later still feels responsible for a crash that was not his fault now as a favor to his friend jack comes to lend a hand at phoenix ground control and soon finds himself in an all too familiar situation this movie would fall apart if kiefer sutherland had not been in the role of jack harris this is kiefer s movie all the way and every facial expression and word and action is totally kiefer he had me thoroughly convinced of what jack harris had gone through and was still going through i actually learned a lot from this movie i learned that being a ground controller is not a cushy job and the controllers who keep thousands of planes safe every day are more often than not overworked and in danger of burnout but they keep going i know i couldn t be that dedicated this is not a job i could handle i give quotground control quot high marks sure it may not fit the definition of quotaward winning quot but kiefer sutherland plows through the weaknesses of the film and he simply makes it work 
greatest injustice since sacco and vanzetti the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders the answer presented by material in the film is an unflinching no there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three the film s strengths are that it doesn t preach at least not in an overly wrought narrative and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims i can understand the pain and confusion of the victim s families what is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them the victims families are the most terrifying aspect of this film at one point the mother of the byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone i hate them i hate them and the mother s that bore them is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child no quite natural really but the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started i imagine the bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in i ll have to ask brad pitt what he thinks about it some time on the issue of the prosecution they had next to nothing a very questionable confession from a terrified kid jessie with a iq hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard damien bragging about the murder but have no proof a knife found behind damien s house which doesn t match the wounds on the bodies and the assertion that because damien read about wicca he must be a satanist to look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film jessie a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world his iq is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low iq damien is the key to everything in this film though the defense made the key mistake of letting damien take the stand for two reasons the first reason is that damien appears to have add and after the first minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no s the second reason and the most important is that damien is obviously extremely bright normally this wouldn t seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world damien scared them all of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other more sinister and shocking suspects that needed to be pursued the war rages on for the west memphis three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it and terrifying to think they didn t

its almost christmas time for a cowboy movie it s a good one too it s a remake better than it s predecessor from which looks old despite a fine performance by walter brennan as one of the bandits gus this version of the three godfathers is old also made it but it is a typical wayne john ford colaboration which makes it fresh alive it is not the slower ponderous dark version of that older movie is not bad it is just not quite as good there are somedifferences ford s movie has no killing the bandits die of course the mother dies in child birth the version is an all around meaner version as a bandit is shot dead as is the banker the water holes are posioned the horses die bob played by chester morris is a no good rat sob is redeemed only by saving the baby he rejected throughout he dies a miserable death poisoned water john wayne s bob is a good guy with a sense of humor despite being a criminal he is hailed as a hero for saving the baby ward bond is the gruff but lovable sheriff he has a good plan for catching the bandits who are trapped in the desert with little water he wants to kill wayne until he discovers that the infant is actually his nephew wayne saved his life so they become good buddies of course wayne must pay for robbing the bank in the first place he gets a light jail sentence plans to return to see his godson when he gets out in both movies allusions are made to the three wise men the christ child the north star jerusalem the characters are aware of this there is a bit of reading from the dead mother s bible two of the bandits die on christmas day in the desert trying to keep the baby alive this is one of harry carey jr s first movies as the kid one of the bandits homage is played to his dad who had recently died played the part in a silent version of the three godfathers a little cowboy music is thrown in a good stocking stuffer this merry christmas

good if you don t mind minor edits finally got around to watching this last night in this review i m not going to bother to review the movie itself it s seventeen years old i m sure if you are interested in it you ve seen it by now rather i m going to review the technical quality of the film and the extras provided on the dvd one thing that feel i should point out up front is that the movie has been edited but only in one scene the infamous clergyman sporting an erection that caused such a stupid flundie flap has been photoshopped the theatrical poster artwork is not on the cover or anywhere on the disc for a similar reason you can find out more by going to snopes and looking in the disney films section i personally don t care but some people do now on to the review this version is widescreen but it s widescreen and not theatrical widescreen but this has been the case in pretty much all the disney movie dvds so no surprises there the little mermaid was the next to last movie disney did using painted cels and the film has gone through some kind of digital restoration process there are comparison shots on the back of the dvd box that show the difference the colors are very vibrant and i didn t notice any problems with the encoding or animation there is support for surround sound and audio tracks in english french and spanish its a two disk set disc one has the movie the configuration options subtitles commentary language ect a music video of the song kiss the girl by someone i ve never heard of a bunch of previews that will be outdated in a few months and a preview of what s on disc on the box it touts something called fast play which basically means when you load it in after the standard fbi warnings and all that the disc gives you the option of immediately starting the movie or going to the menu with the stuff i just mentioned if you choose to start the movie directly it plays a bunch of previews that you can skip past using chapter forward on your remote if you go to the menu and pick play movie it starts right away you re actually not forced to sit through ten minutes of bs previews with no way to skip them like on some of the previous disney dvds i approve the majority of the extras are on disc it s broken up into three major sections backstage disney deleted scenes and games backstage disney is the largest section it has scads of concept art imagine ursula as a lionfish or manta ray instead of an octopus a videos on how the movie was made and a new animated short the little match girl a silent film with a musical background and is amazingly enough actually true to the story it s pretty well done imho deleted scenes is just that stuff that was cut there really isn t much only three selections and two of them are just pieces that were cut from scenes that did make it in there s an expanded version of the opening song a very short scene where triton s daughters tell sebastian that ariel isn t at the recital before it starts and an extra verse in ursula s song all of these were cut before the final animation was done and so as you watch it switches back and forth between storyboard still shots and very rough sketchy animation the games i didn t even bother with because has there ever been a dvd player game that hasn t totally sucked didn t think so overall it s going to boil down to how much you like the movie and how much you hate minor edits if not seeing jessica rabbit with no underwear for three frames bothered you then this dvd is not for you otherwise it is a comprehensive look at the movie that marked the beginning of disney s second golden age i give it out of voice containing seashells 
long lost cinderella i have waited for fourty years to see this movie i enjoyed it as a child and now my seven year old daugther can enjoy it with me this is the best cinderella film of all time none of the other cinderella s can not top this one four sisters and myself grow up on this cinerella by rodger hammersteins and they all say this is the best cinderella thank you agian amozo 
my brother s favorite movie my brother henry always said this was his favorite movie he loved film noir although i didn t know what that was at the time and of course he loved richard widmark in his role looking back widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this he was nominated but there are many oscar shouldves if you like prison gangster movies classic film noir richard widmark victor mature and of course brian dunleavy you ve gotta see own this if you havn tdont already 
movie purchase thanks for the movie i appreciate it the delivery was decent no complaints 
a lovely movie one of my favorite movies of all time jessica lange and ed harris both turn in heartbreaking performances producing an achingly tender and moving portrayal of a complicated woman and her complicated relationship with the love of her life it s also very sexy and understated and the music is wonderful patsy cline s voice i understand that this isn t a very accurate account of patsy cline s real personality and life but it certainly doesn t detract from the movie if you like these actors you ll love the movie 
if you are a pilot or controller this is the funniest movie i am an air traffic controller and this movie is a comedy to me it is so far removed from reality it is absolutely hysterical this movie makes quotpushing tin quot look like a documentary i think airline pilots will also be highly entertained by the flight sequences especially where the airplane transforms into at least different types during the flight the only thing in the movie that is realistic is the different ways controllers handle stress the rest of the stuff equipment procedures phraseology is total fantasy people in the aviation industry will love it as a comedy while people not in the know seem to enjoy it as a drama 
engrossing from the first seconds clooney is a marvel this story was so captivating that i sat on the edge of my seat straining to hear all the dialogue althought the scene shifts make it difficult to track at first i was drawn in and held spellbound 
moving and beautiful excellent cinematography superb acting and a story that is engrossing believable and touching incredibly moving i laughed and cried bittersweet and honest a must see one of my all time favorites 
slapstick wisdom after finally catching mon oncle long on my list of movies i m supposed to see it s clear to me that there s no one who won t enjoy the movie from its rakish bookending sequences of dogs running around a modernized french town mon oncle sets itself up as the comedy that sniffs the ground as the movie to take aim at the bizarre confines of modern society that it is an indelible critique of the bizarre trappings of modernity is nice that it does so as a whimsical and effusive slapstick confection makes it perfect following mr hulot from one bizarre comic encounter with the harsh and illusory modern world to another mon oncle is all the more charming because of its vantage point hulot is simply good natured a jolly and misunderstood cartoon character of a man who you love all the more because of his refusal to criticize because of his acceptance of all that the backdrop of his sister s house where much of the action takes place is a stylized monstrosity in which kitchen utensils leap to life at a push of a button people greet each other moving in opposite directions and neighbors can be mistaken for rug salesmen only makes you revel in hulot s outsider goodwill as mon oncle nears its importance as a fable of fond authenticity cannot be overstated it s a movie whose timeless confusion at culture at large is both important and unnoticeable in the presence of its comic charm 
doctor who and the first download doctor who materialised without his tardis on this my first timelord download in the amazon unbox which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside for a very reasonable sum my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration where he encounters the nestene conciousness the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental a great experience and will not be the last easy to navigate and fun for all the family someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type tardis 
soylent green pure fantasy or potential reality my watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world the premise of the film was disturbing to say the least i have never been a true fan of charleton heston who in my opinion always has overacted however edward g robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played his performance was truly heartfelt bringing to mind the current debate on ending one s own life with dignity i shutter to think that this is life as it should be though but robinson s character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him i found the other actors to be somewhat bland perhaps this was acting at that point in time but some actors can make the most of roles and others cannot the story line was unique but the script was lacking a re make today by steven spielberg might be worthwhile seeing perhaps the most striking element i took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up 
very depressing tale the title of this movie holds no secrets the virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic between the acting and a great story line but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions 
defines black humor this is a witty morbidly funny movie it s weak in spots andthe occult quotmagicianquot comments in michael caine s voice over narration is perhaps a little misplaced but it is an original movie and entertaining and as michael caine said when making it quotthe thing is this guy is murdering people but you are on his side quot after seeing this movie you might find yourself looking at conniving rats in your life and thinking back to this movie ! even though michael caine plays an englishman it takes place in new york and is a very american piece in that it shows the absolute subtext of all american life is that you must be a success i ve seen this movie a number of times the humor is twisted but good 
a case involving an intriguing lady this movie is based on the story the disappearance of lady frances carfax written by sir arthur conan doyle to sherlock jeremy brett reads letters sent to him by the vacationing dr watson edward hardwicke in these letters watson is especially intrigued by the antics of lady frances carfax cheryl campbell who is vacationing at the same place he is there are three things in particular found in these letters a wheelchair bound major julian curry saves a drowning lady frances afterwards she is resentful of her rescue an unknown horseman jack klaff appears and his appearance is upsetting to lady frances lady frances prominent brother michael jayston visits her a loud argument ensues between sister and brother sherlock from watson s letters alone suspects something is going on he decides to go to the place watson is vacationing when he arrives it is discovered that lady frances has disappeared brett as usual does a good job of capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance curry and especially campbell also give good performances finally the costumes background music and cinematography are quite well done in conclusion this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it s based on min british drama made for tv full screen 
ladies night i cannot imagine a better aida than this met production performance from the sets and costumes spectacularly reflect the grandeur of ancient eqypt and james levine is in top form leading the ever fabulous met orchestra and a cast that if not pitch perfect is never less than first rateadmittedly neither domingo nor milnes is at their best here by this time milnes had lost a lot of the richness in tone and shading that made him one of the best bass baritones of his generation he pretty much wields his voice like a blunt instrument getting the job done but not much more and while this isn t an out andout off night for domingo it isn t one of his best either the performance seems to be taking more effort than usual particularly the high notes his modulation of the final whatever itis at the end of celeste aida is pretty much a metaphor for his entire performance the women are in a word spectacular i ve seen aprille millo at the met a number of times and cannot remember being so blown away perhaps by the time i saw her live she was in her decline in any event we re lucky that this dvd has captured what i think is one of the finest operatic performances i ve ever seen truly millo s vocal control is astounding the pianossimos are breathtaking and her acting no less so without ever toppling over the fine line into melodrama she s nothing short of a star here well deserving of the hugh ovation she receives from the met audience and i love zajick s interpretation of amneris on first glance she s the regal jealous bitch we ve seen in every other aida but this superb artist takes us deeper into the character in modern terms she s the awkward dumpy math geek who can t understand why the star athlete prefers the homecoming queen think heather matarazzo in todd solondz welcome to the dollhouse heartbreaking 
hilarious with perfect timing this is the film to watch if you want to learn about timing in comedy the plot is a farce about a married couple who almost divorce the film covers the games they play as they seek other partners to make each other jealous the humour encompasses witty one liners put downs pratfalls slapstick the lot cary grant is famous for his impeccable comedy timing so his performance in this film will not be a surprise even though it was his first really major success in irene dunne was a bigger star than grant although far less known today grant said she had the best timing of any of his co stars and you can see why here her gestures gurgles sardonic looks etc are perfection their interaction in scene after scene is the measure by which other comedy performers can be rated the scene in which dunne plays grant s coarse sister and appals his fiances s stuffy family is hilarious ralph bellamy also deserves mention for his parody of the lecherous hick watch him in one of the nightclub scenes any reviewer who takes the content of the plot seriously is absurd this is a frivolous masterpiece the dvd contains no extras but the print is good surely this is one famous comedy which would warrant an expert commentary ! 
great book the sum of all fears is about soldiers in war the book talks about the fear men have when they are in war we never think about the fear men have when they re in a war in the sum of all fears soldiers were surrounded by friends and men dying around them they worry about staying alive each second they crawl from one ditch to another soldiers are always thinking about their families at home the sum of all fears describes fears of men in all different countries in the middle east like israeli sea of galilee the first part is telling the time and places also what the men were doing the soldiers were involved in israeli held golan height on saturday the th of october these are soldiers recounting events my opinion of the sum of all fears is a very good book for it lets us knowledge about the fears men had have while they in a war to me a war is a long journey that soldiers go though and have no idea why i had a first cousion that went into the army and came home after basic trainning then he went on assignment three day later was killed leaving a wife and new baby boy only the government knows what the real fight is about while the media is give misleading information to the public but the sum of all fears was able to let me know some of the things soldiers deal with day today 
joe spinell will give you nightmares highly realistic and scary maniac is one of those movies that make me want to take a bath after i watch it because i feel gritty that in itself tells me it was a highly effective realistically sick movie and did what it was set out to do joe spinell is so good in this movie he had me scared to go into a public ladies room for weeks after i saw it when it came out in theatres much like jaws and the water and psycho and the shower of course tom savini is the master of gore in my opinion and he doesn t disappoint in this film is it gratuitous sure it is isn t that why we watch a slasher or horror film to be shocked or scared of course it is maniac is so scary and effective because it could really happen there are really franks spinells character out there shudder 
fabulous show this was a great show i can t say anything better than the other reviewers so i ll just say that this tape is a low cost alternative to the dvds that were released if you just want a little of the show for nostalgic purposes 
must be a fellini fan you must be a true f fellini fan to enjoy this one it is not as abstract as his other works but a good documentary type movie through the eyes of one of italy s greatest directors 
american freedom democracy and equality yes you can see the principles of the merciful religion of christ expounded by priests politicians and generals the innocence courage and heroism of the brave american soldier who go into a country which had just emerged from the shadow of french colonialism for tungsten and tin and burn thatched huts of peasants there and napalm and agent orange amazing the priest is happy that the work of christ is done and the politician that communism is being defeated and the general that our boys are good killers you can tell they will do it for oil too oh wait they are already 
great show bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining 
where the boys are sister i was about eight years old when the entire family went to see where the boys are it was so much fun watching the adventures of college girls and thinking one day when i grew and became a teenager these things might happen to me dolores hart was so lovely and earthy as merritt paula prentiss was so funny as tuggle yvette mimieux was so gracefully fawn like and because of her meltdown scene in the film amongst my sisters and i her character melanie was always thereafter referred to as the girl who walked out in the street of course connie francis belting and heart felt rendition of the title song was the icing on the cake for his dessert of a film 
has withstood the test of time i watched this in the theater years ago with my friend l when i was still a young un completely blew my mind i had never seen anything like it and i was fascinated by all the new concepts i ve watched it several times since then and have always enjoyed it i can t wait to see it again in widescreen at home 
great movie dedicated to the moving image unlike many other movies focused on linear narratives man with a movie camera is a movie truly dedicated to its medium this movie focuses on visuals made in russia in the s man with a movie camera foreshadows future visual epics like koyannisqatsi and hukkle 
sophia loren is the best i think this movie is one the best movies that were ever made i really loved it especially the third part sophia was really gorgeous and i think she is the most beautiful and sexiest woman in the world the story was really good it has three different stories each one was enjoying to watch and they were funny and entertaining i think sophia can make any movie she appears in very enjoyable i really enjoyed watching the movie and i recommend it to everybody to watch 
minutes of pure genius this is probably the first film presented like a dream switching in and out of disturbing sequences and images the infamous eye slashing scene every good horror film or art film owes a piece of it s plot to luis bunuel s un chien andalou 
love the new download i wanted it for my collection however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work 
so beautiful this movie was the most wait i can t go on i m still crying i ve never seen anything like this the plot was beautiful and the actors made you believe you were there you know i think i have to start writing letters to someone like that i mean i would have to go back to second grade and stuff but to find that deep true love oh what a gift i know i m not really helping you make a objective decision but please watch this movie 
great episode this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see 
worthwhile this unusal drama takes the viewer to a place where the dead visit their past life in this movie michelle pfeiffer convincingly plays a ghost that visits her husband on moonlit nights at their beach house where she accidentally was killed her husband played by peter gallager is clearly still hung up over his wife as displayed when he celebrates their anniversary even though michelle is dead claire danes plays her emotionally confused daughter that also has issues with her parent s apparent continual relationship beyond the grave overall it was a visually stimualting and heart warming movie that s worthwhile to watch even if the pace is a bit slow at times 
friendship fishing and fatherly bonds captains courageous begins with harvey freddie bartholomew a spoiled rich kid who uses bribes and cheats his way to getting what he wants when his father melvyn douglas finds out what his son is up to he plans a vacation together so that his son can learn how to be a decent human being and so the two can bond however harvey falls off the boat on the way and is salvaged by a portuguese fisherman named manuel spencer tracy who brings him aboard his fishing boat and teaches his how to be a proper man the film is filled with sentiment wonderful acting and good pacing it never gets boring there is always something happening even if the set the fishing boat is limited the cast is wonderful outside of bartholomew douglas and tracy lionel barrymore and mickey rooney grace the cast list the film is slightly dated there are scenes between bartholomew and tracy that pull at one s heart strings but sometimes they come off as being too close and slightly creepy especially in a modern world of child molesters however taking in the time period in which the film was made and the sincerity of the actors these cultural differences can be overlooked 
all the right company dennis quaid ranks high in our family video night both the parent trap and the rookie are among our young children s favorites for my wife and i i rented in good company due to quaid and because the film intrigued me its trailer and synopsis do not rely on quick action or screwball comedy it was different from most of what i see in good company relies on its characters i don t know the corporate world but as corporations seem to be today s resident evil pun intended i liked a story where a heart is found in the oz less world of layoffs and cubicles what i liked most was the interaction between dan forman played by quaid and carter duryea played by topher grace carter is fatherless basically he s parentless and the film shows a close foreman family but has little and little positive reference to carter s upbringing carter s world is psyche synergy cell phones and sports america where he now runs sales as the film progresses we are treated not just to an old school new school hip over the hill tension but see a young man learn character in work and family from someone who has done it right there are limitations as when foreman tells duryea that the secret to a good marriage is to find the right woman and keep your organ in your pants when you are away from home this is not too helpful for carter whose seven month marriage to the wrong woman shows a need for more than luck but overall he learns that life is more than suits cars and success he longs for he does not have throughout we see the pain of a young man all alone in the world someone who has had no one to guide him in one scene morty played by david paymer states that the right timing is important the film could easily have dived into a happy ending where everyone has a job and where carter gets the girl but it makes a good move by remaining true to that line when carter hugs foreman goodbye he squeezes him and breaks down when we next see carter he is jogging outside rather than on a treadmill he may not know where his path will lead but now thanks for dan foreman he is no longer running in circles 
this movie is a classic i saw this movie for the first time when i was back in and i have loved it ever sense it s about a boy named richard christopher atkins and a girl named emmeline brooke shields whoare sailing to san francisco with richard s father but then theship catches fire and every one has to escape the kids escapewith a man named paddy they come to an island where they livewith paddy until he dies and they have to live there alone and they wait for the day when they are rescued they grow up together on this island and as they grow and change they begin to have feelings for each other that they don t understand likeevery teenager does and they learn about love and sex and thenemmeline gets pregnant and then they have to learn about parent hood it s a wonderful love story for young adults to watch butnot for any one younger than some people thought that this movie was pornography and maybe for that time it was for some people but it s actually a beauti ful story about growing up and falling in love the people whothought it was pornography only saw that it was a year old girl running around an island naked but what they didn t know was that most of the time it wasn t brooke it was an year oldbody double this movie is a wonderful movie i learned so muchfrom this movie when i was i learned about love and yes ilearned about sex but watching this movie did not make me want to run out and have sex it made me want to fall in love i hadsuch a crush on christopher atkins after seeing him in this movie i thought he was such a hotty i still do and brooke was ok too i think every one would love this movie but of course they wouldhave to see beyond the nakedness and look at the story to reallylove it 
mickey rourke is awesome in a prayer for the dying loved this movie and thoroughly enjoyed mickey rourke s wonderful performance it was my only chance to hear him speak with a very convincing irish accent and see him with reddish hair excellent plot action very nice cinematography and soundtrack a real gem 
no s amours a very good first class film very fast delivery service highly recommende 
battlestar gallactica was ahead of its time this is the ten dollar offering of the pilot movie that started the epic series battlestar gallactica yes it is true that some of the special effects footage is used too many times but if you watch scenes like where cylon mother ships get to close the ground lightning then crashes them into carillon while eluding deception of large pursuing fleet you will realize that part of the reason the battlestar gallactica didn t workout is because it was ahead of its time ! the glass doors opening on the cylon base stars and the cylon s red eyes going back and forth were way ahead of their time in some of the props from this pilot movie were later used in buck rogers 
missed out in washington i missed the last few episodes of this series as i had to travel out of state now i have to buy the series to find out what happened thoroughly engrossing i hope there are more episodes in production 
excellent ! simply excellent this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really don t know what to think except that today is a day of honor i won t blow it for you watch this one first if you re not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures 
a classic and a great vehicle for ingrid bergman set in the s when the lighting in english households was powered by gas hence the title this psychological mystery worked as a diversion from the constant presence of the war for the american public when it was released in starring the incomparable ingrid bergman paula in an oscar winning role as a woman who marries a dark handsome and mysterious man charles boyer only to fall prey to his desire to drive her mad and steal her jewels gaslight remains one of director george cukor s many triumphs joseph cotton dame may whitty and angela lansbury in her debut at seventeen as a saucy parlor maid lent strong support i was particularly delighted with the busybody whitty who was born in and had made her film debut at the age of here she is rapid fire sure and feisty at age and funny both intentionally and unintentionally or i should say that whitty turned otherwise prosaic lines into little bits of delight i also recall her in hitchcock s brit classic the lady vanishes in which she had the title role the interesting thing is that in both movies whitty meets the young star on a train margaret lockwood there and bergman here and they become friends well here their friendship is a bit difficult for bergman s character for reasons that will become clear when you see the movie some of this will seem familiar especially the somewhat idiotic idea that a man may drive his wife crazy by playing nasty little tricks on her such as taking down pictures and hiding them or dimming the gaslights or walking like a ghost above her bedroom and the treatment may be a bit leisurely for today s audiences however this movie is very carefully constructed with plausible twists of plot and some fine foreshadowing boyer is almost comical in his machinations at times mad with jewel lust and syrupy smooth by turns a good reason to see this black and white classic is to compare how past master cukor features his leading ladies he also directed audrey hepburn in my fair lady judy garland in a star is born and katharine hepburn in adam s rib and pat and mike to name a famous few one thing is clear for several decades if you were a leading actress being in a george cukor film was an opportunity not to be missed but see this for ingrid bergman she dominates the movie with her exquisite beauty and her oh so expressive countenance in one of her more demanding roles the famous beguiling bergman smile however is not much in evidence since her character is so long suffering and passive and this too may try the patience of today s audiences you may find yourself wanting to say to paula get a backbone live a little and get rid of that rake but fear not paula does eventual get back at her oppressor culminating in a somewhat implausible but nonetheless agreeable scene near the end where he is tied up and begging her to get a knife and cut him free 
underrated romantic comedy prince s romantic comedy under the cherry moon finally received the dvd treatment it deserved in the summer of when the film was released it was bombarded with bad reviews but this film is actually decent of course the music stands out but it actually succeeds as a comedy the acting may be full of flaws but it s the s what do you expect prince and jerome benton from the time are gigolos living it up in south france and they come across a beautiful heiress kristin scott thomas who happens to get her trust fund on her st birthday they both woo her for the money but prince ends up catching feelings for her with a beautifully filmed movie and an incredible soundtrack under the cherry moon fails to disappoint 
awesome barbra streisand has always been controvertial i admire how she has spotted some of the untouchable topics in american movies full of criticism and courage the plot is well thought and presented in a very smooth way the thing i regret the most is that in many of barbra s movies we are prevented from seeing a happy ending ! great movie i enjoyed it a lot 
disgusting and brilliant it was hard for me to beleive that bad taste was directed by peter jackson the director of the amazing lord of the rings trilogy bad taste was jackson s directorial debut the film has that homemade feel except for the special effecs and camera angles and directing wich are done pretty professionally the movie is about a group of lame brain special agents fighting aliens who are planning on using earthlings as fast food the movie is definately not for the faint of heart the gore effects are pretty gross especially the scenes of brains oozing out of broken open heads there are also decapitations dismemberments disembowlments and a very disgusting scene were one of the agents enters and exits an alien by use of chainsaw bad taste is a disgusting gory and very enjoyable film if you dont take it seriously wich would be very hard to do get out the barf bag and enjoy 
total enchantment roadshow version over the decades i ve seen this film many many times on tv on vhs on laserdisc each time i saw it i wanted it to be a bit more than it was ive always wished i could appreciate the performance of ray walston as luther billis because all of his scenes were pure ham and he nearly ruined all the scenes he was in for me i have always wished im gonna wash that man right outta my hair was as complete in the film as it is on the rca soundtrack recording ill tackle this now the complete version never made any final cut of the film ive always wished i could see the film as originally assembled and premiered i have always wished alfred newman s scoring brilliant though it was in all the cuts i d seen of the film offered a bit more newman flair and now i m extremely gratified to say my wishes have nearly all come true this restoration print is phenomenal yes there are some washed out scenes but i don t care they are finally back where they belong this roadshow restoration was printed from a todd ao master negative and is a considerably different film from the one most of us have been exposed to the past years the print is magnificent clear and in many ways looks better than most new films look today this roadshow version resonates for me in ways that the theatrical cut never did time and again the music set my heart racing my pulse throbbing and my senses went into overload this film is a visual and aural feast it s also now my favorite film musical ever color filters bah ! get over em i read somewhere that cinematographer leon shamroy wanted them for the purpose of achieving enhancing emotional responses to scenes other sources say it was director joshua logan who insisted on using them primarily because he had experimented with such things in the broadway production i know many responses have been sheer hatred disdain for all the filters but i love many of them those i don t i ignore ive read heard a lot of hoo haw about the casting of nellie forbush including the highly negative and wishy washy commentary by richard barrios a film historian whose commentary is replete with people have said many people some people people a friend someoneall in the negative and always attributing his negativity to unnamed others he seemingly owns nothing he says but doesn t mind repeating what he has heard this depletes him of any sort of authority on the subject it s unfathomable to me that a studio would afflict a restoration of one of its most profitable movies with such absurd negativity especially given the film s many admirers much has been discussed about why mary martin and ezio pinza did not recreate their roles one of the features on the second disc will show you why check out the numbers performed in that rodgers and hammerstein tv tribute three years before filming began on the movie version martin looks to be somewhere in her s she was and matronly plump and pinza who was looks terrible and totally unromantic leadish you can get away with a lot on stage but you cannot hide such things on camera i doubt that martin was ever considered for the role and pinza died in mary martin was a great shining star of the broadway musical theater she had a lightly raspy singing voice that she invested with great emotional nuance and feeling i am a huge fan of martin s and mean her no disrespect in my observations above barrios maintains that mitzi gaynor s voice was not in martin s league i m not sure what he means by that because to my ears gaynor s voice is leagues better than martin s in quality and range he may be saying he felt martin s intepretation of the songs was better and he comes off as one of those somewhat snooty theatrical drama mavens for whom nothing translated to the screen from the theater will ever be good enough but i disagree with virtually everything that comes out of his mouth on the commentary so i won t mention him again there is talk that elizabeth taylor was a candidate what a blessing that never happened the other great sighinthesky complaint is that doris day would have been perfect as nellie but that she turned off joshua logan at a party one night when she refused to get up and sing for guests i d always heard she refused to audition for richard rodgers at any rate i certainly cannot imagine doris day with her all toofamiliar mannerisms as nellie forbush in south pacific i know she had the look but i think gaynor was by far the best choice of those considered for the role many will strongly disagree and many of those will be the same folks who still bemoan the loss of frank sinatra as billy bigelow in carousel the visual imagery of that casting still induces giggles that slight skinny man wearing a barker s cap and being a rugged barker on a carousel i think hollywood dodged a huge misfire when he walked out on that film watch gaynor s performance closely in this roadshow version she is luminous she is restrained she is exuberant she is up to the task in every scene and pulls off some incredibly difficult scenes with great dramatic effect her vocals are magnificent and the huge surprise for me ray walston is wonderful as luther billis they restored much footage of him much of what was missing was character development and nuances in the cut version we saw only the more hyper extreme elements of his performance this restored luther billis is terrific and walston owns the role being a film music fan of many many decades i have to say that it s always the music that counts most for me in any musical not to mention any other kind of film but south pacific is alfred newman s masterpiece he took a classic broadway score and made it shine more gloriously than it had ever shone before it s thrilling beyond words to have newman s original scoring returned to the film many glorious flourishes pop up frequently to great effect the entire segments like cable s walk through the jungle of bali ha i with bloody mary an entire chunk of film with an entire chunk of original music restored the newman scoring of this chunk brings to mind the opening music in the vision sequence in the song of bernadette but with exotic colorings employed rather than religious ones newman s work set a standard that has never been remotely approached by anyone but newman himself in cameloti cannot recommend the restored roadshow version of south pacific more highly see it and ignore entirely the accompanying commentary 
the burmese harp i don t usually make a lot of blind buy especially concerning criterion discs all i can say is the burmese harp is a damn good film from director kon ichikawa a director whose films i ve never seen but hope to fix its melancholic beautiful and truly one of the best war films ever made without all of that fuss people consider great in war movies mainly overly hyped battle scenes that are meant to distract from cliched plots and what goes for characters thats one of the refreshing things i suppose in the movie most movies dealing with the horrors of war seem to focus on mans inhumanity to man with characters who fit into that good and evil state in harp the japanese soldiers surrender without firing a shot the captain of the platoon works with british soldiers sending a willing soldier to a lone mountain where another group of soldiers is hold against against british forces willing to fight to the last man despite the fact that japan had already surrendered even in these scenes the movie doesn t focus on the fact the evil of the men but the sadness of watching men focused on dying over something that doesn t exist anymore the soldier mizushima is hurt in the ensuing shootout between british and japanese forces found by a monk while he s reported dead to his captain dressed in monks robes mizushima marches back to his troop horrified that along the way thousands of dead men lie rotting in the sun he gets to the prison camp but after witnessing british burying a dead a dead japanese soldier goes back out into the burma countryside making it his mission to bury the soldiers i didn t mean to give a plot synopsis and really theres more to the plot than i described the film is at times delicate with one scene i could describe as heavy handed the acting is generally good with a standout being rentaro mikuni as the captain of the soldiers a man who at first wants to find the missing soldier like his men but in one instance understands what is happening to the man and gives up trying to find out if he s alive and the direction and writing is amazing as well criterion does well with the dvd presenting a beautiful transfer i m not one who sings the praises of black and white photography but then i find something like this film that blows me away with an amazing use of shadow light in scenes its a beautiful film well represented and also worth noting is akira ifukube s magnificent score which is epic and beautiful i don t know how much he worked with but as music plays large part of the films story with the soldiers being led in songs many times for a variety of reasons there are times where it adds to the story as well as the viewing experience one small caveat i understand from the liner notes that director ichikawa did a remake using the same script he even had the same actress that plays an old woman trading with the japanese soldiers in the prison camp of the film in sure it would have made the disc more expensive but as criterion has put out discs featuring two versions of the same story floating weeds the lower depths it would have been interesting to see this film provided sure it would probably be a lesser work compared to the original but i m interested in seeing how the same director redoes his own masterpiece 
a wonderful criterion issue i am biased on this film one of my favorites right up there with the best of hitchcock so i will only say for the movie itself that image and sound meet the high criterion standard what i was more happily surprised about was the impression the bonus features had on me my usual favorite bonus feature is the commentary track providing interesting tidbits on the production and actors although it is quite informative my only bone to pick is that linda darnell was not as stated when making the movie so that the age difference between the married couple was actually as significant as it was for the story i believe it is outshone by two other bonus features terry jones gives a quirky heartfelt introduction that conveys a true love for sturges and his work best of all is sandy sturges sturges s widow and fourth wife it is easy to understand how an erudite genius could love such a woman ! delicate proper articulate self effacing diplomatic and blunt she is worth the price of admission ! 
informative this was my first download and it was free the download performed well the mystery of edgar allan poe was informative it ran up to minutes this was a unbox video download it started with the typical intro and ended with the credits some individuals did not get a complete download so i included my experience with the unbox download i hope the review was helpful ty 
eddie and the cruisers the movies were purchased for my wife she has enjoyed both eddie and the cruisers and eddie lives very much she would highly recomend both movies 
kiss today goodbye this is a release and stars michael douglas as a broadway director casting dancers for a large production i enjoyed the movie yet completely agree with others that the stage version is much better and makes more sense of the story line many people saw the stage version first i do understand their frustration with the film in particular it skews the number what i did for love into emphasizing the love story between cassie and zach what it s really about is the love and dedication dancers have for what they do through all the blood sweat and tears i went out of order and saw the movie first and wound up thoroughly enjoying the stage version a positive experience last rather than the generally negative reception from those who sequenced the other way best strategy is to enjoy each the stage version and film version for what they are entertainment 
magical film this is a lovely film happy and sad do you believe in magic magic becomes reality in this film as it equates to love friendship perserverance and the optimism of young hearts sometimes magical miracles happen with the help of love from heaven and on earth 
completely mind blowing i am currently a medical student hoping to have a future career working specifically with hiv aids patients when i ordered this movie i was expecting any typical drama movie that is not well dramatized when i received the movie i watched it before taking it to class the next day and i was just shocked at how informed i was of the disease it is so incredible ! i took the movie to school the next day and everyone that has not seen the movie had the same reaction that i had even the teacher had watched it before and was still moved by it if you are unsure of buying it i can tell you that it is a movie to own if you are into true life dramas everytime that i watch it i am still floored by how our world had changed by this epidemic ! 
the glory of the beatniks this movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun it is the furthest thing from a slow moving documentary the technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer the source is glossy and gorgeous the director s clout is also impressive johnny depp gives a performance monologue as jack kerouac and john torturro gives an emotional reading from howl dennis hopper imitates burroughs as well later in the film their efforts are impressive just to let the skeptics out there know there is no room for doubt in this documentary the beats are heroes and saviors and not much else is considered that some of them were minor talents is brushed over massive beat generation fans would give it five stars a totally sanitized version of william s burroughs is presented and it is implied that kerouac was only a heterosexual which is something that most commentators would regard as dubious the film s attitude towards drug use is rather slanted one memorable quotation was you can overdose on anything including sushi well no not really it does not matter though the movie is an amazing sprint and it succeeds in making itself impossible to turn off 
opm used in my business management classes there is no nudity in this movie but there are some vaguely sexual discussions even some adults might miss the true points being made but you may want to consider that before allowing children to see opm that said this is the best business movie i have ever come across when i first saw it in the theater i was all for gregory peck s character until devito s speech at the end which is truly thought provoking in teaching business management at the university of southern mississippi i have my students watch the whole thing at the beginning of the semester to acquaint them with the notion that those who have the goal of making money are not all bad for some reason even though they want to be in business my students too often think of running a business and making money as grubby nasty chores performed by evil people the characters in opm force them to examine those beliefs other reviewers have made the point that this a funny movie and it truly is the humor is probably better appreciated by adults than children since it is not of the slapstick kind but rather uses plays on words while the characters in opm are somewhat one dimensional what i enjoyed is that they are always true to themselves when offered a million dollars by piper laurie s character to go away devito responds it is not enough she was being true to her goals of minimizing conflict in her company and he was being true to his goals of maximizing his wealth when asked why he gives an answer that shows that he doesn t accept the idea that he is the bad guy in this drama i particularly appreciated the movie not making devito s character out to be a totally bad guy that is a real failing of most movies coming out of hollywood other reviewers have talked about how his relationship with penelope ann miller s character shows his humanity but i think people should take note of his relationship with his chauffeur and his secretary and their loyalty to him he makes use of his reputation as a tough guy to serve his business needs but there is much more to the man all together this is truly a great movie it amazes me that it took so long for it to come out on dvd since it has all the stars in the world devito peck miller laurie stockwell etc

some people actually like these movies ok first if you want a movie to pass the time and not be bored with it watch spy kids because i love them how can people compare these to the incredibles i think either one of these are superior to it the incredibles drags itself painfully i think that one deserved a little itty bitty notice because it was wayyyyy too over hyped after awhile i wanted to turn it off and put it in a box and never touch it again because that one made me bored ! anyway the reason why i m writing this is because you don t have too be stupid to like them you have to be stupid to hate them and hey you know these movies are trying to say that you can do anything without having to be too young or too old for it oh yeah why are you saying that the kids are bad influences look at nickelodeon last year they were in a building with a giant head on a wall and kids had to pull flags out of it nose or get dunked with slime and it made sneezing noises and i think the head was saying something like this oh my nose i think i m going to sneeze now uhuhuhuh chooo and slime came out of the nose and dunked a kid in slime everywhere and the person with the flag won and they do even more disgusting things and it s like they re saying it s ok to do disgusting stuff with or without your parents saying it s bad which is not true i don t like that that s why nickelodeon is going bad if it wasn t for spongebob i wouldn t have watched nickelodeon at all anyway number is great i liked the creatures alot and it s funny at least they didn t kill the badguy off they made friends with him and if they killed him you people would be saying well they could have been friends

when the truth hurts what happens when little max reede justin cooper blows out the candles on his birthday cake and wishes his dad couldn t lie anymore fletcher jim carrey an unscrupulous lawyer is there any other kind happens to be max s father when the birthday wish becomes reality things quickly begin to fall apart for poor fletcher after all what good is a lawyer who can t lie one thing is certain fletcher is about to discover how much the truth can both hurt and heal first let me say that i m not generally a jim carrey fan i find his films inane vapid and predictable that along with his excessively loud over thetown acting style absolutely drives me crazy with that said i must now confess that i ve found one exception to that rule that exception is the unrelentingly hilarious liar liar all the things that drive me insane about jim carrey somehow work wonderfully in this film it also contains a cast of some of my favorites maura tierney as fletcher s ex wife audrey and cary elwes as her new love interest jerry i also have to mention the very sexy krista allen makes a brief but memorable appearance as the girl in the elevator 
a very clever and dark thriller there have many excellent reviews of this movie therefore i would only be going over what so many have already written about this wonderful film what i will say however is that this is an excellent movie this film is a great study in psychological suspense that keeps the viewer guessing as to who the killer is spoiler when the travelers converging at a motel on a rainy night begin to die one by one and all in a mysterious and supernatural type way you begin to wonder if this is some kind of ghost story on the contrary we are all in the mind of a serial killer pruitt taylor vince and his split personalities are beginning to merge the only way for him to succeed in becoming whole again is to discard the make believe world that his mind has created therefore we witness the killings that are perplexing and yet real to the mind of this killer john cusack gives a good performance as the limo driver as does ray liotta as the policeman escaped convict and of course the role of the psychiatrist alfred molina trying to prevent the scheduled execution of the aforementioned serial killer does an excellent acting performance as well i highly recommend this movie it is definetly different than many if not most of the thrillers on the market today 
great dvd music artist and story cuban music nothing better buy this dvd because it is a great beautiful story because it brings to the front the great talent and warmth of the cuban people but to clarify one issue these musicians or music were never forgotten this music was made illegal after the revolution they were thus made usless to the revolution nothing to do with the embargo it was the castro regime that made this music illegal to be heard or recorded because it was deemed un revolutionary anything prior to the revolution was bad so politics do matter from that moment on musicians and singers could only sing songs that extolled the values of the revolution that is one of the biggest reason that so many jazz group developed in the island that was the way musicians found they could play this music and not be forced to interject the required lyrics required by the goverment it was not until the government found that they could make money of their backs that they let them sing and play again watch the end of this dvd when ibrahim ferrer sings his closing song at carnagie hall look deep into his eyes and you will see the soul of a man that realizes what his god given gifts could have given him had he had the oportunity that was taken away from him by one man cuban music still thrives it will always be because it s in all our hearts it s part of who we are it is our national joy and pride 
whats so memorable about a clown stealing a million dollars if you need a laugh or if you need a stupid idea that may land you in jail than this movie will give you just that also this movie has some well known actors to boot other than just bill murray as grimm geena davis as phyllis potter randy quaid as loomis i m talking about tony shalhoub as the cab driver kurtwood smith reginald red forman from that s show as russ crane a ka mr lombino even the late phil hartman as hal edison and well known to movies of the s s and the s jason robards as chief rotzinger i do wonder why it took so long to release it to dvd 
rodgers hammerstein s cinderella dvd i was very well pleased in receiving my purchase of a dvd movie rodgers hammerstein s cinderella for many years i have seached all over for even seeing this movie once again which i saw for the very firt time on television way back when i was in rd grade in school i fell in love with that movie and i have even tried to order it through my family video store and they told me they couldn t get it at all i went online and amazon com popped up and i saw it there saying there was only one copy left i immediately ordered it through amazon com and received it very quickly through ups and i would like to say everything was excellent and thank you amazon com i have also ordered a tricycle for my granddaugher through amazon com and the service and quality was also excellent i highly recommend for everyone to go to amazon com for their special ordering needs

if you have to listen to folk music let it be this i m delighted to see there aren t a string of star reviews from people who don t get a mighty wind if it has a weakness its that its played so dryly its almost like non fiction that just happens to be funny thank god for fred willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these serious proceedings i share a sentiment expressed by some of the characters i ve never liked folk music but somehow this movie manages to poke fun at those less cynical times without being too cynical itself my one dissapointment is that we don t get to see ed begley jr sing how s it hangin grandma in swedish talk about a missed opportunity 
cult classic movie this movie is wrong on so many levels which is why i love it it s not so much dark comedy as much as it s just funny about a rich guy who wants his wife dead and the incompetent kidnappers who can t understand why the husband is pushing them add to that the rich guys lover and her other boyfriend who as the cop describes in the movie this may very well be the stupidest man on the face of the planet perhaps we should just shot him great cast great writing 
rebel without a cause rebel without a cause the film that made james dean a star and a film that still seems relevant today if you ignore the style and words that the characters use kids are still like this today on the american film institute s top list the film stars dean as jim stark when we meet jim he is stumbling drunkenly through the streets he s arrested and at the police station we meet the other two major players plato sal mineo and judy natalie wood plato nowadays would be a likely candidate for a school shooter in the police station we learn that he was arrested for shooting puppies he s a lonely kid with no parents and no friends judy is a typical high schoolgirl who hangs out with the local gang and has daddy issues jim himself is the new kid in town trying to find a place to belong his parents are constantly fighting in one famous scene early on he reveals youre tearing me apart and constantly moving him around while on a field trip to the planetarium an odd thing to do on the first day of school he finds himself in a knife fight with the head of the local gang buzz jim wins but is challenged to a game later that night that involves two people driving a car towards the edge of a cliff and whoever jumps out first is a chicken the movie miraculously takes place over the course of a day odd since it has enough events to fill at least a month of time this is the first film i ve seen with james dean and this is a terrific performance making it not hard to see why he has remained a screen icon all these years many people will recognize while watching the film that it still works to this day kids don t dress like this or call each other chicken anymore unless they re in kindergarten knife fights aren t in but it still manages to capture the feelings and problems one has in adolescence it s one of the few classic movies that modern day kids will be able to enjoy as well as their parents grade 
great episode this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see 
shamefully overlooked southern gothic murder mystery has atmosphere genuine thrills and the superb blanchett this is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around which is a shame since director sam raimi just before hitting the jackpot with the spiderman franchise has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving movie i was in a town on the southernmost tip of chile when i first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have hbo not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the tv set back then cowritten by billy bob thornton upon whose mother s psychic gifts the story is based and tom epperson the plot revolves around the disappearance of jessica starlet the daughter of a wealthy resident of a georgia backwater town tired of blind alleys the police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson a single mother of three sons who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic fortune teller annie thinks she finds a suspect in donnie barksdale the abusive white trash husband of one of her most devoted customers valerie complicating matters for annie is her attraction to wayne collins her eldest son s teacher and jessica s fiancee and buddy cole another of annie s customers a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child while it s not perfectly constructed the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters voices and motivations throughout raimi s expert direction is full of sumptuous southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story credit needs to be given to jamie anderson s cinematography and neil spisak s production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns including katie holmes as the spoiled baby faced debutante jessica greg kinnear as the seemingly stalwart wayne keanu reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife beater donnie and giovanni ribisi as the deeply troubled buddy in the smallish role of valerie hilary swank makes her moments count as she cringes from donnie s scarifying dominance over her but it s the wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi dimensional performance as annie with a convincing southern accent she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us the dvd is short on extras a fifteen minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews the movie s trailer and a video of neko case s furniture room lullaby which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric character driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer 
amazing plot superb script and sublime acting from a brilliant cast i saw the great santini in the theatre in when it was first released i always thought that warner brothers did a huge disservice to the film by retaining the original pat conroy book title although the later re release as the ace also fails to inspire despite the somewhat lackluster title this is an absolutely superb film when viewed on many levels i was originally interested in the film because of the aviation context but that really only provides a medium for robert duvall to develop the character of bull meechum the real story here revolves around family and interpersonal dynamics in an early s military family duvall gives a stunning performance in the title role as a hard charging marine fighter pilot who finds expressions of affection next to impossible although a pg rated film the language and violence there is no nudity are not excessive and are only used when necessary to further the plot largely in the anti racism subplot despite this some of the scenes are very difficult to watch as they hit very close to home for people familiar with difficult family situations the scene where michael o keefe beats duvall in basketball is one of the all time most amazing scenes in cinema i think that the entire cast is perfect in every way stan shaw gives an incredibly effective performance as toomer in a subplot that addresses the futility of racism better than any other film i have ever seen i find the scene of red and toomer with the bees and the dogs is one of the most poignant and brilliantly acted in history the subtle complexity of the emotions especially hatred and sorrow in that one scene make the film worth watching and should be required viewing in film schools everywhere likewise blythe danner is amazing as the longsuffering military wife and mother by far the most important component of the film is the family relationships within the meechum family and in particular the conflict between duvall and o keefe both were nominated for oscars for these roles and i firmly believe that both should have won as both give brilliant performances of the two though i actually think that o keefe does the better job in the exceptionally difficult role of the year old son the emotional range that o keefe demonstrates in this film put him in the league of truly great actors like duvall every time i have seen this film i have come to admire o keefes portrayal more this is one of the best films from the s and deserves more recognition than it has ever received i give the film five stars no question about that although the warner brothers packaging leaves a lot to be desired there are no commentary tracks or other extras on the dvd and that s a real shame nonetheless this is a world class drama with occasionally brilliant comic insights that is as finely done as any other film i have ever seen i highly recommend the great santini to everyone 
one of the best episodes i urge everyone out there to download this episode ! this one totally rocks ! shep a wraith and kolya all in one episode ! any episode with shep joe flannigan and kolya are well worth watching ! download this and download every other stargate sg and stargate atlantis episode ! 
middle class middle aged baby boomers was this you this movie probably falls flat for anyone not of the characters ages at the time of this movie early s about mid to late thirties these were people affected by anti war movements race riots the sudden availabilty of college to almost any comer they have their faults have stumbled and succeeded in life or at least hung on for the ride when one of this once tight knit group commits suicide the gathering of the survivors and an occasional dragged along spouse leads to increasingly deeper insights into themselves each other the world around them with such a large strong ensemble cast the movie can t probe too deeply but overall the deep abiding friendships that brought these people together in the first place during their college years works its magic again for a weekend anyway they reconnect circle each other in ways based on their past but tempered by the passing of time when they became responsible said like a four letter word they play replay their lives relationships against the canvas of meg tilly s character a much younger something who had been living with the deceased friend the gang constantly look to her for clues to answer the question why did he do it but in the end their answers come from within themselves the great soundtrack is perfectly aimed at people coming of age in the sixties crystalizes that moment in time so well the cast is superb most having become recognized as well toned rising stars at the movie s release anyone who was influenced by and was growing up in the sixties seventies who hung out with a group of friends who included an egghead a nerd a macho guy a cool dude a sexy girl a hippie girl a gearhead a druggie or alkie or some combination can relate very much to this great movie all others need to understand that like many retrospective movies much has been glossed over certainly this represents only a certain group of these baby boomers 
i wonder i wonder why the beautiful lerner loewe meoldies and lyrics and the movie itself are not more popular than they are i ll go home with bonnie jean the heather on the hill almost like being in love the movie itself is a serious production meticulous in costumes design and choreography this is a fairy tale almost a charming ghost story which is so unreal that it only happens in old places like the scottish highland something beautiful that emerges beneath the fog only once in a while the story is also rich in scottish culture bagpipes kilts market place and folklore i also wonder why van johnson with a big build and yet such a nimble tap dancer did not have more dancing roles in other movies and cyd charisse ballet dancing is simply an eye candy the melodies are so sweet and chorus so pure that the movie is worth watching over and over again even if it is only for the songs 
ginger s turn to shine while somewhat different than their charming and endearing musical films this entry from fred and ginger is probably my favorite fortunately all the great elements that made the previous films so wonderful are still here but this time those elements are interspersed between some nice screwball comedy that finally got to showcase ginger s comedic talents fred is great as always but this one is really ginger s film and she shines once again a fine pandro s berman production and some magical songs by irving berlin made this mark sandrich film a sheer joy an original idea by marian ainslee and guy endore was adapted to story form by dudley nicols and hagar wilde then turned into a screenplay by allan scott and ernest pagano fred and ginger with fine support from ralph bellamy jack carson and luella gear turn all these elements into what i believe is the most fun of all their films tony fred is a psychiatrist trying to do his pal stephen ralph bellamy a favor by seeing his radio singer fiance amanda ginger so he can figure out why she has called off their wedding three times ! she blows fred off as a quack when she overhears a transcription he s done which is less than flattering but finally gives in and agrees to let tony disect her dreams and discover what s wrong with her a meal of lobster and mayonnaise and a lot of other things make her dream alright but in her dream she s dancing with tony ! amanda can t tell him of course and when he threatens to stop seeing her she makes up a dream that would keep ten psychiatrists busy and the fun really begins rogers was fabulous in this film and it was the impetus for her very successful solo career this light screwball comedy has some terrific moments it s a laugh riot as ginger walks out while being hypnotized thinking she loves bellamy and going after fred with a shotgun so he can die like a dog ! as fred tells bellamy while they run after her shes in a trance she may even act a little odd ! during the dream sequence they get to dance to i used to be color blind and later on at a party they do the yam in a very fun scene berlin s change partners was nominated for an oscar but ginger and the screwball comedy take top billing in this one making it one of their best it is sophisticated and funny and fred and ginger end up together as always this time she s in a gorgeous wedding dress and she has a black eye you don t hear as much about this one but don t let that stop you from picking up this wonderful film 
great this has been one of my favorite musicals and is great for those more mature musical fans 
more artistic than historic called a breathtaking journey into the heart of darkness the cinema tail of the conquest of don lope de aguirre klaus kinski and how it might have been as they traverse the amazon river filmed in peru in search of the mythical lost city of gold some see it as real others see holes you can drive a truck through any way you see it this is a good place to start in the new german cinema movement a good choice of actors and great visuals this is also an intense way to learn some german the victim on the raft is full of arrows and he gets kicked before the revealing statement er ist tot 
alien nation sent promptly in great condition alien nation was sent promptly it is in excellent condition great service 
using eastern philosophy to justify the slacker lifestyle donal logue sean finnerty of grounded for life plays a heavyweight ladies man who is well read in the classics particularly eastern philosophy which he uses to rationalize his lifestyle he and his friends divide the world into steve s the cool guys and stu s the gomers and have some witty exchanges around this logues character lives a stoner existence and is having an affair with a friend s wife until he inevitably meets the woman who changes his perspective and he falls in love this is a very entertaining romantic comedy with several engaging characters and it is beautifully filmed in the santa fe area logue is believably shallow but still likeable in the lead role 
teen wich is probably the best movie i have ever seen i was so happy when i watdched this classicc of my childhood and found that it had aged so wonderfully the scenes where the people rap are so amazing it reminds me of westside storyi think therei s not a better s movie a nd i like the girl in it because she is redheadeda nd not molly ringwald anywone and everyone should see this movie and stock up on it before it goes out of print wonderful drama 
saving grace is worth saving this is a delightful film a very funny british comedy craig ferguson who wrote the script and co stars is one very creative guy if you haven t seen it check out the late late show on cbs which he now hosts he is the funniest guy on late night tv in my humble opinion i ve shared the saving grace dvd with a few friends and they have all loved it just sayin 
a man goes to a place and he becomes the undead great horror movie 
a masterpiece this by far is pauly shore s best work yet i mean who thinks of this stuff a hippie marries someone who is related to farmers and i mean pauly shore could care less about a family of farmers but throughout the movie the unthinkable happens a hippie bonds with farmers this is better than bio dome times and throw in a movie like cabin boy and you will have a masterpiece like this if pauly shore was a chef andson inlaw was the meal he made he would be working in the finest restaurant in france 
my favorite movie sometimes you just want a movie that is predictable but that you can watch over and over again 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography 
queen latifah shows that she s worthy of the title queen once again queen latifah is so extrodinary in this movie i really enjoyed watching this dvd when i first purchased it because queen latifah is such a professional actor and i love every single movie that she has played in because she deserves it all because it seems that everytime she gets a new role movie she continues to do so well in every movie that she has gotten a role for queen latifah stay strong and keep your head upi love you queen latifah your fan tiffany mille

star is born dvd very good service very good however would like to see dvd cd book purchases combined for shipping allowance probably would order more 
unforgettable and wonderful i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on its been some time now and i plan to buy it waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father i didn t realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon a heartbreaking beautifully acted and must see film rings true to life they certainly don t make movies like this anymore and it s a shame 
an excellent original movie the bride wore black is not your typical french film it keeps your attention throughout the whole film i have never come across something quite like it the film is centered around a woman who is seeking to kill five men when the film commences you have no idea exactly why she is doing this through her clever tactics she manages to kill them all as the film progresses you understand each piece of the puzzle and by the end the puzzle fits together and you learn exactly why the film is called the bride wore black and why she needed to get her revenge 
for dance lovers good movie to show people the difference between ballroom dance and fun dance best dance movie i ever seen 
clever comment on reaganism set in a galaxy of post transformational liberalism just kidding i don t know what i m talking about you should see this movie if you like sex nudity hot babes mickey rourke carre otis mickey rourke and carre otis going at it for real perfume commercials directors trying to make their softcore porn look like art by filming everything sensually and in slow motion so the film appears to be arthouse and visually stimulating really really really bad dialogue lots of good banging and screwing without a plot mickey rourke playing a total pimp which is different than just mickey rourke i mean there s mickey rourke and then there s mickey rourke the pimp which is even cooler and finally hot female characters who wear glasses and carry around clipboards so the audience believes they are smart and successful businesswomen when in fact they d have a hard time calculating also see alone in the dark tara reid s character or fantastic four jessica alba s highly recommended to the appropriate demographic i could kill myself for buying it 
when the did we get ice cream the ringer is the kind of movie where upon a quick glance most people would assume is made strictly to shock and offend considering the infamous farrelly brothers theres something about mary me myself irene stand by as producers one could imagine the many cheap shots this movie would take surprisingly though it doesn t and despite the restrictions the movie gives itself it s quite funny at times and despite a somewhat predictable plot it s actually a bit heartwarming and sentimental apparently i m in the minority of people who actually enjoyed this movie then again i tried not to keep my expectations up too high for starters this isn t exactly a farrelly brothers movie so don t go in expecting that type of humor sure it shows up at times but the ringer is more conventional than those movies johnny knoxville from jackass is perfect as steve a reluctant participant in the special olympics coerced by his uncle gary played by brian cox manhunter red eye steve is forced into the games in part to pay off his uncle s bookies but also to be able to afford surgery to replace the three severed fingers of the man he hired to mow his lawn the plot does get a bit ridiculous at points and you can see steve s happy ending with lynn katherine heigl of bride of chucky a volunteer at the olympics coming miles away but despite all that the movie does a good job carrying a message without being condescending or losing it s sense of humor if you look at the cover of the dvd or read any reviews and feel the urge to be instantly offended don t the ringer is quite well done and actually features many mentally disabled actors in prominent roles and if that s not enough for you it s also flat out funny it s simply a good comedy with a decent story and an interesting and original angle just don t take it too seriously 
good clean fun boy let me tell you if you are trippin on some good acid this movie will make perfect sense i was a little confused until ben franklin made his amazing cameo and tied the whole movie together with not sosubtle references to child slavery and sexual abuse appearing all to often it keeps the watcher guessing in closing the only thing i enjoy more than watching this movie is watching this movie on shrooms thanks to this movie i now know the true meaning of newyears 
interesting film i found this film very interesting and thought provoking it is the perfect movie to watch on a dark raining night scary and it reminded me of a gothic tale of old loved the costumes it is also a perfect movie for a movie club to discuss 
great ski movie for the ski enthusiast i have seen this movie before but unlike in the past i didnt have to sit thru endless commercials the dvd format is much better and it brings you up close as if you are there experience the rushof the snow and powde 
dated sure boring no way i watched this with my year old daughter last night she was into it with her short attention span for the whole film one pleasant surprise it has a pretty good chase scene i like chase scenes any sf fan will welcome this in his her collection a few good comic shots watch richard benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the jail break 
come on it wasn t that bad the movie wasn t as horrible as some make it out to be it surely wasn t the worst vampire movie ever jon bon jovi didn t suck in the roll either 
what about your wife a young czech man named milos hrma begins work in a train station in nazi occupied czechoslovakia his father retired from the same job and is now on paid retirement milos is very pleased to have a job that doesn t require hard work and his mom is very proud that her son has been given an attractive uniform the envy of the neighborhood at the station the employees are more interested in romance than in work there s a lot of sex going on during those slow hours in the night when few trains appear but our poor hero milos is not part of the sex play he is a virgin and a very funny and naive one there is a beautiful sweet girl interested in him but she doesn t know that he is a virgin and she is in for a disappointment during his first attempt he s really not ready for her meanwhile his funny co worker is having a ball in one cute scene the co worker uses the official german stamp presses to decorate the body of a beautiful girl in other words he puts a few official stamp imprints on her butt and elsewhere i like one of the characters a german fool who explains the troop movements in world war two to the boys on the job he describes all of the military setbacks as strategic withdrawals pretending that his side is winning the war even as the allies roll back the german defense in europe near the end of the film things get a bit political yet still in a comedic way there is a plan to sabotage an ammunition train to blow up a trainload of german ammunition the central characters in the plot are the czech playboy with the stamper our poor hero milos who is distressed at his inability to make love to a woman to the point of suicide and the other boys at the job a stunning young woman comes by with a bomb she represents the czech underground she hears of milos s problem and decides to take action leave it to a czech undergrounder to solve the problem she makes a happy man of him as a result now that he is a man he is more than able to join the resistance to nazi oppression the film has a powerful ending it is really a wonderful story the only criticisms i have are that it starts a bit slow for me not really picking up until the middle chapters and that it is overly flattering to the czech population a bit self serving as if every czech male was happy to lay down his life for the chance at fighting the germans as if all of the czechs were as kind and innocent as the characters in this story without a hint of racial hatred in them we know that to be false czechoslovakia was caught up in the vicious antisemitism of most of europe so the people weren t as kind and funny and adorable as the characters in this film i almost hear the director saying this is who we were we were wonderful innocent funny people and it simply wasn t true europe of the s and s was a cesspool of hatred and prejudice a land that could only be described as hellish and demonic because the people themselves were that way partly as a result of economic difficulties the strength of the movie is in its heart and in its comedy one of my favorite moments is when poor milos who has already tried to kill himself because he thinks he will never be able to have sex like a normal man is instructed to find an older woman to help him learn and he asks a co worker what about your wife i could have fallen on the floor laughing all he meant was that the man s wife might know someone but it was so funny and to keep the joke going he later asks another friend what about your sister i happily give this film the highest rating of stars 
hiroshima mon amour reflects image and sound past and present the actual and the remembered his film was a bit puzzling but at the same time a compromise a promise a pledge to human society it is too daring by its conventional moral standards distinguished in the way it was done written made and executed alain resnais does not neglect the blast of hiroshima by wrapping it with a simple love affair hiroshima mon amour is about the fortitude of man with its mental and physical power alain resnais and his writer collaborator marguerite duras combined a love story with an anti bomb story they carry out the horror of hiroshima and the sorrow of a lost first love hiroshima is a tragedy that shocks us while the story of love in nevers makes us cry the story of nevers does not trivialize the story of hiroshima we gasp at the tragedy of hiroshima as we weep over the tragedy at nevers we contemplate a cosmic and a personal problem at the same time hiroshima mon amour is a kind of film that has great technical ability illustrating hypothesis plus fact there is a close up of emmanuelle riva who has just glanced at eiji okada asleep suddenly there is a brief flash cut of the body of a wounded young man lying in approximately the same position in another place resnais camera moves like a stream from the present to the past and back to the present it cuts back to riva s face and then back to okada asleep and in that split second the technique of the subliminal flash cut used to describe a character s state of mind is born this cut is the key to the film for it is the man whom she calls hiroshima who reminds her of her lover at nevers it is the tragedy of his race that reminds her of the small tragedy of her life this identification is carried through in the most neurotic moments of her recitative when she looks at the japanese and speaks to him as if he were her german lover of fourteen years before hiroshima mon amour reflects image and sound past and present the actual and the remembered hiroshima a city of neon and nevers a city of gray stone the personal and the cosmic a man and a woman concern for the individual and concern for mankind nice film especially for duras fans 
an insanely funny comedy for those with the right background this is a work of genius it is creative original funny and well done that being said it is probably not for everyone this wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from shakespeare s hamlet these are the stars of the show in hamlet they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with hamlet s melancholia they appear briefly and are gone the last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead they are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince in this work the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them the spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them as they discuss existential questions the tragedy of hamlet plays out around them it is quite funny but some background helps it helps a great deal if you are comfortable with elizabethan speech whole pieces are lifted from shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style it helps if you are familiar with hamlet that makes understanding the context easier it is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn its is fun 
great service we thought the tape was in excellent condition and the delivery service was very efficient

an archetypal western mood piece my darling clementine is easily one of ford s best westerns and quite certainly the best of all the wyatt earp films to most modern audiences the corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best presented by two motion pictures john ford s my darling clementine and john sturges gunfight at the o k corral ford makes a fine account of wyatt earp and doc holliday s legendary defeat of the clanton gang by now despite the film s climactic shoot out at the ok corral ford s talents lay less in action scenes than in playing endless variations on community rituals dances church meetings saloon brawls and funerals are utilized to define social hierarchies and relationships and to emphasize the role of tradition in the molding of america s heroic culture ford makes much of the visit of a pretty graceful lady named clementine searching for her presumably long lost love none other than the consumptive doc holliday now devoted to the bottle and hidden under a huge white handkerchief victor mature gives a touchy performance as the wild and reckless doc seeking death holliday sways between two kinds of women the eastern fair and respectable clementine carter cathy downs and the wild dark eyed dancing girl apache chihuahua linda darnell one of the sirens of the s whose rose attwilight looks seem to stimulate every cameraman earp the marshal of tombstone deliciously played by henry fonda and doc holliday track down the old man clanton walter brennan in one of his finest performances and his infamous four sons there is deviation on the way a revenge motive attributed to fonda and the jealous intervention of holliday s mexican mistress but the path is well and truly pointed to that challenge at the corral the action is firm nicely photographed in ford s favorite locale the rugged monument valley in northern arizona the story is also well told but the film will be always remembered for its fine sensations and curiously captivating moods this is ford indulging himself as was his habit but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with pure magic its a film of touches simple and beautiful ford often likes to slow his westerns down edged deeper into the american myth ford makes fonda sit precariously on the veranda adjusts his boots and balances himself while the world such as it is goes by fonda with quiet persuasive self confidence is the imperturbable peacemaker who walks a lady to church fonda shy and slow moving with delightful intonation of short words and an old world frontier concept of courtesy leads clementine in a delightful two step open air dance filmed in gloriously rich black and white my darling clementine is an archetypal western mood piece full of nostalgia for times gone by and crackling with memorable scenes and characterizations 
visual brain cartridge the best visual experience available and the sound may still be the best part i ve watched this over times and still find elements new to me i have bought this as gifts and have recommended it to very many who want a high end visual show 
almost perfect don t read this if you haven t seen the movie it took me more than a dozen views to start figuring out how everything was connected what s with the bugs what s that stickey stuff in his mainfraim how are his breakdowns and paranoia connected to his work and what is the quite white place he ends up in all the weird stuff is chaos slipping in between the seams chaos which he thinks he s fighting against at first max had a thread of a connection to the great infinite divine that which human beings are not wired to see he does see it though glimpses at first then the whole thing it almost kills him it s the classic iccarus story except that max survives and finds happiness at the end i disagree that the end is a cop out or incongruous it is the cumulation of every frame of the film it is the point ! he looks at the leaves blowing in the trees doesnt see a pattern can t see a pattern doesn t want to see a pattern and for the very first time he smiles why isn t it perfect i would have like to see more actual math the concepts are there but the details aren t not a big deal a beautiful mind put a lot of effort into putting real math into the plot and i like that also some of the details didn t connect for example the name of god letters long and the digit number his computer spits out before dying wouldn t necessarily be connected the system they explained indicated that different numbers of integers would represent a single letter in hebrew like would be a letter and would be different letter so the number of digits wouldn t really equal the number of letters darren kind of painted himself into a corner there he wisely chose not to make the punch line of the movie a complex number theory proof and i didn t even notice much less become annoyed about this detail until viewing up until then every time i saw it something different would finally make sense thus five stars i m inclined to give five stars to any movie that makes me think longer than the credits roll so this one should get many many more 
bad movie but well this is a very difficult movie to judge i would highly recommend it to any man who wants about amazingly sexy scenes seriously if you see those scenes they are burned in forever the movie itself well if you drink about beers after depriving yourself of sleep for hours it may seem un predictable betsey russell was a goddess for sure 
emotionally moving this movie seems to come right from the heart of angelina showing the plight of the parts of the world that many turn their heads to is enlightening the chemistry between angelina and clive was awesome i am now a huge clive owen fan i must say though i was not real happy with the ending am 
from angst to art vincent van gogh is wildly popular today in ways he could have never imagined his work is on post cards in massive coffee table books and on t shirts and he s even venerated in a pop song by don mclean thankfully this film by paul cox presents a more realistic view of van gogh reminding us of the artist s anguish and the very great difficulty he had coming to terms with his sadness and inadequacies cox shows van gogh s need to give shape to his suffering through art van gogh s life is rendered through his own words from his letters read by john hurt and through still imagery of the artist s sketches and paintings these still images are interspersed with gorgeous nature shots interiors and the occasional effective recreation of spaces that inhabit van gogh s paintings a really big bonus to this dvd is the interview with paul cox in which you see how cox s life somewhat parallels van gogh s in terms of childhood unhappiness loneliness and the need to express himself through imagery this interview will appeal especially to artists because it is so inspiring cox reminds the viewer what art is and why it is created and explains to us why there is so much mediocrity in film indeed cox s views on the need to rise above mediocrity are very similar to van gogh s 
don t look back if you are a dylan fan and don t own this then run out and buy or order now this is not to be missed don t look back shot by d a pennebaker who almost missed the chance to shoot the document actually when is partner leah was approached by albert grossman dylan s manager to see if they would be intresed in touring with dylan to shoot the documentary leah said whos bob dylan when pennebaker returned he was flabberasted but thank god for all the stubborn grossman returned and the contract or deal was hashed out over a hotel napkin true story with a small budget don t look back is a lean mean production of what the tour was really about but it s not all sex drugs rock n roll hardly in fact it shows dylan coming to terms with his own fame and how he negotiates this and how he negotiates his way through reporters various interviewers one famous scene with a science student who dylan toyed with in a game of cat and mouse and who he asked why should i want to know you what could you ever do for me at the time maybe dylan was right as it would turn out our young science student went on to form chrysalis records so that was a bit of a mistake dylan lacked some prescience here here we see dylan as a thoughtful philosophical young man so many terrific scenes here including a meeting wtih donovan who is a running theme and joke through the film and a tidbit of imformation it was donavan baez and dylan who wrote the cards you see in subterranean homesick blues the night before in a hotel room the better cards were done by donovan because he was more artistically inclined according to many reliable sources regardless the cards were done by all three dont look back was the first rockumentary in a real form that had ever been and pennebaker should be and has been applauded and rewarded for that the opening scene is simply of dylan holding his cards and the music of subterranean homesick blues what today we would call a music video pennebaker was the first to open a film in this style dlb is broken down into sections essentially we see dylan in concert dylan in hotel rooms with frinds notably baez and bob neuwirth who was his constant side kick that would change by scenes traveling scenes in green rooms and footage of fans and some of the towns but that s it travelperformancehotel roomsinterviewsgreen roomssome of the country though not much i don t want to give away too much perhaps one other compelling reason to buy this version is that it includes the book with all of the text and dialogue for every single shot of the film which is excellent for the true dylanologist or writer or journalist buy it then buy eat the document which is the folliwng year and note the diffrence a year makes this book if you like dylan is then positively for you sadi ranson polizzott 
poignant film about an intricate brother sister relationship this has become one of my favorite movies because of its realistic and honest portrayal of family life in fact it masterfully describes all kinds of relationships their intricacies and the ambiguosities that are often involved mark ruffalo is especially memorable delivering an entertaining sweet performance and he ll probably remind you of someone you know all around a great cast 
overlooked but very good i had forgotten just how enjoyable this little audie murphy western was until i recently purchased this handsome universal dvd release murphy in this venture is quotthe silver kid quot and his co star stephen mcnally actually steals the show the action is fast paced and believable the plot way above average there are shoot outs claim jumping and some humor thrown in audie has some droll lines universal international made a number of fine murphy westerns in the s into the mid s duel at silver creek is one of the better ones now let s hope that murphy s finest outing in the genre no name on the bullet and some of his other better films ride clear of diablo gunsmoke seven ways from sundown tumbleweeds get the nod from the engineers at universal 
technical difficulties shadow great dvd we have been fans of this movie since it was released on vhs years ago and were thrilled to find it finally available on dvd upon receiving it however we found that our primary dvd player had encoding problems with the sound it would play the soundtrack everywhere except on the feature film ! oddly our older backup dvd player had no trouble reading the whole disc i am given to understand this may be an issue with the first run of dvds as none of the replacements we received fixed the problem but newer pressings may work better be that as it may this movie is wonderful lots of non bloody action a la errol flynn and every swashbuckling flick from that era tongue in cheek jokes and lighthearted romance i would have few problems allowing a year old to watch this movie 
i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
scooby doo is awesome it was fun to watch the first episode of scooby doo high rise hair raiser on my computer as a download with my kids we go back and watch it from time to time i am glad that amazon gave me this free download so that i could try this feature

a boy and his mom based on supertoys last all summer long steven spielberg is the best movie director ever if not the greatest human being on our earth now for the review a i artificial intelligence was originally a project a long time project of director stanley kubrick dr strangelove eyes wide shut kubrick died before the project had progressed too far i knew this movie was dedicated to kubrick but the movie was just so very good i spent little time trying to discover any hidden meaning i was thinking this is the best movie i ve ever seen spielberg and crew do a wonderful job here haley joel osmet plays david an year old boy who is actually an advanced robot david is an experimental design equipped to learn and feel david is adopted into the family of monica and henry swinton frances o connor and sam robards they have an older son martin jake thomas who isn t always kind to his new brother the message isn t very subtle over and over and over and over david cries please make me a real boy in the end david is hugged by his mother monica and lies down with her the narrator saying for one day there was no martin no henry no doctor hobby only david and his mom 
watch this movie i have watched this movie more than just a few time there is just something about this movie that i like first of all i am fascinated with movies about nazis and conspiracies but the best part of this movie is michael caine this guy is magic to watch in it michael caine inherets billion from his nazi father to be used to make ammends to the people who were hurt during ww but the movie takes a spy mystery twist when killers are after michael caine and he keeps meeting new people he doesn t know if he should trust or not this is the type of movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end 
aerial gunner although dated by today s standards holy christopher ! the movie gives an accurate account of aerial gunnery training in wwii for the first hour of the minute film all aspects of gunnery training are portrayed i fully enjoyed the epic even though the characters end up in a b mitchell im partial to b liberators well worth the watch ! 
another great western from tnt and tom selleck this is the second of three outstanding westerns that tom selleck filmed for tnt between and selleck revisited his early louis l amour tv western roots with crossfire trail and also re teamed with director simon wincer who directed selleck s best big screen effort quigley down under as well as the all time classic western lonesome dove the result is an excellent film that while breaking no new ground contributes to the rich mythology and legacy of the american cowboy selleck plays rafe covington who at the beginning of the film promises a dying friend that he will take care of the friend s wife and ranch selleck and two partners set out to do just that and they add a new friend from the nearby town played by wilford brimley shortly after their arrival the film is predictable the widow is suspicious of rafe s motives the town bad guy has been wooing the widow in order to get at her land the bad guy hires a hit man to eliminate rafe and so on and yet even though the viewer can see right through the plot to the end of the film every element is so well handled that it is a pleasure to watch the movie i read several articles just before the film was released about the painstaking efforts made to have authentic costumes props sets etc and i must say that the filmmakers efforts certainly paid off the film is set in wyoming but was filmed in alberta canada which gives the film some of the best mountain vistas in a western since the real grand tetons were featured in shanethere is one small negative element in the film which is why i couldn t quite bring myself to rate it a and that is occasional strong profanity i realize that real cowboys weren t always the most genteel people in their society and i know that our modern society tolerates a lot of profanity however in a movie that continually emphasizes honor and integrity profanity seems unusually out of place there are dvd players and devices available that filter out profanity if you are like me then you can simply get such a player or device and still enjoy this first rate western 
a horror movie that strives for something more freaks is surprisingly still intriguing and unique years after it s original release the story is interesting and the acting fairly believable the short running time minutes is actually not much of a hindrance either as it simply allows the film to get down to business quickly all the characters are amazing to see on screen as most of them are real circus performers the human torso the pinheads two women with no arms a bearded woman the human skeleton and the list goes on even in this day and age seeing these people on scren is mesmerizing the dvd includes a great amount of special features including an hour long feauturette where several historians and circus performers discuss the impact of the movie and the give background on several characters in the film with the special features and the film itself combined this dvd is unmissable definitely worth checking out 
original nestor claymation cartoon this dvd has the original version of nestor the long eared chrismas donkey was the only show on the dvd i watched was great 
a welcome dvd i ve been looking forward to the dvd version of this film for ages it s funny and goes against form in showing the heartless capitalist as a moral likable person the proxy battle scene is one of my favorites in all of film with gregory peck and devito forcefully advocating different views on the purpose of a company i will go against popular opinion and say it is strange that devito s character falls madly in love with penelope miller s character she does a lousy job playing a sexy street smart lawyer and all the revealing dresses in the world couldn t cover that ineptitude thus the star review the dvd is a pleasant surprise the wide screen reveals what the cinematographer was going for with the short stocky devito strutting across the screen it s both comic and adds to the character seeing a little man who walks like a giant i saw this movie on my new dell lcd monitor and the colors are deep and beautiful with no noticeable dirt on the print an excellent transfer for an obscure movie nothing special in the way of special features but what do you expect 
enjoyable and fun i was skeptical when i first heard they were making a freddy vs jason movie the chances of getting it totally wrong seemed quite high after viewing the film however i was pleasantly surprised the plot makes a twisted kind of sense the performances by robert englund and ken kirzinger are inspired and enthusiastic and the special effects are top notchas a nightmare on elm street fan i was pleased that the movie seemed to fit the tone of previous nightmare movies i was however intrigued by the jason backstory and scenes since then i have become a fan of the friday the th pictures also if you like either franchise you will most likely enjoy freddy vs jason even though the final battle might not end the way you would prefer 
the indisputable kurosawa masterwork given worthy criterion treatment leave it to the criterion collection to give akira kurosawa s seminal masterpiece its due with this superb dvd package first renowned japanese film scholar donald richie provides a terrifically insightful commentary as he does on classics of other japanese genres yasujiro ozu s family drama early summer and k ichiwara s sun tribe melodrama crazed fruit second there is a seventeen minute excerpt about the film from a feature length documentary about its masterful cinematographer world of kazuo miyagawa who did similarly amazing work on kenji mizoguchi s ugetsu and ozu s floating weeds third if you choose to buy rather than rent the dvd there is a beautifully designed booklet with relevant excerpts from kurosawa s autobiography and the two short stories by ryunosuke akutagawa from which kurosawa and co writer shinobu hashimoto based their screenplay add a brief testimonial introduction by robert altman and this becomes one of the best of the criterion collection dvds set in feudal th century japan it is a far more intimate film than its vaunted reputation leads one to believe and quite brief at minutes ostensibly a courtroom drama the multi layered story focuses on the rape of a woman and the murder of her husband in a forest grove the events of the crimes are told from four different perspectives a swaggering bandit named tajmaru a woodcutter who witnesses the crime the wife and even the murdered husband by way of a medium each account unfolds in a distinct style an extravagant samurai adventure according to tajmaru the wife s melodramatic recollection as a victim a heroic martyr s tale from the dead husband in a blessedly economical style the contradictions in their accounts multiply as the story unfolds the framing device is the woodcutter s own flashback of the incident as told to a commoner but his version is far from the definitive one as he may have stolen a dagger from the crime scene kurosawa does such a brilliantly dexterous job in structuring the differing accounts that as the film progresses it becomes less about seeking the truth and more about the power and inevitable conflicts arising from everyone s sense of ego the only thing that becomes clear by the end is how individual perceptions shape reality and that the absolute truth is a myth miyagawa s expert camerawork is stellar in a way that raises the bar for subsequent cinema especially the vivid facial close ups of the main characters the sharp angles of the sun dappled forest scenes and the dramatically ink tinted raindrops a sterling cast has been assembled with kurosawa s muse toshiro mifune a youthfully feral presence as tajmaru masayuki mori and an especially vibrant machiko ky who later reunited in the ghostly ugetsu lend particular distinction to the couple ensnared by the tragic situation and the three legendary actors show impressive versatility in highlighting different aspects of their personalities in the various accounts takashi shimura who later starred in kurosawa s poignant ikuru is also superb as the woodcutter many filmmakers have since copied kurosawa s then daring narrative structure for example martin ritt s the outrage and edward zwick s courage under fire but none comes close to capturing the pervasive sense of ambiguity that makes this movie retain its initial power 
great rainy day fun this is the kind of movie that you can pop in on a lazy rainy day when you need to be lifted up a little it s a wonderful movie with a lot of great jokes and physcial humour kind of like mighty ducks but in my opinion a lot better with greatly funnier jokes the only thing keeping me from giving this a full five stars and a lot of you will think it s a stupid reason as do i but on the original vhs version there was a michigan j frog cartoon short before the movie this is absent on the dvd version that said the dvd is a lot better for many other reasons there are really cool bios about the people who helped invent football a theatrical trailer for the movie a really awesome special introduction by shawna waldron who played becky the icebox in the movie man she got really hot and a really fun commentary by the director one of the writers and shawna waldron if you have the chance you should get this dvd you can t beat such a low price for such a great movie 
how to be a part of real rock history without being a musician singer producer or someone in the music business answer make a movie as this one almost every serious rock fan and rock star must have seen this movie or if they haven t they had better see it before they go out and give another interview believe me there are bands and performers who still talk and give interviews like spinal tap did in this movie this movie is made for these guys like me if you have watched countless interviews of rockstars popstars and movie stars you cannot do without this classic the lead guitarist was my favourite i could give him an oscar for his brilliant performance if jimmy page used a bow on his guitar you must wait and see what the lead guitarist of spinal tap does these guys literally become gods by the way they poke fun at rockstars and their mannerisms particularly when it comes to giving interviews and playing live in fact this movie is so well made that it puts to shame serious rockumentaries made for real rockstars and bands one of the most famous lines from the movie apart from this one goes to is when the band is asked about one of their deceased members for which the band mates tell the interviewer played by the director rob reiner himself that the bandmate died of choking on vomit but they didn t know whose vomit ! hilarious and highly entertaining you ll love this dvd with tons of goodies which are worth the price of the dvd alone there is so much extra footage on the dvd that is seems like spinal tap the extras are as good as the original movie i couldn t stop laughing when the band goes to the zoo and near the chimps cage when they are talking their usual ridiculous lines they say things like chimps can t talk but can use computers and stuff you wonder how brilliantly the actors have come together to pull off something like this neatly packaged even the liner notes are funny almost every move made and every line spoken is worth being labelled funny one of the songs even caught my attention though the lyrics were insane a classic you cannot afford to miss 
love and marriage conscience and intolerance as far as films go almost the best movie i have ever seen well i am but i suspect it doesn t get any better than this the script filming acting etc are good but what makes the movie is the content the only movie i have seen that manages to portray romantic married love without being maudlin or stupid the relationship between more and his wife blows me away especially in the last scene when he is talking about custard and she s screaming and he calls her a lion it s not a typical movie characterization etc i couldn t believe it was a movie also it raises the issue of ones conscience and the whole issue of right wrong and to compromise or not to compromise the movie isn t a pat idealistic sass the king and do your thing be brave rather all manners of men are shown in contrast from driveling rich to fiery nonconformist will roper and all manners of men in between thomas more doesn t fit either catagory he s a politician not a scottish covenanter and neither is the moral just follow your conscience and defy authority at the beginning of the movie we see thomas more speak disparagingly of martin luther in favor of the corrupt authorities of the roman catholic church thomas more by his principles forced king henry to execute him instead of just assenting to the oath and muttering through his teeth like everyone else and the movie does the same it doesn t just let us conclude that it is right for everyone to follow their consciences thomas more does not simply champion freedom of conscience like henry the viii we are forced to make our own decision about thomas more was he some unbending deaf to rationalizations uncompromising to the death fanatic on par with jihadists who detonate in israel or is there really a truth out there while all of us are busy swearing the succession oath of our times and shaking our heads at misguided fanatics and live successfuly and die in our beds it makes me wonder 
the best version please make the dvd this is the best version of this story it is well directed and acted by the talented cast the collection of pirates is especially interesting with their seedy looks and various disfigurments my only complaint is that this version is not on dvd it is a great old time movie 
a simple masterpiece for a plot synopsis please read the amazon review i wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film as a longtime fan of both sam raimi of the evil dead series and bill paxton aliens twister i went to see this on opening night not many people can claim this i m sure because it was and is such a small film that received next to no marketing for shame this film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including blood simple and fargo both made by the cohen brothers film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers so i won t bother to get into that should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them i suggest you stop reading and immediately rent a simple plan if not keep reading and i will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant and why i hope you will take a look at it a simple plan is at its core about four people and underneath all the plot devices and twists it s about how they relate to one another notice i did t say characters because this film doesn t have actors simply delivering dialogue it s about people you get to know understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas sure finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device but the heart of this film is much simpler than that it s about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it and being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process thats what gives this film such depth you watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash and in the end it falls apart for two reasons the details and the human factor they say the devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime as for the human factor where greed is concerned people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person s greed while are unable satisfy their own in many respects this film is almost an homage to blood simple and fargo but in many ways i think it is superior i often draw the comparison by a scene which is both a simple plan and blood simple where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of and even afterwards after the emotional toll the has been taken once one evil act is committed another is sure to follow it s so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera frantically going over the details in their mind all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute bill paxton does this better than anyone he is such a likable man both in the film and in life that you can t help but feel sorry for the mess he has created his entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife that may make them all sound malicious but really the opposite is actually true they re all normal folks like we ve all seen a hundred times and in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in after all were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss what would you do but then again nothing is ever that simple 
nausiating i have never seen anything like what is contained in this documentary i am forever changed i bought the dvd to be enlightened about whatever it was the film was about i never thought it would have affected me the way it did it can not be stated enough how imperative it is that people see this film 
nothing civil in this war this movie shows the real life hell that was andersonville a prison camp that turned into a death camp not enough food water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there the south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them a well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa 
submarine creature comes after belle creature from the black lagoon is an extraordinary class b film ive seen it when it was first released to theaters in argentina yes i m that old the creature haunted me all over my pre teen years i ve just found this vhs copy and thoroughly enjoy it the original movie was filmed in d format unfortunately i wasn t able to see it under that layout however viewing it in d is a chilling experience the s was what we may call monsters decade this creature is one of the best of them all of course you shouldn t expect the realistic and or surrealistic feats that modern film technology enables this is a rubber creature yet impressive more so in scenes on ground environment the story is quite simple an archeologist finds a fossil hand protruding from a hill side in the amazonian territory he returns to civilization and obtains support for an expedition leaded by mark williams the main sponsor and ambitious entrepreneur the team is completed by scientist david reed and his also scientist fiance kay lawrence different circumstances lead the group into the black lagoon a natural paradise but with the gill man roaming free the creature is increasingly aggressive so action scenes underwater on the jungle or into the tiny ship proceed without respite the film has many outstanding features director jack arnold is very proficient delivering solid sci fi horror films such as it came from outer space the incredible shrinking man the present movie and its sequel imho the creature is his best play acting is very good with richard carlson and richard denning in the leading roles julia adams deserves a special mention outstanding legs and absolutely adorable in her white bathing suit performing an aquatic duo with the creature underwater scenes are great a strange mixture of realism and water balletit is a very good horror movie for all audiences reviewed by max yofre 
from excellent to so so to pretty bad this is a trio of short films each about minutes in length by three top directors martin scorese francis ford coppola and woody allen with the only thing in common being their nyc settings the scorese film is about an abstract painter nick nolte who is in love with his assistant or rather uses this love as inspiration for his work the coppola flick is about rich people and is the worst of the three the allen one which is the best of the lot is in the old allen style he plays a lawyer with an overbearing mother who hovers over the city like a ghost telling everyone his secrets she comes back to earth when he meets a girl just like her it s called oedipus wrecks and it s very funny the other two not so hot 
cajun spice this colorful and fast moving film from director jim mcbride about an only slightly corrupt cop in the big easy and the pretty assistant district attorney sent to investigate the department is filled with cajun spice and atmosphere the lines between right and wrong are blurred like a rainy windshield in this lightning paced and very sexy cop film dennis quaid gives a terrific performance as remy mcswain a second generation cop who sold out early on in his career accepting it as the norm but not letting it hinder him from doing his job when the prim but sexy ellen barkin arrives on the scene in the form of d a anne osborne he attempts to wine and dine his way out of trouble as the bodies start piling up in an apparent drug war the charged encounters between remy and the shy anne blend seamlessly with some very brutal crime scenes and a lot of new orleans music to propel this film at a breezy and very enjoyable pace when remy s own corruption is exposed their relationship becomes more complicated when he tampers with evidence and gets off but her comment to him that he is no longer one of the good guys causes him to take a serious look at himself when cops are discovered to be behind all the recent drug trouble the answers will hit far too close to home a very unique cop thriller that manages to maintain a light and breezy ambiance throughout this is one of the most memorable films of its kind its spicy flavor goes down easy and makes you crave more a supporting cast that includes ned beatty john goodman and lisa jane persky offer fine support in this very seductive and one of a kind film you must see recent events have added a melancholy tone to this flavorful cop film one can only hope after rebuilding that a new chapter will be written in the city s storied and colorful history this excellent film gives a real feel for what makes it what it is pick this one up today 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
grandfater for slasher flicks i love this movie this movie is an blue print for all the revenge horror movies we have now its a slasher movie with real characters most slasher movies have characters who are over the top with whatever the sterotype that movie character is and look like j crew models lol with the looks of the cast i can tell that the studio didnt do a tight cast call for the roles in this movie unlike most slasher movies i didnt want the whole cast to die even though sooner or later they would have to face their fate even wendy was a pretty tame mean girl compared to some of other b in the newer slasher movies they were actually likeable kids that happened to make one little mistake lol the ending sequence was one of the best and saddest i ever seen in horror movie ever even inched passed carrie main reason for that was one of the songs fade to black listen to the words and they actually follow the story line yes the soundtrack made this movie every time you hear music it fits that scene perfectly i wonder what would happen if you did the dance number that jamie did at your prom lol i just wish it comes on tv more i just ordered the dvd and i heard word that a remake of this classic is underway sometime coming up real soon 
excellent movie this is probably one of the best horror movies of it s time it is still scary today it s not bloody it doesn t need to be to scare you great movie 
un predictable i found this movie unpredictable even after reading the plot on the back of the box the acting is good and believable some of the scenes are designed to shock the execution of these scenes are frighteningly effective i watched this on a low resolution screen with a pair of small multimedia speakers on low volume but the scene at about minutes nearly stopped my heart if i had seen this in a theater i may not be here to tell you about it seriously if you even think you may have a heart condition you would be well advised to have a loved one screen this movie for you first my only criticism as mentioned by another reviewer is not enough information about them and their motivations to wrap my imagination around most young people can safely watch this movie with minimal parental input assuming they are old enough to know that the boogie man doesn t really exist refreshingly there is no sex although the main actor and actress who are barely acquainted do spend nights together one in separate rooms and one in the same bed and fully clothed 
the first fly s the fly is the original story of the version the version that most of the people know not as flashy as the david cronenberg s version but the original fly remains very intriguing the fly is more a mystery film than a thriller more storytelling oriented the fly is a very interesting movie it s really hard to ignore the essence of the film because the monster has human feelings and human fears you can t help but feel sorry for this unlucky scientist and his family since the very beginning this movie invites the viewer to watch as the story unfolds there is the unrecognizable body of a man murdered by his wife and to increase the mystery the woman is looking for a fly with a white head eventually we learn why she is desperately trying to catch that intriguing bug the fly has pretty decent special effects and makeup specially if we consider that this movie is almost years old and the final scene is very disturbing still it is a very shocking image the biggest achievement of this film is that it s able to involve the viewer deep inside the story the mystery and the characters emotions and feelings the fly is a very solid film specially if you like mystery or sci fi films 
mock on more than years old now and a little dated spinal tap is still loads of fun with the mockumentary gang including christopher guest and michael mckean who did the delightful best in show in every aspect of s and s rock music is lampooned surprisingly director interviewer rob reiner comes off a little flat but maybe that s just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters big bottom a sendup of fat bottomed girls one of my politically incorrect favorites the sophisticated sex farm and the controversial smell the glove ultimately released as tap s black album are among taps big hits 
a fast paced different type of thriller minutes is worth the money it probably will not be the number one dvd in your collection but you re sure to go back and watch it from time to time this film gives an interesting if not frightening look at the role mass media play in our country s daily life we don t think about it since we are living it but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today at the center of the movie s plot is a greedy slick breaking news style anchor who is given the gift of being the only personality in town to have the near realtime footage of a string of murders as they are being committed he has a moral pause only for a second before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world the rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them all in all not the best movie out there but worth the money 
this show is the funniest thing on tv right now i ve never watched any shows regularly on fx until this year when i happened to catch a double episode of it s always sunny in philadelphia about episodes into season i don t remember when i ve laughed so hard in the past few years this show is hysterical ! charlie day what can i say i dare say he is the funniest character on television case in point the episode hundred dollar baby the gang s walking home in the evening charlie mac dennis and dee when an apparent meth head tries to mug them charlie mac and dennis all run away knocking down dee to fend for herself intentionally or non intentionally you decide dee gets mugged and decides she s going to take some kind of boxercizing thing to learn how to defend herself but her dad frank played by danny devito pipes up and says if she wants to learn to defend herself she should learn from him being that he s a former boxer frankie fast hands she agrees in the meantime dennis and mac convince charlie to become an underground street fighter after attending one and realizing that all you really need is to be able to take a worse beating than the other guy mac asks dennis you know who can take a beating and they both instantly turn to each other and say charlie whats great about charlie is that he s usually up for anything as long as there s money or excitement in it and this is no exception back to dee at the gym she s approached by another woman who offers her some assistance in the form of so called performance enhancing supplements dee s now popping pills which charlie sees while accidentally catching her she doesn t know he saw her and now charlie is popping her pills i refuse to spoil the rest but rest assured that this is one of the funniest things you will see this year and the rest of the series is no exception i have yet to see an un funny character on this show but charlie steals the show almost every time charlie day is comedy gold 
an intense film that is undermined by a lousy ending plot details this opinion reveals major details about the movie s plot dario argento s opera was viewed by some as a sort of comeback effort after his film phenomena aka creepers garnered lukewarm reviews and failed to register with a lot of his fans a lot of fans really looked forward to opera since it got back to his giallo italian thrillers where most of the movie is shown from the killers point ofview showing his usually gloved hands roots and lacked some of the ridiculous elements of his insect thriller phenomena while opera is nowhere close to suspiria or deep red in terms of greatness i felt that it was an improvement over his last giallo s tenebre opera deals with a beautiful young opera singer who is starring in an extremely avant garde production of macbeth she ends up being stalked by an obsessed fan who ties her to a pole puts pins under her eyes so she ll gouge out her eyes if she tries to shut them tapes her mouth shut and murders people right in front of her in some very graphic and bloody ways the movie in some respects has a lot in common with phantom of the opera as is expected of a dario argento film opera is absolutely breathtaking visually his camera moves fluidly and the movie features some insane angles and shots the actual opera of macbeth in the movie is equally visually captivating dario has mentioned that he always wanted to do his own movie version of macbeth but wasn t able to for one reason or another so opera gave a chance to sort of have some fun with it the killings in the movie are also very graphic and bloody punctuated by some really bad heavy metal music the first murder in particular has a very gruesome shot of a knife being shoved through a man s neck and into his mouth i was also very impressed with the scene where a woman is killed while looking through a peep hole the killer shoots her through the head through the hole and the bullet continues out of the back of her skull striking the phone that s behind her dario is one of the few directors who can take extreme violence and turn it into something of dark beauty where the movie really is lacking is in some of the acting i noticed that actors will act great in one scene only to appear that they re sleepwalking through the next this is especially apparent in the young woman playing the lead the ending also was very poor and seemed out of place after watching the documentary of the making of the film on the recent anchor bay re release the filmmakers even admit that the ending didn t turn out the way that they were intending it to if the movie had ended minutes earlier it would have turned a good movie into a great one opera will probably go down as the last decent film that dario argento made he went on to make some terrible films like trauma the stendhal syndrome and the atrocious remake of phantom of the opera i haven t seen his latest film entitled sleepless but i ve heard that it s a return to his deep red roots whether it s any good is another question but i really like to think that dario has at least one more great film in him one can only hope !

a great pegan to the original nosferatu and a very original take at the same time the whole movie can be summed up in two words klaus kinski his take on the nosferatuvampire is one so removed from most vampire movies that it really is strikeing in its tone our vampire is one who has been one for so long that most if not all of the human qualities he had are long gone and he is little more than an animal like the rats he keeps and looks very much like he never lets you take your eyes off him once you meet him he looks alone and lost in the castle when we see him and the only time we see any life pun intended is when he see s harker s wife s picture and in the last scene he has with her ! if you get into it this tale will keep you glued to the set long after it ends ! a very good film and the transfer is great 
keep coming back to this one i was in when i was first introduced to callanetics over the last years i have done my share of tae bo aerobic traing running and weight training however i can trully say that callenetics gives you by far the fastest results this has always motivated me when i ve been in an exercise rut combining deep muscle positions and tiny prescise and powerful movements is the key to its success the best part is that it is a no impact exercise so it is great for people with back injuries see callanetics web site but let me warn you its a killer until you master the positions you will scream out loud and you will see and feel instant results try it you will not be sorry combine this with some cardio and some yoga and you will feel increadible in just days honestl 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
a classic of european films french director louis malle made in this one in my opinion his greatest work briefly and mainly this is the story of two kids in a catholic school during the german occupation of france as always different critics will pick up those themes that most interest him to me this was a film abouta childhood cruelty b coming of agec social classes as noted from the environment of a school d and religionnot in any particular order but all very interrelated also i d like to point out some interesting notes that caught my eye the education environment the relation between kids themselves and the kids and their teachers i was specially interested because of the contrast with today s us in the quality of education that was taught in france in the spirit of discipline respect hard word the underlining importance as usual in french films of books sure the french kids could be as naughty as us kids but at least they would read jules verne or arabian nights what do us kids read that s right nothing they don t know melville steinbeck jack london robert l stevenson in us public schools kids don t read anything they have the maid teachers read for them they still write on lined paper in college because they wouldn t be able to write straight a work of art even more because it is not an easy totell story this one and time practically flies while watching it i suggest showing it to your nearest specimen of teenager if he stands the whole movie he is probably a happy private school kid or a miserable public shool underachiever if he stands ten minutes only he can still live to be a senator or even president if he runs away at the beginning he is probably a normal kid and unfortunately the same applies to their parents a wonderful film 
interesting movie but this is another american remake of the original danish movie starring stellan skarsgard which is more interesting than this remake i always wonder why when hollywood does a remake they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place even though i give this remake stars mainly because al pacino and robin williams restrained themselves and that hollywood changed the ending check out the original i give the danish original stars

worth watching again and again rose red is one of those movies that stays with you long after it s over don t let the length of the movie almost hrs turn you off to watching it it s well worth the time to sit down and watch this brilliant masterpiece the cast was wonderfully chosen from nancy travis who plays dr joyce reardon the woman who becomes fasinated with a haunted mansion called rose red to the point of risking other peoples lives to prove to her boss and collegues that rose red truly is haunted to annie wheaton played by kimberly j brown who has the power to waken rose red from a deep sleep by using her mind to do if your a stephen king fan than you won t want to miss this and for the rest of you who aren t well give the movie a try anyway you won t be disappointed

an enjoyable movie i came across this name of the movie when i went to a deaf history tour at university of iowa library last feb otherwise i wouldn t have known about this movie i wrote down the name of the movie so i can find the movie to see it and came across amazon com that are selling one on dvd with closed captioned which was a plus since i know sign language it was very interesting to see a big change from the signs in the movie during to the same words comparing to now in i can see most of them are different and a couple of them like thank you are still the same i guess time have changed from oldfashioned signs to modernized and simple signs it would be interesting if i could talk to jane wyman herself in today s sign language and see if she can understand some or not i wonder if she knows some or have forgotten completely it was an enjoyable movie with excellent acting by jane wyman and lew ayres bless his heart i m sure i will watch the movie again later

satisfying noir melodrama dopwn onhisluck drifter dana andrews falls hard for sexy small town diner waitress linda darnell hard enough to marry and fleece local rich spinster alice faye but as in any good noir things don t go as planned when darnell turns up murdered local cop charles bickford turns up the heat and andrews finds himself ready to be framed this is moody noir at it s best bickford is violent and twisted darnell is gorgeous but callous with too many men hanging around faye is nice and sweet but tied to her older spinster sister anne revere and there s a lot of money fayes waiting to be had andrews is perfect as the troubled eric as he was as the troubled detective in preminger s laura he actually looks likes he s been knocked around but darnell is good reason to watch this also her stella is a beautiful hard luck dame waiting for her ship to come in in spades darnell was at her best playing tough girls a letter to three wives or hangover square are good examples but faye well she s good but i m not sure film noir was her arena i know this was supposed to be a departure for her from the fox musicals and she walked out when preminger cut her best scene s but still she was again playing a nice girl it would have been interesting if she had had darnell s part and vice versa nonetheless fallen angel is a great example of what film noir was right down to the david raksin score with the jukebox playing the moody song slowly to good effect the dvd print is wonderful thanks fox enjoy 
a plea from the great unwashed i endorse the comments of the previous reviewer and support his plea for a re release of big black s pig pile when pig pile the cd was released in australia you could buy the video for an extra amount since my grandmother had died some years earlier i had nothing to sell to raise the boodle so i had to make do with just the cd since i ve never been able to find the video again i ve regretted it ever since if the company responsible won t re release the pig pile video is there anyone out there who can find me a copy for the purposes of a review the cd at least is frighteningly awesome i have no doubt the video was anything less 
subtle comedic role really allows candy to shine after all this time i m glad to finally have this wonderful movie on dvd it was certainly worth the long wait john candy turns in a wonderful performance as chicago police officer danny muldoon in his late s and still living with his mother he tries to pursue a relationship with a young girl working as a makeup artist in a funeral home but his feisty irish mother won t seem to let go quite a charming story with a few jolts coming from danny s imagined fears of his mother being harmed when he s not there for her the way chicago is represented is hit ormiss possibly due to licensing issues for some of the more well known chicago images most notably the chicago policeman s uniform and the design of the chicago squad car but those flaws notwithstanding the movie still has a chicago feel to it there actually are still a few remaining store front funeral homes in chicago and of course the plentiful irish pubs are captured perfectly probably the unheralded star of the movie is old comiskey park which for years was the home of the chicago white sox the filming took place after the final baseball game was played there in and a few months before its fateful date with the wrecking ball and the first date picnic on the playing field was a wonderful and touching sendoff for the old park after going to many white sox games there since age it sure was nice to see the fireworks from the scoreboard one last time ! 
funny funnyfunny even though this is about years old it is extremely halarious i ve been waiting to see a good stand up comedy the first min is just one hilarious hit after another i love this guy 
all dogs go to heaven don bluth s film all dogs go to heaven is a smart movie in it s own way i agree with some out there that it does own a darkened tinge to it but none the less it s a good movie for most viewers i just especially love don bluth s traditional animation and movies including the secret of nimh and the land before time which were made all around the decade i personally think that was when don bluth s best and most memborable films were made though back to the subject this movie definetly stood out in my mind with it s cute songs but which could use more work and appear more in the movie like you can t keep a good dog down this song was the one with the main character charlie a german shephered and his loveable friend daschound itchy sing in the bar with refrences to gambling which in a dog s fantasy world rat races and subjects containing killing can be gestured to adults though it has it s light hearted happy goluck kiddy moments with the graceful whppet annabelle and charlie romping the the clouds of heaven and the little orphan who itchy and charlie take under ann marie s loveable moments with charlie and itchy carface and his sidekick whose name is forgotten by me are the nuisence of a villan who plot to kill charlie charlie who only takes care of and pretends to love ann marie in hopes to pay back carface with money owed so as he can live after time and instinces which the inseprible trio go through helps charlie to soon love the little girl i myself thought this movie was good if your looking for a movie with a few dark subjects and childish subjects then this mobie is for you though i don s really recommened it to any child under 
a big hit for the elementary school boys crowd we purchased this dvd for our friends son s th birthday he is obsessed with airplanes he usually fast forwards movies to get to any scene with a fighter jet this is his favorite movie so of course he loved the gift we haven t been able to find it locally for sale only for rent i would recommend this to anyone who has a son nephewetc who is into airplanes 
corny movie but a classic of sorts jewish boy rabbi gene wilder who can t make it in poland home gets sent to san francisco where the new jewish congregation needs a rabbi of course he has to get from the east coast to california not an easy task in those days enter harrison ford bank robber and fast gunslinger an unlikely duo make it across the continent to see wilder married to his bethrothed and ford as his best man a winner if you don t mind some schmaltz here and there quite entertaining especially and probably mostly if you are also jewish 
baseball metaphor for life this movie wasn t really at all about baseball but about the metaphor for life baseball is overall if you are looking for a film that is going to capture what baseball represents then this is it 
funny movie this is one of my favorite movies i ve watched it for years on cable and finally decided to buy the dvd it stars the great john candy and the late richard crenna it s a fun movie to watch ! 
the antidote to the american myth the is one of the best movies i have seen in years it has been described as a movie about a dysfunctional family but i disagree on an important level these people are us do all of us win all the time true in a sense everyone in the family is a loser they do not succeed in that quintessential american way the father isn t great at his job the mother complains because there isn t enough money the son is colorblind olive isn t pretty in that beauty contest kind of way the uncle is gay has lost a prestigious job and is unhappy in love and grandpa snorts cocaine to numb his pain these do not sound like unusual problems to me but together they do make for a lot of really funny and poignant moments fyi this is not a hollywood myth about the underdog winning the day i say yay aren t you tired of those i think the movie wants us to ask ourselves what the word loser means each person in little miss sunshine has failed in some important dream but are we so enraptured with the american myth of success that we would truly call this family dysfunctional the myth tells us that anybody can do anything as long as he or she believes hard enough i think the movie is saying that the myth is a dysfunctional myth the problem with these characters in the beginning is not that they have dreams but that they are afraid to fail failure in america is a dirty word if you can t succeed in america then where at the end of the movie although each character has failed in a significant way each is a winner in a deeper sense and they certainly do not come across to me as losers or as a dysfunctional family i think they finally are seeing some things clearly for the first time this is a movie filled with humor and humanity it is a wonderful antidote to a myth that would make us all feel like losers when things don t go our way i wish there were more movies like this and by the way i don t laugh easily at movies but i laughed so hard at the end of this movie that my glasses steamed up 
lighten up this movie is hilarious it is also what you expect it is not an oscar winning epic nor it is designed to be don t bash it for being silly it it what is is roll on the floor funny 
an international techno thriller jack ryan the hero of several of tom clancy s novels is back at it in this movie about terrorism and global nuclear war in during the arab israeli war a lone israeli pilot took off and flew toward the arab lines his cargo one nuclear bomb however the plane is shot down but somehow the bomb survived it is soon buried in the sand and left unnoticed for twenty nine years meanwhile trouble has been occuring in other parts of the world as well the president of russia mysteriously dies and a new president nemerov ciaran hinds takes power this move alerts the american cia especially director william cabot morgan freeman nemerov is known to be a wild card and many are unsure of his motives however jack ryan ben affleck isn t convinced about nemerov ryan wrote a paper about nemerov and he seems to think that he is more conservative in his views directed by president robert fowler james cromwell cabot and ryan are sent to russia to check on the status of their nuclear disarmament once there they are given a tour of a russian nuclear assembly plant many renowned russian scientists work there however three have mysteriously disappeared back in the middle east two men have managed to dig up the remains of the missing nuclear bomb they sell them to a man named olson colm feore who pays a mere for the bomb immediately the wheels are set in motion the three missing russian scientists and olson have devised a plan to construct their own nuclear bomb smuggle it back into the united states and detonate it at the super bowl the detonation would lead the united states to believe that due to the instability of the russian government under nemerov the russians would be blamed for the detonation both the united states and russia would destroy each other while the scientists and olson sat by and watched however ryan manages to put all of the pieces together and is on his way to baltimore when the bomb is detonated a huge mushroom cloud covers the city and many people are killed as expected president fowler immediately suspects that the russians are to blame and immediately orders a counter strike thus begins a tense game of international chess who will blink first can ryan arrive in time to stop world war iii or will he be too late i found this to be a very exciting and entertaining movie the story is thrilling and very well conceived the special effects are very good as well the attack on the american aircraft carrier was one of my favorite sequences of the film morgan freeman ben affleck and james cromwell give fine performances although i appreciated affleck s effort i still think alec baldwin the hunt for red october and harrison ford patriot games did a better job as jack ryan i recommend this very good movie although i haven t read the book yet i plan to soon to see how well the movie compares to it if you re a fan of techno thrillers then don t miss this one 
illuminating documentary run time was minutes a stellar documentary the download worked perfectly hope the review was helpful ty 
wonderful this is probably jackie chan s best movie it has it all action comic relief and a great story line highly recommended to all fans of jackie 
german with english subtitles version is better of the two versions i saw i preferred the german version with english subtitles garbo s performance as well as that of the supporting cast was more inspired i will keep looking for that version before i buy 
love atlantis i think this was a great spin off from stargate sg which was starting to get stale even though i love watching it still love being able to download them all just wish they d get updated quicker honestly when i left weeks ago i saw the last episode available and i ve missed the next

superior drama that shows how it s done one of the best things about this film is found in the details when judd hirsch as the patriarch of a family constantly on the run from the fbi throws a couple of vegetables to his son played by river phoenix the director sidney lumet doesn t use that old cut trick one hand throwing another hand catching he actually has river catch the stuff that s thrown to him when river plays the piano lumet doesn t cut away from the keyboard to show the actor s face then cut again to the sight of hands playing he shows river playing the piano it s a real pity river s not here anymore he had gallons of talent this is a film whose emotional base is rock solid because the characters are flesh and blood with real feelings warmth dignity fear and hope that give the story tremendous depth and substance one sidenote of interest the young actor who plays the younger son in the family jonas abry was coached for this film by my mother who is a children s acting coach he does a great job if i do say so myself ! everyone in the cast is fine but the two standouts are river phoenix and christine lahti as judd hirsch s wife she is not only perfectly cast but fits her role like a hand in a kid glove you can t see anyone else doing this as well maybe sissy spacek but this unique combination of toughness and warmth is not quite a spacek character nor is it quite a jodie foster character either it s lahti s role all the way and she s really great one of the best things about this dvd is that it s really inexpensive my advice is to buy it you can t do much better than this for solid american drama at a great dvd price highly recommended 
i thought you were dead snake plissken rules in this john carpenter kurt russel escape from new york has great action and subtle jokes john carpenter fans like i should see it the dvd has a minute documentry trailersa photo gallery two audio commenteries one from john and kurt which is one of my favorites in the john carpenter and kurt russel commentery series and more ! it s awwwwwwwwesome also see the thing and big trouble in little china see ya at the movies 
superb then and now my wife and i watched mccabe and mrs miller tonight some thirty four years after the first time it s all still fresh the mud and ugliness of a new town in turn of the century west the inarticulate missed connections of love between the two protagonists mccabe s isolation in the town he made and leonard cohen s weary soundtrack scoring it all despite many moments of humor there is still no doubt for a minute that this west is headed for a tragic ending and when it comes in a fortuitous snowstorm it is a brilliantly choreographed one onthree quarter hour showdown cold mountain s climax from a couple years ago is i now realize with this refreshed viewing of mccabe a pale carbon copy of altman s work nashville will always be my favorite altman but he was certainly in peak form here as well quibbles you ll strain your eyes and ears many of the scenes are shot very darkly and the soundtrack is frequently low and muddy 
i don t agree with the new yorker review at all this is a modern greek trajedy i m not a big film fan but this film reminds me why the medium is regarded the most important elements required to make this work are definatly present the chemistry between irons and binoche as well the chemistry between all the charactors a story of obsession and sex scandal and sex power and sex dizzing falls from grace and sex love and sex hate and sex sex and sex this was more exciting than most pornos i ve seen a stone cold drizzlely red hot and almost sickening tale of adultry and betrayal and the director is fully aware of this i saw this when it was new and wanted to se it again now in years after it was made and it took me a few video stores to find it i remember my girlfriend at the time jumping my bones like a madwoman for days after she saw it whew ! i wonder how juliet and jeremy are doing these days i could go on and on but this is an underrated classic this an existential story in the way irons charactor has gone along his life with too much success and power that has left him empty his son has had too much luck and success which has made him vulnerable the anna barton charactor has had too much trajedy which has made her reckless and opaque the wife is thoroughly human and doesn t deserve what she is left with i find this story surpringly plausable i love how irons charactor becomes basically an addict to sex with anna barton love is the drug and i need to score he looks at her with total mad lust this films shows the vulnerablity of success and power of being human subsitute iron s cabinet ministry wrangelings with eu policies in co as oppossed to ozone and this could come out today the charactor anna barton is the first one to really show a lack of restraint she just comes too close and lingers too long and doesn t do much at all to hide her attraction to irons charactor she s damaged goods and even tries to convey this but the men cant quite believe it enough she s too sexy to maddening and too good in the sack 
tex avery on dvd but not in the usa why is it that one of the undisputed grand masters of american animation does not have any of his work on dvd in the united states this is such an incomprehensible feat of omission by warner who owns the rights to practically al of his greatest work that i just can not get over it indeed a marvellous boxset with extra s of of his best cartoons has been issued by this studio but only in france they think of tex avery as a genius over there and so warners cashed in on his fame in the usa there seems to be the idea that nobody will buy a boxset of tex avery cartoons i guess in these days when every piece of trash that has ever appeared on tv or film gets a ultimate collection boxset the work of this genius these hilarious works that were so far ahead of their time get not even a nod in their own country 
mambo italiano nobody can send up the immigrant italian experience like an immigrant italian they spoof themselves so well because they tell the truth and the rest of us are afraid to be so truthful lest we wind up in the river wearing cement overshoes for example i remember joe dolce singing shaddap you face and so do you when this song was popular mamma had married into another italian family and we d be at the family owned pizzeria and we d all be drinking beer on tap and somebody would pop a quarter into the jukebox and we d all sing shaddap you face and hell i m not even italian this movie is absolutely hilarious we were watching this and just cracking up it was filmed in canada and even that was funny one of the main characters played by paul sorvino was upset because there are two americas the real one usa and the fake one canada they moved to canada from the old country because they didn t know any better great great movie oh you want more okay i got more right here what s worse than being a gay italian nothing ! fuggetaboutit seriously it s hard to believe this is only minutes they covered a lot of ground because they know it ain t new and i just want to use the word hilarious again 
you will love this movie the summer i killed my father i was years old with those opening words the film sets its mood from the very first second of its running time for the things to come the film has a visual and storytelling strength that will capture you immediately as movie starts and will not let loose until the end credits are over 
if this one doesn t touch you you re pure ice the film while admittedly not ringing true in spots via dialogue or circumstance is nonetheless engaging touching and emotionally draining some of the points it touches on are so dead on it s scary acting wise it s ted danson s high point he ll likely never top this performance but it s enough to leave the world even if he leaves acting tomorrow lemmon and dukakis are tremendous you ve read the plot in other reviews just see it and get ready for an emotional jolt 
i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
great quality there is a good reason you d want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality isn t very good it s streamed and the bitrate quality is low personally i want to watch survivor on my plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
apocalypse revealed folks the apocalypse is a retelling of the book of revelation as received by the apostle john produced by italian radio tv it is a very catholic movie as most of the consultants were catholic and at least one orthodox and it shows but it is not blatantly catholic so basically any christian will enjoy watching the movie you all know richard harris his filmography is quite extensive and includes the guns of navarone the bible titled the bible in the beginning in usa la bibbia in italy a man called horse and two harry potter movies the apocalypse is his last movie and he delivers a powerful performance as john the apostle there s something about his raspy voice which sounds old yet vital imbued with authority and compassion that moves the viewer to listen carefully all his actions seemed to very deliberate but not forced very natural without conceit what an actor actors vittoria belvedere and benjamin sadler play irene and valerius respectively in a supporting role theirs is the mandatory love affair that we often see in these kinds of movie but i assure that this affair is not vulgar nor does it eclipse the plot irene had met the apostle john when she was younger and now she s sent by the bishop of ephesus to track the apostle in order to ensure the authenticity of the apocalypse valerius is a roman officer whose parents were christians having been adopted by a roman general he infiltrates the ephesian church his mission being to locate the apostle john but he has second thoughts and well watch the movie the movie s strong points lie on its special effects they carry the story well without overwhelming it john tells the story and you see what he sees although the director rafaelle mertes threaded some current events into the movie to illustrate its prophetic aspects including scenes from to picture warhe does it without forcing the biblical text into modern fulfillments what the director achieves is a correspondence of ideas this is no rapture movie a la left behind the apocalypse is a part of the the bible collection produced by italian radio television this is the kind of movie that we must support i hope you watch i 
east of eden review the mivie is in fabulous condition picture and sound clear as a bell delighted to have it bestzena wiene 
real people human drama and feelings disregard for stereotypes great photography action with reaction and great lesson in self acceptance is but a few of the elements that makes this a great classic made me think of my social role and position in life just like crash did 
if only there were more episodes firefly is a fantastic series my wife and i watched the dvd set from and found ourselves rationing the episodes towards the end because we didn t want the series to be over great cast great plots great music i really can t say enough about this series i have never enjoyed a season of any show more than i enjoyed firefly and everyone i ve introduced to it has loved it as well 
an eye opener i don t think i ve ever just sat and watched a movie and got it quite like this maybe it s because every married couple goes through the feelings expressed in this film laura dern mark ruffalo naomi watts peter krause star as two couples whose relationships are rattled by adultery these two couples have very different relationships yet are looking for exactly the same thing jack ruffalo is a college professor married to terry dern terry loves jack but jack is falling in love with edith watts who is married to hank krause who doesn t love her but is attracted to terry jack and edith fall into an affair that causes more pain to each of them then to their respective partners watching jack and edith react to their mates after they ve just been with each other the tears the looks the concern in their eyes hank in the meantime is looking for someone to cure his boredom with his wife and terry may be that woman and since jack s guilt is tearing him apart he encourages terry and hank s relationship in order to justify is infidelity what jack never banked on was realizing the love he had for his wife and his children after his wife sleeps with hank jack is panged with regret and heartache as he watches his marriage fall apart the marriage he felt he was tired of but in actuality it s the only thing he wants and needs this movie is a wake up call for all of us who are falling out of love with our relationships our lives in general and the ones we share it with it s brilliantly scripted and acted and flows wonderfully delivering its point beautifully watts and dern are brilliant here and show so much feeling in all their words in all their actions honestly one of the best movie s i ve ever seen and one that will stay with me for all time 
profoundly disturbing one of the most truly despairing documentaries ever filmed this film chronicles the cruel exploitation and empty lives of eastern european teenage hustlers the boys are allowed to simply speak to the camera and their stories are harrowing and unflinching their narratives are intercut with an astonishingly frank interview with a director of teen porn films who eagerly recounts his abusive methods for soliciting performances while carving up cadavers in his part time job as coroner the documentary has a very cool feel to it it s a gritty unemotional glimpse at this slice of life white onwhite subtitles are somewhat difficult to read and music is slightly intrusive 
st is the best toy story is the best cg movie ever i love pixar i hope toy storey is as good as the first 
genius whether people like him or not there s no doubting that this man is a musical genius ! he started his career as a rock star aiming his music towards white teens but everyone of all races and ages was curious as to who this little man was when he realized how much attention he could get from people just by being different he figured why not try different things like movies if you re from the s then you have at least seen out of the three movies that were made and you owned at least one album i loved him then and still do today and i m not alone i ve been to his recent sold out concerts don t hate because he s different learn to embrace and appreciate the differences ! 
cary grant step up more than any other this was the film that made cary grant a certifiable star and vindicated his decision to free lance in hollywood rather than sign a studio contract his light hearted turn as the ghostly george kirby other wordly pal and helpmate to banker cosmo topper proved to be a box office hit and grant was shortly thereafter working with directors of the caliber of howard hawks george marshall and alfred hitchcock roland young does some fine reaction comedy here not easy remembering he was often reacting to an empty set and the effects were put in later 
ghosts ! witches ! pirates ! all around halloween fun disney comedy staple dean jones stars as steve walker the well grounded and highly principled new track coach for little godolphin college located all too unfortunately near the resting place of edward teach aka blackbeard the pirate ! coach walker arrives in the quaint harbor town coincidentally enough on the same night as a charity auction for the daughters of the buccaneers is being held to save their historic home from being turned into an upscale casino by local shady businessman silky seymour in an attempt to capture the favor of fellow faculty member jo anne baker suzanne pleshette and defy the threat making silky coach walker soon finds himself the owner of an antique bed warmer formerly the property of one of blackbeard s wives a vengeful witch who cast a spell over the old cutthroat to suspend his ghost in limbo until some shred of human decency could be found in his soul when steve discovers the witch s spell book and invokes the spirit of edward teach he quickly learns that finding decency in the rascally pirate will be no easy task but the pair concoct a scheme to use the college s struggling track team and the local gambling establishment to save the little old ladies and their mortgage and in turn save the soul of blackbeards ghost ! blackbeards ghost is one of those fantastic family laugh fests from the heyday of disney comedies dean jones is in top form as usual and his chemistry with suzanne pleshette is so strong that there s no wonder why disney paired the two so often always with fantastic results ! of course the real star of this film is the legendary peter ustinov whose mischievous teddy bear take on the bloodthirsty captain blackbeard makes this a comedy that can be watched over and over again ! though the high ideals of jones character seem to get left in the lurch in a film that saves the day through gambling and cheating at that it s all in good fun and only the bad guys get taken for a ride ! joby baker elsa lanchester and richard deacon round out the cast with terrific character performances for fans of old school disney comedy this is a five star affair this dvd edition on the other hand leaves much to be desired bringing the over all score down at least one notch there are no extras to be found and the film is presented in a disappointing full screen with plenty of picture flaws nevertheless the image is as watchable as it ever was on the disney channel and the movie itself is a necessity for any disney fanatic s film library you could wait for a better edition to come out in the future but i wouldn t hold my breath at the affordable price this film has recently dropped down too i recommend picking up a copy now who knows when a definitive version will be released besides with a ghost a witch s spell and pirate antics galore blackbeards ghost is a must for annual halloween season viewing at the very least 
darren mcgavin s and pete billingsley s best a fine film that recaptures that period well youll shoot your eye out how manytimes did ralphie hear that well worththe time to see any season of the year poor schwartz got blamed for everything ! ho ho ho

what your dvd library is missing enter the world of a talented poker player who puts his life savings on the line and makes a run at becoming a pro but for as good as he is he is not above heart wrenching losses and rock bottom circumstances but at the end is perhaps a fate that is bigger than his mistakes this movie beautifully depicts what it is to risk everything in order to do what one loves 
it was really funny it was really funny when snoopy was putting up the vine and the vine was fighting a little bit with snoopy the story was about sally and the whole peanuts gang making charlie brown s baseball field into a garden but charlie brown didn t understand what they were doing because he wasn t there

cyrano and depardieu with panache in a parisian theater where cyrano has just run off a portly mannered spouter of bad verse a man makes the error of noticing cyrano s nose why are you looking at my nose does it disgust you cyrano asks with dangerous politeness no not at is it soft and dangling i did not look at it the man protests and why did you not look at it cyrano persists sickened you did it is the color all wrong is it obscene not at all the man says looking for a way out why then do you criticize do you find it too large in size its terribly small miniscule the man stammers what was that cyrano glares is that an insult my nose is small then eh my nose sir is enormous ! cretinous moron a man ought to be proud of such an appendix a great nose may be an index of a great soul kind endowed with liberality and courage like mine you rat brained dunce unlike yours all rancid porridge it would be grotesque to fist your wretched mug so lacking as it is in pride genius the lyrical and picturesque in spark spunk in brief in nose ! cyrano gerard depardieu is a man with heart and spirit as large as his nose a man who loves deeply yet must love through another when roxane anne brochet his cousin whom he loves more than his life gives her heart to christian vincent perez he is so determined to bring her happiness that he provides the passionate words that this handsome young man whose brain is as thick as mutton will use to win her cyrano is convinced that his face will forever doom him to solitude much less enable him to speak his heart directly to roxane i can never be loved he says to le bret one of his few friends even by the ugliest my nose precedes me by fifteen minutes whom do i love it should be clear i love the prettiest far and near the finest the wittiest the sweetest the wisest yes roxane there will be years before roxane realizes she had loved the man whose words she loved not the man whose handsome face she saw cyrano is a swordsman a poet a soldier a playwright he uses words with as much skill as he uses his blade he ll fight a duel while reciting a poem he creates as he fights and at the end hit if someone is rash enough to comment on his nose he ll make a fool of the fop by describing all the comparisons a truly imaginative man would have used he will never bend the knee accept a sponsor praise a mediocrity or knuckle to authority none of that is for him what he wants is to sing dream laugh move on be alone have a choice have a watchful eye and a powerful voice wear my hat awry fight for a poem if i like and perhaps even die this version of cyrano features terrific production values with great attention to settings costume and style the story moves along with duels and battles love and lost love most of all it moves along on the language and on the situation of cyrano himself it s a french movie but the subtitles were written by anthony burgess the are soft and caressing pungent funny and sad at times they move so effortlessly into couplets that it s only after you ve read them that you realize how much they added to a scene depardieu is one of the great contemporary actors and he creates a riveting cyrano depardieu is a big man with thick shoulders and a deep chest no one would likely call him handsome he is a phenomenal actor however his cyrano is imposing as he strides along a cobblestone street in his red cloak and black plumed wide brimmed hat depardieu creates a cyrano easy to imagine you might be a little like or could be if you had cyrano s panache tragedy cyrano isn t but it s a wonderfully robust sad romantic melodrama the dvd from world films mgm looks fine to me it s not anamorphic there are no extras 
tortilla soup love this movie that s why i bought it and i love my customer service from amazon thanks guys and galssue sweene 
great movie my only regret is that the producers of this dvd did not made any extra features ! i would really liked to see some behind the scene features about this excellent movie 
good movie if not compared to book if you are a fan of the book girl you will probably not enjoy this movie the movie leaves out much of the detail in the book which presented a more together engrossing and character rich story if you can watch the movie as a separate entity from the book it is enjoyable the strong point of the film is the excellent cast of many indie film stars like selma blair portia de rossi from arrested development also has a role in the film the film still presents a coming of age story that doesn t take itself too seriously 
salsa riffic i just rented this movie without hearing anything about it i am a lover of foreign flicks to begin with especially anything the bbc films produce this film combines humor romance and the energetic salsa music together perfectly i was intrigued by all of the various characters and felt that they all blended together in perfect harmony i can t wait to find the soundtrack and keep it for my collection a great surprise and heartwarming film about romance and love and its many ways 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography

lit my candle not following the recent broadway scene very much i wasn t really aware of what a sensation rent was several years ago when it debuted i became more aware of it when it was satirized in the southpark picture team america and after my church intergenerational choir sang the show s theme song seasons of love then one of the kids that i worked with in a local musical said rent was one of his favorites so i was a first weekend attendee at the theatre the story is important as it depicts gays lesbians drag queens and drug addicts as real people struggling with life love and aids just like so called normal people being in the rock style the songs aren t necessarily toetappers that you end up whistling on the way out of the theatre though seasons of love comes close particularly if you ve sang it at least two dozen times and la vie boheme is a showstopper the plot is supposedly based on the opera of that name but overall the music is very exciting and integral to the story the cast moved almost en masse from broadway to hollywood wilson heredia a tony winner as drag queen angel should have contended for an oscar as supporting actor i ve read that there was some concern about mainstream hollywood director chris columbus home alone harry potter i and ii getting the job but i don t see that the picture suffered for it maybe some unconvincing special effects are the worst of it as a rock opera it takes some time to get used to having almost all the dialogue sung rather than spoken overall another solid four star film definitely recommended to fans of modern musicals to those in marginalized communities and to those with art in their souls ps afterwards i got hooked on the soundtrack cd for a few weeks months but that s another review 
the best martial arts movie ever what else could you expect from the belgian s buy hey jean claude at the premiere of cyborg you let me and my cousin in the rain you were stuck in brussels so i ll still owe you a signed poster this movie is what it s all about off course bruce lee was widely known but this one is trully magnificent the story is based on a true story the movements are very very athletic and beautifull to make it short this movie has it all more from this please instead of such stupid movies were chinese men make flips in once while throwing some stars on top off a bus for example this movie let s you see what it really is art ! 
greythorne great movie about radio stations how they should be christian slater was a great actor in movie 
anatomy of a hate crime long before the term was coined movie dvd transfer extras director edward dmytryk s stark hard hitting examination of a hate crime was way ahead of its time in and has lost neither its topicality nor its punch in the years since based on a richard brooks novel the brick foxhole about the senseless murder of a gay man the script dropped the book s sub theme of homophobia to focus on the more cinematically acceptable topic of anti semitism despite this concession to the production code what emerged was a mature pungent indictment of all crimes motivated by discrimination and blind hated that was nominated for five oscars best picture director adapted screenplay supporting actor robert ryan and supporting actress gloria grahame also deserving award consideration were top billed robert young arguably giving the best performance of his decades long career as a taciturn police detective and supporting actor robert mitchum as well as j roy hunt s masterful black and white cinematography the warner brothers dvd release of this classic film noir is in all honesty a major disappointment mainly because the film tovideo transfer is not up to their usual high standard of quality there is very distracting jump in one of the earlier scenes apparently caused by a break in the film which was subsequently spliced together by an amateur one or two scenes are unacceptably grainy and there is a flurry of horizontal visual snow toward the end of the movie surely such a key title deserved a little restorative work before being transferred to dvd ! thats a statement not a question furthermore the dvd does not include a theatrical trailer however it does contain a very informative snippet from an interview shown on tcm featuring director dmytryk reminiscing about the film s production there is also an audio commentary by film noir authorities james ursini and alain silver overall despite the inadequacies in the master print crossfire remains a must see film and therefore this dvd edition is definitely recommended 
superb movie i bought this dvd for research purposes i will be performing in promises promises the musical based on the apartment i am so glad i bought this dvd as this is a great film that s not just my opinion the apartment was nominated for academy awards and won including best picture and best director in this film will speak to you on many levels on one level it is an indictment of corporate politics and a condemnation of philandering executives on another level it is an examination of extramarital affairs and the sometimes dire consequences on another level it is a love story where a damsel in distress literally meets her white knight then again it is about people who fall into the abyss only to find redemption and the happiness they deserve it is about knowing what is right and finally finding the courage to do what is right the cinematography is great as is the lighting the setup is perfect we are shown the enormity of a life insurance company with its employees in the manhattan headquarters the shots of the teeming faceless humanity are fantastic the long shots of the endless office are fabulous and will make you appreciate black and white out of this morass we are asked to get to know people c c baxter jack lemmon fran kubelik shirley maclaine and j d sheldrake fred macmurray they are embroiled in a love triangle that will change all of their lives the late great jack lemmon is a wonderful c c chuck baxter lemmon was a dapper years of age when this film was made he wants to get ahead and he does so by selling himself out he loans his apartment to senior executives for their extramarital assignations they in turn promise to move him up the corporate ladder there is humor in this as baxter trys to juggle appointments with different execs but as in the rest of this film there is a pathos to it chuck has quite a thing for cute elevator operator fran played by a year old shirley maclaine she returns his innocent flirtations but for some reason keeps her distance maclaine is all sweetness and vulnerability so why won t she go out with chuck as it turns out fran has a boyfriend that boyfriend is the director of personnel j d sheldrake sheldrake is quite married and has slept with many women in the office including his secretary peggy olsen macmurray plays a wonderful cad he is not sleazy or oily he is able to continue stringing fran along until one fateful christmas eve i won t continue discussing the plot as you need to experience it as it unfolds while what happens next is not a huge leap of the imagination the skill of the actors and the sensitive direction make for fascinating viewing there are some great scenes in this film the pivotal christmas eve scene with sheldrake and fran will get you at a visceral level macmurray and maclaine shine here her with vulnerability and his meeting her vulnerability with incredible insensitivity brilliant lemmon shines in the discovery scene when he figures out that fran is involved with sheldrake sheldrake had borrowed the apartment for a rendezvous with fran and fran left her compact behind the compact had a broken mirror chuck not knowing who it belonged to returned it to sheldrake later at a christmas eve party fran loans her mirror to chuck who recognizes it lemmon communicated so many emotions with his face his voice and his body he was such an actor this movie is listed among the top movies of all time and it deserves a place on your shelf highly recommended 
all it takes is just a little heart and courage on your part well this was a random purchase on my part so i thought i was prepared for anything even girls hopping in front of a train simultaneously interestingly that wasn t the craziest part of the film a detective story with an almost rod serling twist or a thriller with a detective setting either way this was and interesting look at cinema in general and asian cinema in particular as long as digital blood doesn t bother you a growing trend in japanese film it s an interesting story that will entertain most audiences and inspire a few interesting conversations seriously watch this with some friends and see what discussions start up 
a feast for the eyes the mid s was a banner time for e m forster fans two of his novels a passage to india and this a room with a view were successfully and wonderfully adapted for the big screen howards end would come a few years later forster had a genius for developing characters and for showing the awesome and sometime awful complexities that arise when people interract james ivory thanks to a brilliant casting director had the right actors to bring these characters to life on the screen helen bonham carter maggie smith simon callow julian sands daniel day lewis etc what this permitted ivory to do was to focus on another equally important element in film making to give us something beautiful to look at the shots of a small engish village the lusty italian countryside the polish of an upper class english garden are nothing short of breathtaking it enhances the romance heightens the humor especially when an english minister decides to skinny dip with a few parishoners in a hysterical scene and convinces us that this was how life was for these remarkable characters one of the merchant ivorys best collaborations this dvd also comes with some insightful commentary and a unique look at e m forster s life i recommend it highly 
great show bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining 
lawn dogs prejudice hypocrisy and rationalising of immoral and violent behaviour are not merely american vices but common symptoms of all of us living in so called western civilization this film bitingly satirises such behaviour and reminds me that all of us come sadly short of our obligations to our fellow creatures sam rockwell and mischa barton supported by a strong cast bring this sad tale to life with great charm 
great if you teach us history best overall look at the s for students and the people interested in the s music is right with the times and the film is vintage fred allen is the the host and his old radio voice is right out of the jazz age ! 
good this is a good movie i love the patsy cline stpry and i like all the music in i 
excellent movie not a big box office success this is really a very good movie great performances from michelle pfeiffer colin firth jessica lange and jason robards 
karloff shines in duo role karloff once again shows us what an incredible actor he was in playing both brothers in this classic well thought out story and good supporting cast make this one a classic rivals universal s monster movies of the same era 
this is the one my favorite peckinpah film yeah you heard me right this is the one where we can clearly perceive sam flying of the deep end and yet it is still some kind of graceful ugly crazy masterpiece there are jarring deliberate shifts in tone from lyrical to brutal and ugly to downright surreal it s willfully sloppy at times with some shots that don t match at all and some of the worst day for night you ve ever seen at one point that may actually be the fault of mgm s dvd i don t know none of that matters a whit this is a surprisingly heartfelt pitch black comedy with an outstanding squirrelly performance by warren oates and isela vega is awesome alfredo is a road movie from hell funny horrifying and totally captivating and i don t just mean so baditsgood this is an important film and i love every stinkin minute of it but if you have pedestrian tastes stay away this is probably the fullest cinematic expression of the bitter and abrasive side of peckinpah s personality that is so well documented most people don t seem to know how to take it take it as a beautiful reckless personal horror film that is laceratingly funny one minute and just lacerating the next the final image says it all ps the scene between kristofferson and vega seems to confuse a lot of people as it should but you might want to listen to the words of the song kristofferson s partner is singing to oates in the background as this scene plays out there is a possible reading of this scene that i think a lot of people might not have picked up on it s also interesting in light of the particular paranoia that made it hard for any woman to be in a relationship with sam 
a must for any manson fan this video features all of the marilyn manson music videos from portrait of an american family to mechanical animals plus some extra concert footage my favorite video off ma is quotcoma white quot which is a reenactment of the jfk assassinations quotlong hard road out of hell quot which was featured on the spawn soundtrack features manson nude ! the videos off quotantichrist superstar quot are very eye catching quotman that you fear quot and quotthe beautiful people quot are my favorites quotsweet dreams quot shows manson and the band in a dilapidated house quotdope hat quot is my favorite video because it s basically a really demented version of willy wonka amp the chocolate factory quotlunchboxquot is an old video which shows the band playing in a roller rink the concert footage is a real treat too i hope they re release this on dvd with videos from quotholy wood quot and quotgolden age of grotesque quot added to it 
chaplin has not dated i couldn t disagree more with the reviewer who bashes charlie for being dated humour doesn t date only the context that surrounds it this dvd contains some supremely witty and charming comedy anybody who is looking to buy it must already be a silent film fan so is familiar with the medium the film quality is superb and i thoroughly recommend it 
love and dominance takuya loves satsuki and satsuki loves takuya at least until she finds out that that what takuya really loves is being dominated and abused by her moonlight whispers lies somewhere between the piano teacher and secretary as a thoughtful look at how a relationship based on domination can develop between two people but it is presented in a manner unlike the two films i just mentioned all three share a wide eyed fascination with the subject but where secretary approaches it with humor and the piano teacher with horror moonlight whispers is out to tell a genuine love story it helps that the two characters are high school students who appear almost entirely innocent about the subject of love at the beginning of the film the blurb on the box says that watching moonlight whispers is like watching a very kinky episode of dawsons creek and it s right only i d hasten to add that the film is better written and acted than the sitcom not that i ever watched that show ever i first saw this film at the new york s m film festival i was there for the films not the s m thank you and despite containing very little of what we generally think of as s m it was an audience favorite it s worth your attention 
brilliant but unwatchable i saw this at what i believe was it s european premiere in edinburgh it was like watching a beautifully choreographed car crash sublime yet horrifying it s heart is black it casts no light mike leigh s vision of the human condition is here presented in so bleak a light that it can only corrode anyone who watches it i recall that it made me feel physically sick at the time and i described it as the antithesis of everything i believe art should be yet it is undoubtebly art it is a work of brilliance which does not shine a black black diamond yet i still believe it should never have been made most people live in hope this film denies that whilst there are some who recognise the nihilistic world it presents most will be shocked by it and it s greatest disservice is presenting the world as it is to a majority which will deny it and live their squinting lives not seeing because of it a work of too too accurate brillance 
new legend of shaolin offers enough novel action and cute humor to satisfy for us guys the female thief is cute sexy funny standout scene for me is when jet as a bodyguard is courted by her when she tries to measure him up for some badly needed new clothing the kid also deserves mention evidently this kid is the real deal and his fight with other kids is a somewhat rare sight fight scenes are more stylised than actual but they are choreographed with style toward the end there is a big surprise when the vile baddie shows up he is really different and nasty as hell you won t believe what he has and jet has a real challenge to beat him overall should please anyone who likes the feudal period 
my dvd video the dvd that i purchased was in excellent conditiona and the price was very reasonable 
an emotional powerhouse this film is a truly epic experience the type of film that one doesn t see too much of anymore these days based on an autobiographical novel by stefanie zweig it concerns the redlich family one of the lucky few families to leave nazi germany before it was too late walter the father saw the writing on the wall and left for kenya in sending for his wife jettel and daughter regina six months later in normally one doesn t think of refugees from the nazis as escaping to anyplace in africa particularly not kenya although there was actually a fairly substantial jewish community in nairobi by the time wwii broke out along with other refugees such as the redlichs living in more isolated and less developed areas of the nation jettel is a bit of a jewish german princess at the beginning of the film and has a very hard time adjusting to life in kenya she believes living on the farm in rongai will be temporary and was so unaware of the reality waiting for her that she brought her fine china and bought an evening gown instead of something more practical like a refrigerator before she left home her character proves to be the most interesting the one who goes through the most development becoming a very different person by the end of the film walter in contrast has a sea change in attitude in the opposite direction and wants to return to germany after the war instead of staying in kenya which has become like a home to his family and saved their lives they also have to deal with their troubled marriage they d apparently begun having some problems before they left germany but their marriage is really put to the test in kenya particularly while walter is away in the british army for four years and jettel is left to tend the farm young regina is also a fascinating character being so young she adjusts quickly to life in kenya although like her parents doesn t ever really fully come to think of it as home she has a number of different cultures to deal with the german culture she left behind and the one she has a connection to via her parents the native kenyan culture and the swahili language and the british culture at the colonial school she attends though most of this film shows us kenya through the eyes of people living far away from so called civilisation this was still a time when most of africa was under colonial rule a much different africa than it is today her relationship with owuor the native who acts as a servant to her family is incredibly moving and touching one of the finest aspects of this film unlike her mother she never has any hesitation about or resistance to befriending the natives she doesn t care that their skin is dark and hers is light they re just other children she has fun with and who like being with her the same way that she instantly takes to owuor seeing him as a kind man who warmly welcomes her to kenya on the surface this is a historical film but the true themes are about the nature of home alienation self discovery finding oneself loss and how sometimes the least likely place can become a refuge and come to feel almost like home over time what is the meaning of the word home does a refugee or immigrant ever really completely feel at home in a foreign land and will these people ever really feel at home anywhere again whether they remain in kenya return to germany or start a new life in an entirely new place it s also a nice change of pace to see a wwii era film set in africa to see how the war affected the native peoples the dominating british colonialists and the refugees like the redlichs the soundtrack is also incredibly gorgeous as is the natural scenery there are also a wealth of bonus features the audio commentary is top notch revealing such interesting facts as how walter s voice was actually done by the popular actor herbert knaup but for two undubbed scenes one of which is conducted entirely in english because it was felt that merab ninidze the true actor had too strong of a georgian accent and that silas kereti who plays regina s friend jogona as a young adult was initially very hesitant about performing in one of the tribal ceremonies in the film because it was being done by another tribe and he thought that taking part would mean that he were becoming a member of this other tribe other extras are deleted scenes with optional commentary a making of featurette interviews with merab ninidze juliane khler jettel matthias habich walter ssskind a character who immigrated to kenya before the redlichs sidide onyulu owuor and caroline link the director peter herrmann the producer and stefanie zweig score selections a storyboard comparison for the locust scene trailers and a photo montage with commentary at almost two and a half hours long and three hours long originally this is a truly epic picture a real emotional powerhouse all of the characters are developed so well and acted so masterfully that one grows to feel as though one actually knows them has gone on this powerful life changing journey along with them it s also not just another wwii movie since the setting and themes are so very different from the usual ones far from just another movie this one makes the viewer think and feel instead of just being entertaining or delivering a lot of high tech special effects it s a shame more films in hollywood aren t as masterfully crafted as this wonderful highly recommended german film 
theme song information the original theme song for this movie is time and tide it was written and performed by paul williams and is available on one of his cd collections i believe that the theme song was changed in when the movie was re released as a tv movie i don t know why they changed the song i still remember some of the words and i haven t seen the movie since whats that old saying if it ain t broke don t fix it hope that helps ajmcgil 
great african martial arts great before i give my review i would just like to inform people that capoeria is african not brazilian the slaves started this art back in angola and when they were transported to brazil that s when it became popularized the reason that there are so many kicks is because the slaves practiced this art while their hands were in shackles they disguised it as a dance so their slave masters wouldn t know what they were doing thats why the movements resemble a dance this movie was great the action the story everything was great mark dacascos teaches inner city youths some of which are trouble makers the art of capoeria at first they resist but as time goes on they become interested and start to train hard and pay close attention to what they re being taught some change their tough guy ways while others just remain the same bottomline a great movie the first time i ve ever heard of or even seen capoeria was when i saw this movie on television about years ago the movements agility kicks are just flat out amazing me personally i train in jeet kune do and muay thai and filipino kali but i can tell you that i love to watch capoeria being performed and watching this movie is definitely a treat for any martial arts fan or any martial artist regardless of what style he she practices 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version

a crusade of good taste the holy grail of science fiction brilliantly scripted and marvelously acted sci fi movie based on the all time favorite pc game the intense combination of an intergalactic war story and a classic shakespearian love tale makes this movie an adrenaline pumping tears jerker of historical proportion mankind can traverse the darkest depths of space it will always bring along its emotions the kilrathi character depth is the secret of its success diminishing the personality of hamlet to a superficial cartoon character while the lines spoken by the kilrathi have the rhythm of a swiss watch it is the depth of their meanings that truly fascinates only repeated viewing can reveal the many layers of its message once discovered your will agree that this is what takes wing commander beyond the level of the greatest classics of hollywood or even global cinema the people of the future will divide human history in the pre wing commander era or the dark age and the post wing commander era when humanity finally became enlightened by this masterpiece and its powerful message at a lower level you are bound to forget the part of your life that was spent wasted really before you could become a wittness yourself to the brillance that is wing commander oscars may be awarded for artistry in film making only a nobel prize or several could do justice to the levels of excellence reached by wing commander this production will no doubt be remembered by the many generations to come as a turning point in movie making how many ages hence shall thsi our lofty scene be acted over its message when correctly interpreted will influence society as only the holy bible may have done before be ready to experience never feltbefore emotions as you watch this hallmark movie over and over again it will leave its tracks on your soul tractor pull deep tracks

for john and olivia ok i agree with other viewers this move is not the best in world i also feel it is not the worst either i will never give up that the chemistry between john and olivia is awesome they did it in grease why is it not in this move i think the acting between them made the movie at least good if not a masterpiece i agree the story line and the direction could be much better the bottom line in this movie is that john and olivia has the charm to make romance on the big screen the whole freezing and rewinding thing gets a little out of hand it is a fantasy that is a make believe story if you will a fantasy like xanadu that turned into a cult classic failed at the box office i think it is a fun a light movie that is goofy and cool at the same time john and olivia made the acting work were direction was short i think they should try another romance comedy type movie again i think with a great director and producer it just might be something really worth seeing john is still in the spotlight with movies olivia just cut a new album called grace and gratitude that she just finished a tour early in dec i agree with others the soundtrack is great as well

classic s thriller one of the decade s best this movie is yet another of the untold examples for why i d like to pound the heads of the movie production execs when is this going to be released on dvd okay enough ranting i ll get to the specifics a small time hood macklin robert duvall is released from prison just in time to find out a couple of killers shot his brother the bank they robbed was run by the syndicate its the classic crime deal gone wrong scenario when a killer comes after him also he ruthlessly sets out for revenge with the aid of his friend cody joe don baker this thriller moves with contiguous action there aren t any unnecessary scenes i credit the fast paced direction of john flynn who also co wrote the excellent script this was only his third movie as a director and believe me this doesn t contain any of the corny stuff found in out to justice duvall makes a convincing ruthless thug its a scary portrayal there are solid performances all around from an excellent supporting cast consisting not only of the aforementioned joe don baker a gorgeous sheree north cameo in addition to three of hollywood s late great legendary icons of the classic film noir days elisha cook jr maltese falcon the big sleep the gangster et al jane greer out of the past the big steal and in his last film appearance the great robert ryan the set up the racket et al now if the production companies would stop putting out retarded remakes s s shows hello and give us restored classics like this one our saturday nite s would always be fly criterion please save us

best horror movie i ve seen in a long time freddy krueger robert englund is been dead for years in the real world and the dream world since freddy is literally in hell and forgotten in the real world freddy has a plan to bring back crystal lake serial killer jason voorhees ken kirzinger to life in the real world freddy thinks that by bringing jason back to life to bring fear on elm street and making teenagers believe in freddy again he can break loose from hell and restart his killing spree however now that jason is a instant killing machine he isn t willing to step aside and with a terrified town in the middle freddy has to find a way to kill jason by going in his dreams before jason takes over elm street a scared teenager monica keena finds a way to bring freddy to reality from her dreams thus pitching freddy and jason into a horrific and bloody showdown this film is directed by ronny yu bride with white hair bride of chucky formula who made an entertaining spin off to the a nightmare on elm street and friday the th series robert englund who played freddy krueger for the th time reprises his role as freddy and it seems that he had a blast making this film kirzinger replaced kane hodder hodder originally played jason in the last four films and adapts to his new role beautifully kirzinger is excellent as the new jason sean s cunnigham who produced and directed the original friday the th is back producing this silly but larger than life epic the film also stars jason ritter jasons father the late john ritter worked with yu in bride of chucky kelly rowland r b singer from the group destinys child lochlyn murno scary movie chris marquette the girl next door and katherine isabelle ginger snaps trilogy dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen transfer also in pan scan and an superb dolby digital expanded surround sound dvd has an ingraining commentary track by the director and actors englund and kirzinger disc two has deleted scenes with without commentary many behind the scenes featurettes music video ill nino how can i live which in my opinion is worth the price of the dvd hidden features dvd rom content and more the film has an strong music score by greame revell the crow dark city pitch black that pays tribute to the a nightmare on elm street and friday the th this film ended being a box office smash for the studio new line cinema extremely entertaining for the fans of both freddy and jason watch for new line topper robert shaye one of the executive producers of the film as the principal in a cameo appearance great gory fun all the way 
warm and fuzzy this one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even booth has a heart well more so than we already know the ending got me i got misty over it enjoy with someone you love 
a fun and by no means unfortunate adaptation a delightful little movie based on a series of delightful little children s stories with maybe a bit more bite than the average fare of course it won t be for everyone a series of unfortunate events is about the three baudelaire orphans who are shuttled from foster home to foster home pursued by the evil count olaf a laughable over thetop villain determined to capture the orphans family fortune this movie takes the first three novels of the series purported to be books in all plus an autobiography of the author and blends them wonderfully into one tale sticking the nd and rd into the middle of the first book it brings the tales to life with delightful scenery and excellent casting jim carrey brings olaf to life and yes he is overacting but he is absolutely true to the character in the books he is perfect in his role billy connolly and meryl streep have great turns as well if you re a fan of these books you likely won t be disappointed if you ve never read them you may like this movie too just know that it s a little stylized and over the top in the end it s a lot of fun and not that s not such an unfortunate thing in a film 
why isn t this movie on dvd it s been a long time since i ve seen this movie but it was cute and funny as well as fantastical i never thought the cyndi lauper jeff goldblum combo would have worked but their cooky combo made a lovable eccentricity and bond between their characters as well as with peter falk lots of humor in this movie depsite the subject revolving around two psychics headed for south america chased by other psychics trying to beat them there surprisingly infused in this cooky caper are some short poignant heart warming interludes with peter falk as well as some neat special effects bombed at the box office and did okay on cable but a much underrated story with its own quirky charm 
beautifully done but doesn t go deep enough purely on artistic merit i would award this film an on a scale of ten most documentaries dream of achieving this kind of artistic impression as for its command of the subject it struggles too hard to be passive in many ways that passivity is charming because it gives a chance to show what sort of person the real fred leuchter is but in turn it glances over the holocaust denial issue the portrait of fred a leuchter that comes through is a gullible and misguided man who strive to his utmost to achieve acceptance from his peers his rabid desire for acceptance is made clear by the fact that he himself pronounces his last name as if it were loocher but ernst zundel pronounces it loikter in the german sense when it comes down to the video leuchter made for zundel we find him adopting zundel s pronunciation of his own name in the end leuchter succumbs to the siren song of the holocaust deniers who bestow upon him all the respect and admiration of any university professor one feels almost sorry for such a man when his highly unpopular views ends up costing him what little success he had achieved i don t personally believe fred leuchter actually means to be the spokesperson of holocaust denial but he finds it too difficult to give up the position he has achieved through that at one point when he is asked if he could reconsider his views on the holocaust his only reply is no i m beyond that now the one thing this video portrays is the man who is virtually lost in the muddle of holocaust deniers and their opponents the former manipulate him and the latter villify him leuchter is really just a mediocre and unfortunate man who has been thoroughly exploited by people who really don t care about him as anything more than a way to further their own racist agenda to get more aquainted with the real issues behind the leuchter report i would recommend truth prevails demolishing holocaust denial the end of the leuchter report by shelly shapiro which is a collection of articles on the leuchter report written by several of the interviewees in this film among others 
everyone can be a year old boy there aren t enough movies like this these days family oriented centered actually adventure with edutainmental attributes great cast great score great albeit goofy story people give this film too much credit for being implausible which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true if you re looking for adventure and fun thrilling characters in a family film this is it 
one of the top ten films ever made this movie tugs at your heart strings in a completely honest way the movie does not patronise or make pathetic the boy hero who has to endure it is the very opposite of saccharine glop it is a profoundly optimistic and yet realistic movie the movie is peppered with memorable eccentric and kind characters 
perfect love makes perfection in all i find it odd that when reviewing the reviews of this film that people seem to either give it perfect or abysmal scores the dichotomy of opinion is probably a direct result of the skill and immense power of leconte s images especially those that his chosen actress affords us leconte is a master and quite possibly the greatest living auteur currently making films his movies often contain a refreshing difficulty that gives one hope that images still mean something that film is still worthy of being explicated that someone still cares enough to think that much without being overly clever such as the coens and anderson i shouldn t say still i should say is and will be as leconte is on a different level than any who has ever worked including kieslowski the master of images i enjoy how leconte has said that although it was his second period piece he approached the film as if that had nothing to do with it learning from ridicule i should point that out i have no problem with ridicule and the fact that it is a period piece has a great deal to do with the presentation but i can see what he meant like i said i enjoy the statement but i should also point out i m a jerk binoche and auteuil are two of my favorite actors and this film shows them at their virtuosic best they deliver amazing performances of a truly passionate couple who both hold unconditional love for the other which in itself contains ultimate trust of decision and character possibly more auteuil s for binoche s but the sympathy generated by his character fuels her as an equally sharing partner making any difference negligible there is a third character neel but he is there only to accentuate the relationship between the other two the movie quite simply is about unconditional love and what it means to love unconditionally there is a subplot of equal merits mainly concerning neel about the belief in redemption and what it truly means to believe in redemption in short it is about the consequences of action through belief more so out of the love for another than those of moral ground or stance some people are not willing to accept the belief that actions can or should occur solely out of sympathy for another some people will never allow themselves to love unconditionally some people will not understand or even like this film binoche deserves a prize that doesn t yet exist for her most exquisite performance leconte deserves recognition for what he has done and what he has given us with this film certainly one of the best i have ever seen 
nostalgic when an individual buys a movie it is in order to watch it several times unless one is a reseller so to buy a comedy to think that one will laugh at the same jokes a hundered times is foolish the movie is enjoyable due to its excellent cast and quirky humor there is nothing overbearing about the movie which is a nice departure from the majority of movies out there two cast members are now gone the plot is simple the quirks are clever enjoy every now and again when you miss the s its actors and the style of thought you had when you were a kid 
laughoutloud nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the cheech and chong movies with the exception of the coriscan brothers aside from realizing i shouldn t have been watching those movies in my pre teen days i realized how well done they are most amazing to me was that they held up one after the other feeling not repetitive though each of them is rather episodic most impressive was chong s direction he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer star who has enough power to direct clearly he took this role quite seriously the movies of course are not serious i rarely laugh out loud in movies these days but i did at least a half dozen times in each of these the characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable and the films all he more watchable 
overhyped but good the seventh seal ingmar bergman so i ve finally seen the seventh seal ingmar bergman s most famous film and perhaps one of the most famous films ever created and i have to say while i found it interesting well written and occasionally amusing i ended up thinking that my view of the film was somewhat tainted by the constant praise to which the film is subjected in other words that it didn t live up to a level of hype that perhaps no movie with the possible exception of course of the immortal night of the lepus could ever hope to the much abbreviated version of the plot known to most that antonius block a knight max von sydow returned from the crusades challenges death bengt ekerot fresh from playing hamlet to a game of chess is hopelessly simplified there is a great deal more to this film and anyone expecting ninety six minutes of chess playing is probably going to be quite confused block and his squire jons bergman regular gunnar bjornstrand have recently gotten back from a decade away and block is eager to return home to his wife karin inga landre still alive and working as she nears the age of eighty death appears to block and the game of chess is proposed as a way for block to buy time to get back home the chess match acts almost as a framing piece the journey s the thing here block and jons as fine a team as don quixote and sancho panza have learned to suffer one another over the past decade like an old married couple jons however an avowed and vocal atheist has noticed his lord s crisis of faith and spends much of the film subtly manipulating block to his way of thinking block meanwhile is seeing more than enough in a swedish countryside ravished by the black plague to make him think that god may in fact be dead the clergy to be found in the film are all bombastic buffoons and a good number of them are outright evil block and jons in their own ways are determined to do right by the few souls they encounter in contrast to the clergy s scope which is the entire country or so it would seem the two of them gather a small band together all headed for block s castle the chess game unfolds piecemeal as the journey continues there is certainly much to be praised about this movie the acting is good all around von sydow overplays a bit but one gets the idea that that was stage direction straight from bergman the camerawork is well done the sound is a bit rough but i m more than willing to blame that on the transfer or my particular copy of the disc where the film usually treads the line of greatness is in bergman s understated script block s understatement and death s civility are excellently counterpointed by jons brashness an enjoyable film and an exceptionally good one while it may be all that you might still have to buy the bag of chips yourself 
great movie my son who turned nine was just thrilled with the concept of being called to active service from a video game being a gamer himself i m sure he dreams about being called to duty lots of action imagination for a little boy 
very funny comedy awful video quality this was cary grant s first screwball comedy and legend has it that the actor was unsure that he could pull off comedy and asked the director of the film leo mccarey to release him well it s good that grant eventually changed his mind because he turned out to be one of the silver screen s most gifted comedians the awful truth teams him with the equally gifted irene dunne in a remarriage comedy that i personally like a lot better than the philadelphia story jerry grant and lucy dunne two immature spoiled filthy rich brats divorce amid a flurry of suspicions of adultery they have a custody fight over their dog mr smith lucy finds love with a dull mama s boy ralph bellamy and grant dates a socialite but of course lucy and jerry can t get over each other and each schemes to win the other back of the grant screwball comedies i think his girl friday is probably his best it has a better script wonderful ad libbed lines better direction and better performance by grant who by then was a master of the screwball comedy his sarcasm zaniness and impeccable timing had been honed to perfection but the awful truth has an awful lot of charm and humor the movie is full of funny moments like jerry smugly watching as lucy is pushed into dancing in a restaurant lucy s dancing is of course painfully bad grant and dunne have great chemistry and both of them manage to seem silly and lovable at the same time and the has one of the sexiest endings in movie history watch the movie and you ll see what i mean unfortunately the awful truth was not given proper treatment in this dvd the picture quality is awful full of white specks and other visual distortions there are no extras either odd since other columbia releases it happened one night his girl friday have been released in very nice dvd packages 
unique plot this a film where two men meet on the train and one suggests that they exchange murders as i do not want to spoil it for those who have not seen it yet i will not elaborate i will say this though this film is a masterpiece with a very unique plot and masterly directed by alfred hitchcock the actors give a excellent perfomance especially the antihero bruno do not miss it 
just plain funny you must suspend normal belief when you watch this like i do when i watch a musical performance in a musical you must stop and go with the flow when someone breaks into song well in buckaroo you just have to go with it with jason and the argonauts flash gordon etc if you wanted to enjoy them you had to kinda just say ok i ll accept this it has lots of actors you will recognize 
kind friendly and enjoyable sure this movie has some bad acting and low budget animation but i don t care about that the plot was very good it was touching and the end was very pleasing the only thing that bugs me is that it hardly seems like it s a sequal to the original because the draogn is young and doesn t have the wisdom of draco from the original but it is still good the movie is probably meant for a younger audience but i think people of all ages would enjoy this movie 
really good truckin movie maximum overdrive is not the greatest horror film to the average movie critic but if u r like me u will enjoy this i love it because i am into truck driving for a reason i dont really know but i am and so i liked the trucking side to this film so if ur like me and like trucking then u will love this movie but if u are just looking for a good scare from a horror flick this may not be ur best chioce in my opinion next to smokey and the bandit it is the best trucking movie ever 
you yanks can t do this stuff mind i could nt get it on dvd or vhs back in so called enlightened europe ! i had to go to america to buy it and then chip my machine in order to even play it ! thankfully the u k is not really europe ! or ever will be it s an especially pagan island archipelago and that s what gives us the advantage when it comes to making films like this wicker man et al it seems you fellows value the diversity of uk europe better than we do ken russell in general and this movie in particular explores the viewers cranium for hang ups if you have any he ll find them and if does find them it s your problem not his all the actors are brilliant in this movie but the essential ingredient is amanda donohoe in this she is delicious ! it may well be she inspired the movie it just would nt have worked with anyone else she may really be the reincarnated snake gods priestess she does it so well and you never know on those pagan islands what strange forces well up ken has successfully managed to hijack a couple of u k national icons into the bargain namely concorde and the e type jag that s quite a feat for a budget movie if i might summarise by hijacking one of your phrases i heard over here ken gives you great bang for your buck so please enjoy this classic movie with your great big goggle eyes 
has a charming attraction with a meaningful message a woman is frustrated with many important aspects of her life her own father and her husband don t care for her and she s seems to be lost in life until a window of opportunity comes from outer space she experiences a ray of light from a spaceship that changes her life to be more the person she wants to be but there happens to be a dangerous side effect she grows to be feet tall she uses her new found power to discipline the people that did her wrong particularly her unfaithful husband i enjoyed the special effects especially when the giant is roaming the town s buildings with hoards of screaming people in the streets this is a remake from the original of the same name 
the road i love this film everyone must see it at least once just as everyone should taste ice cream or smell a bouquet of fresh lilies ofthevalley or fall in love ya gotta see this la strada is part of a body of work that has at its core a thread of autobiographical sentiment so powerful and mysterious that scholars are still dissecting his films frame by frame although fellini says in the criterion collection dvd extrai have no message for humanity i am sorry we still believe that if we can decode the images stories fantasies and dreams of fellini s experience imagination we will find profound truths certainly the experience of viewing a fellini film has proven to be worthwhile to a vast audience across geographic linguistic and cultural boundaries and over time there s something to this fellini guy s stuff but what the heck is it i think fellini s films are distillations of beauty humor dreams pathos nightmares and the pleasure and pain of living when fellini insists that he doesn t have a message he is probably right he s not trying to sell ideas he is only trying to give form to his thoughts and dreams and nightmares and fantasies and experiences and memories the result is something we would call art for those of us susceptible to the aesthetic fellini is a master la strada is a film with a neorealist core the ravaged countryside the long lonely vistas of fields the sea and the faces of poverty belong in large part to the neorealist post war films that look unflinchingly at harsh realities of a war torn italy the circus which here forms an environment is the backdrop for individuals who reveal their characters in a tragic landscape reading the film artist s biography fellini on fellini reveals his attitude toward the auguste clown and the imperious white clown their relationships power structures and the circus as a metaphor for life itself in the film maker concludes with an acceptance of life as a circus a parade of clowns lovers friends and associates who enter the spotlight and give resolution to the film who is to argue i think life is like a circus pretty often there is the reality of being in the circus and behind the illusions and there is the reality of being an observor and outside flip this into any social situation and watch it fit we develop compassion and sympathy for the main characters giulietta massina is luminous as the female protagonist clown a kind of auguste figure according to fellini s own breakdown of character types she is the butt of jokes is the lost soul the sidekick to the white clown and the hapless confused child anthony quinn is oh sodark as zampano the strongman a kind of white clown authority figure who blusters bosses bullies and frightens in the end of the film a man cries at the edge of the sea he is broken lost has betrayed the trust of an innocent has little reason to believe his own soul may be saved except for the fact that his tears are falling his recognition of the sanctity of life comes late 
a pure western with a great score gunfight at the o k corral derives from one of the most celebrated shoot outs in western history in tombstone arizona on october the semi legendary confrontation had made of wyatt earp and doc holliday men of exceptional quality gunfight at the o k corral has some of the sturges virtues but not all it doesn t however disappoint when it comes to the crunch the gunfight itself this is magnificently staged it probably equals anything that law and order movies have produced in set piece battles the film also focuses on the friendship between earp and holliday and the good will of two different kinds of men earp is an honest lawman with authority and holliday a gambler with a real big hate for the law the two characters are powerful strong and at the same time compassionate with respect and dignity holliday s character as the black sheep is much more interesting than the straight marshal who is at the same time the lawman the judge and the jury the main assets of the motion picture are lancaster and douglas two great stars conscious of their potentialities with excellent ability douglas is impressing and brilliant as the troubled sick doc holliday and lancaster is confident solid and likable as wyatt earp the mirror scene in the beginning of the film is great douglas cool and steady is ready for action observing carefully in the mirror the sharp feature and narrow steely eyes of lee van cleef who is so anxious to kill him with a small gun hidden in his left boot fine performances by a first class cast heighten the interest rhonda fleming is ravishing as the redhead lady gambler jo van fleet is very effective as the jealous lady torn between ringo and holliday earl holliman is good as the naive deputy who picks up the hardware as soon as the cowboys hit town john ireland is unforgettable with his slight stoop and menacing walk lyle bettger is strong as ike clanton the organizer of the toughest bunch of gunslingers dennis hopper is difficult and rebellious as the young clanton who can t take the advice of the marshal and jack elam is threatening as the tall and lean man with an evil leer dimitri tiomkin s great score back up the gunfight at the o k corral a pure western magnificently photographed by charles lang in vistavision and technicolor john ireland has been twice on the losing side of the corral incident the first time as billy clanton in john ford s my darling clementine 
wizards is truly magical if you like swords andsorcery films this one is for you throw in just a little bit of technology and you have the makings of a well crafted movie one even tends to lose the sense that this is a cartoon this is due in part to the fact that ralph bakshi is famous for cartooning over live actors this makes for a very believable movie without going into detail i wouldn t want to spoil your fun by telling you too much heh heh the title comes from the battle between too wizards brothers one good one irretrievably evil and the methods they employ to achieve their separate ends and the ending of the film is a surprise in itself if i were you i d buy a copy of this before they re all gone you don t want to resort to renting this fine movie when you could own it now do you 
surprisingly good i thought that supernatural would just be another sci fi thriller but then i started watching it and was surprised to discover that there is real plot line and character development i think this show is wonderful and would recommend it to everyone 
a lot of fun i m a big fan at the serie and i enjoyed it agai 
one of the best jason flicks out of all the endless and undying jason films this is one of the few in the series that actually provides some scares regardless of the relentless predictibility jason never dies dumb blondes run out the back door instead of the front door like they should the car ignition won t work at all the right times women make obnoxious screams when they re hiding just to merely say jason i m here yatta yattayatta one interesting scene obviously i m a male in my prime when i say this is when two lovers are humping to s rock music in the back of a camper the camper is jumping up and down i think a majority of heterosexual men when watching that scene are left thinking how come my girl doesn t do that to me these cheesy slasher horror films of the s genre don t have much merit in the categories of acting skills realistic gore or physical animation but for some kinky sex scenes without overtly pervasive pornographic content of playboy along with some horrific surprises it proves to be a nice viewing for a couple that have been dating steadily so grab your popcorn and your hormones remember the same hormones and chemicals in our bodies that regulate sexuality also regulate aggression fear anxiety and happiness testosterone oxytocine adrenaline etc so when you combine all of these elements into an hour and a half of screen interactions of this caliber then it proves to be quite an opportunity for some foreplay and imagination 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography

a must see my th grade government teacher showed our class this film and we were all hooked if you have ever been in a room of thirty some teenagers you know that its hard to get their attention and keep them quiet so really if a bunch of teenagers enjoyed this movie everyone should consider giving it a chance it might not be as action packed as some of the movies out today such as blocks but it s gonna keep your attention so do yourself a favor and atleast rent it you might find yourself coming back to buy it

my all time fave as i put tombstone in my list of top favorite movies it wound up at the top of the list i m typically not one for viewing movies of this length as usually they will linger and loose my interest tombstone moves along at a great pace and every scene offers attention grabbing excitement i m also not one for watching a movie more than once unless of course i really really enjoy it then it may not be more than twice i own tombstone on dvd and have watched it over times since it s release ! the cast is superb the entire cast ! the intensity of the direction in unmatched by any western prior to or since

captains courageous this film is well done and spencer tracy shows what a superb actor he was 
no title another movie with sniffling and kleenex tom hanks as i foresaw in big is absolutely superb another comic like robin williams and bill murray with marvelous depths and yet the movie is not really about a man with aids as all the critics say it should be and then berate it because it isn t it s about society s reaction to gays and aids a much broader subject on that scale it delivers well we don t need detail scenes of tom hanks and his lover or his facing the disease or any other of the nitty gritty the critics said was lacking i think they missed the point entirely washington was society and his slow progression from homophobia to understanding is what demme is trying to say to the audience and increasingly i am thinking we should be out there living life helping people instead of watching them on a two dimensional screen maybe movies really distance us from life instead of imparting more knowledge 
ambition makes the man in this film directed by akira kurosawa lord washizu toshiro mifune and lord miki akira kubo encounter a spirit in a maze like forest that prophesies great things for the two comrades the former will someday rule the imposing spider s web castle and the latter will take his friend s position as commander of the first fortress even beyond that the spirit predicts that miki s son will one day succeed washizu as the master of spider s web castle although the two men are initially reluctant to trust the spirit s words preliminary parts of the prophecy come to pass thus setting into motion a bloody chain of events that explores the differences between active and passive destiny lady asaji isuzu yamada washizu s scheming wife prods her husband to seize the reigns of power at any cost she insists that washizu s only restraint is his own ambition and that heaven itself had preordained his rise here of course is where the trouble begins asaji is initially convinced of the legitimacy of the spirit s words and points out to her husband that without his doing anything part of the prophecy had come to pass she then declares that washizu must take the next step of killing the great lord in order to fulfill his destiny and yet there is an obvious question that arises at this point mikis son skeptical of the prospect of his succession to the throne of spider s web castle tells his father that the spirit s prophecy is only coming true because he and washizu took it upon themselves to make it so was it fate or was it a series of man made coincidences asaji paradoxically takes both views as she becomes enraged at the thought of miki s son and his posterity being the ones to benefit most from washizu s deeds now discounting the inevitability of the spirit s words asaji demands that washizu put an end to miki and his son to clear the way for their own unborn child will washizu trust the spirit and remain passive or will he actively take matters into his own hand will he succeed in rebuffing the spirit and shaping his own destiny or will he fail and fulfill the prophecy anyway the film itself is excellently done it doesn t get much better than mifune and kurosawa working together and as with most criterion collection dvds this one is filled with extras my favorite feature is the two separate english language subtitlings the first is a bit more literary and not quite as literal im so clever sometimes the second is more conservative and stays closer to a truly accurate translation compare these sentences he has imbibed too freely as opposed to he has had too much wine because this is a period drama the first feels more appropriate to me especially since the status based honorifics of japanese culture san sama dono etc generally lend themselves to older modes of the english language when translating them the more lyrical translation can be a bit much at times however so i can certainly understand why someone would be inclined to prefer the more accurate one though i was not particularly enthusiastic about the price tag of this film i was satisfied with the results highly recommended to all those with a penchant for high quality cinema 
bob dylan vs donovan this dvd was a fascinating view into the life of the greatest song and dance man of all time the music video of subterranean homesick blues is humorously primitive but none the less captivating and enthralling after watching this movie i will never throw glass out of a window or wear a dylan shirt to a donovan concert again if you like bob you will love this dvd it is a true necessity to any self proclaimed dylan fan it s worth the money to see bob and his manager make fun of donovan the tension is hysterical i also recommend to any dylan followers to buy his book chronicles pt it s so well written i began to wonder if bob missed his calling with that one but then i remembered he released at least albums worth seriously leaving your seat right now and buying but none the less he is also an excellent writer as for any folk fans out there i also recommend buying the newport folk festival dvd artists including but not limited to bob dylan donovan joan baez odetta buffy sainte marie johnny cash peter paul and mary and many more are shown performing at this infamous gathering this including comments and footage of the crowds builds a feeling of unity that has quickly diminished in this overly unappreciative world buy it and you ll long to be there i guarantee it 
incredible symbiose between music and images a regard on our crazy lifestyle that will surely make you think and reflect if you have the chance to watch this powerful film you willremember it forever i saw it o years ago and i cant forget this movie or the amazing music of philip glass trully inspiring 
a fun movie i saw this movie years ago and always remebered it as a fan of errol flynn and other great swashbucklers i totally appreciated the tounge incheek storyline this was one of robert shaw s last pictures a great actor who died too soon genvieve bujold was never lovlier and peter boyles evil count durant is a perfect villan a great film if you like adventure sword fights and comedy 
scared me away from the bathtub when i was this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the s cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny but it didn t detract from the film glad i bought it 
slow paced slice of s americana the ice storm is a startling look at america and how lost so many people parents children neighbors etc became during this transitional time the free love of the s spill over into the and somethings of a sleepy connecticut community and runs smack into the dysfunctional family of ben and elena hood kevin kline and joan allen ben is having an affair with his neighbors wife janey carver sigourney weaver aliens and the boredom they both feel during their love making is palpable they want something different to happen but what that something is remains unobtainable and the two s lackadaisical attitudes toward sex family and the times seep into their everyday lives even into their spouses and children bens wife elena gets caught shoplifting from the local pharmacy janey s husband jim goes away on long business trips and returns with funks of depression because of what he witnesses going on in his family the children of ben and janey are also settling into this bizarre behavior some of them explore sexuality in often strange ways or run out into storms and play on ice covered roads others blow things up with m firecrackers or smoke pot and drink to numb themselves out but all of these people s lives will change in an unalterable way during one evening an ice storm has hit and the cold outside bashes against the cold each character feels inside some will live some will die and others will never be the same the attention to detail on the s in director ang lee s movie is astounding the sweater vest outfits paneled station wagons and boxy homes were excellently filmed you can also feel the dark undercurrent running through the characters lives the grayish landscape cinematography against the quiet homes that harbor secrets the cast was absolutely perfect too kevin kline one of my favorite actors sigourney weaver joan allen elijah wood tobey maguire katie holmes christina ricci and jamey sheridan all pull in stunning performances having gushed over how well done the movie was i do have to comment on its pacing if you thought sideways was snail like this movie may make you feel as though grass could grow faster director ang lee has had some serious success in hollywood as of late brokeback mountain but this earlier work is an excellent way to see how he s grown in the intervening years 
one of the best movies ever a cult classic i consider the plot the actors the acting the special effects and believability to be all top notch grade a quality i never tire of watching this movie whenever i flip through channels and see it on i have to stop and watch it the cast is hot the inuendoes are cool it has a range of emotions for years i thought the games came after the movie and was surpised to find out there were games of the same name there is a good mix of seasoned experienced actors and medium tonew ones and the general tone is serious believable punctuated with joy and sadness and suspense it is hard not to cry during a couple parts when someone dies or is rejected because of their religion even though they try to hide it and i have even seen it soooo many times and still shed a tear when someone nice gets picked on in the movie the loyalty and sacrifice evident in the film is uplifting and inspiring it s one you get mad or frustrating if u miss the beginning not because it is hard to catch up or follow because it is pretty easy to follow but beacause if you mis the beginning then you know have missed some good opening scenes and a few bits of detail that only add to the beauty of this tapestry this is an ultimate classic good one that far outshines starship troopers any day of the week i think they should have made a sequal and they probably should advertise those games i found all but one or of them on sale to try out awesome can t wait definitely a movie you might want to watch every few months like the breakfast club or one of the star wars movies or star trek beautifully conceived and executed this movie makes you feel like you are there and a part of the great desperate mission to save earth suspenseful parts and ending too excellent script acting and emotions i can t believe someone would not like it 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
great narrative what is remarkable is what a cohesive story this truly comprehensive bio of thb makes as all documentarians do burns clearly had to help along trace out the narrative thread but the brilliance of this particular film is that the story of it just seems to emerge on its own also the story of thb s death is particularly moving the entire film is a great intro to thb and is accessible for any audience even those who feel distanced from the aloof world of art will really enjoy this film this film opened my eyes to actually appreciate art previously i was turned off completely by what i saw and indeed often still see as pretension summary the film traces thb s childhood and early training his time of formal training in europe and life in ny after that thb rejected the elitist world of the ny art scene and instead went back to missouri and became one of the triumvirate of american regionalists john stueart curry and grant wood were the other two fyi gw painted american gothic the most famous american painting of a farmer and his daughter though most people think it s his wife anyway thb s work is in much the same vein americana in his work thb tried to capture america and all its ambivalences that s why i say it s honest though critics might say he was too pollyannaish i would disagree and i think you will after seeing this film i cannot recommend this film enough anyone who is interested in the concept of america you know the optimism hope dream nightmare utopia distopia democratic promise dark underbelly all the contradictory impulses within the myth of america will find this a vital part of that dialogue 
other people s money very good copy of the original movie the movie itself is a classic situational comedy about our comtemporary business world danny devito brings his classic irreverant character to the screen with all of the style you have come to expect from him this is a timeless must have movie 
this animated series led to so much the novels movies and three other series as a fan of the original star trek series i was overjoyed when the animated series aired and sad when it ended i remember being impressed with the quality of the animation at the time and was impressed once again when i watched this tape produced in the animation was state of the art and allowed the producers to create space scenes that would have been impossible with human actors in the first episode the survivor the enterprise encounters a damaged ship and beams aboard what appears to be a human he is a famous man who has used his fortune to come to the aid of people in distress lost five years earlier he passes all biometric identification tests although there are some anomalies in his medical tests furthermore his fianc from before his being lost in space is on board the enterprise the man is in fact a creature that is capable of assuming any form and of rendering humans unconscious for short periods of time it renders captain kirk unconscious assumes his form and orders the enterprise into the neutral zone with the romulans the creature also sabotages the ship rendering it vulnerable to attack the problem is discovered but before the enterprise can return to federation space it is surrounded by the romulans kirk realizes that the creature is a romulan spy and refuses to surrender the ship a battle ensues and he is able to extricate the enterprise in the second episode the lorelei signal the enterprise is sent to a region of space where a star ship has disappeared on a precise schedule for many years when the appropriate time arrives the ship receives a strangely compelling signal while it renders the men listless and easily manipulated although it has no affect on the women kirk spock and mccoy beam to the surface and are captured by the female inhabitants they are rapidly drained of their life energy aging very rapidly lieutenant uhura takes command of the enterprise and rescues the people on the surface and resolves the situation this makes this episode one of the best it is probably the first time that a black woman was ever placed in command in a television show the quality of the dialog of these episodes is outstanding a tribute to the writers and producers using the voices of the actors of the original series also enhances the realism they are some of the best cartoons ever made for television every fan of star trek will appreciate them 
challenging workout and fun i ve had this tape for years i came online to get it in a dvd format before i destroy the tape that i ve used off and on for the past years if you don t like to dance don t bother with this dvd however if you like to dance then that s what will make this one fun when i first started this vhs years ago and years younger i thought it was hard it took me a bit of practicing before i could get the steps but i didn t quit eventually i got all the moves i didn t even have all the range of motion either but that improves as your body gets use to doing the routines i haven t worked this vhs for a few years and i needed to get in better shape so i pulled it out again i am years old and about pounds overweight and if i can do this routine at my age it took me about two weeks to be able to get through it again anyone can do it the key is you must love dancing and this kind of aerobic workout you can tone the movements down until you get better at them and rev it up as you get better but once you get it you will always want to do it this is a great workout and i will be doing it for along time for all the nay sayers either they don t really like to dance or they just gave up too soon and by the way this was not called hiphop years ago hiphop is just a new name which includes a lot of old styles i don t particularly care for hiphop and i would not consider this a hiphop dvd 
don t watch with your parents great acting don t the let the simple title fool you 
i just want to tell everyone when this movie came out and i saw it at the movietheater you know the scene in the car where tine finally gets enough and hit him back everyone in the theater started yelling and screaming clapping their hands it was awesome and i will never forget it !

curleycue has it down i agree with you curleycue i couldn t wait to write a review to these people 
a great film this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film the shop on main street known as obchod na korze in what used to be czechoslovakia is one of several films released internationally during the popuarity of czechoslovakian movies in the us it remains one of the most famous ones also in the film a young man takes over a shop run by a jewish widow during the nazi occupation he helps take care of her and they become friends he then faces a dilemma when the nazis begin ddeporting the jews the film remain popular to this day and won an oscar for best foreign language film the criterion collection edition only has the theatrical trailer as a special feature 
informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
an inspirational view of a dark topic this book was a refreshing antidote to modern day bias during a time when ideology and mechanics take precedence over truth and objectivity it is refreshing to read about slavery s impact on various levels of society from clergy with political agendas to blacks who also profited few today would disagree that slavery is a terrible blot on american history but mrs stowe s book does a great job of portraying people as people black or white clergy or not humanity has inherent weaknesses and strengths that are not confined to any one culture or society 
lovely movie this sweet romantic movie is a favorite of many and perhaps woody allen s best film mia farrow is perfect as sweet cecilia who really deserves a handsome hero in her life jeff daniels is great in his duel road and danny aiello plays a villain with enough charm that you can see why cecilia got involved with him in the first place the s setting is well realized and nostalgic and the movie within a movie is fantastic since as others have said allen somehow makes the black and white fantasy world brighter and more appealing then the drab reality 
beethoven first as a man later as a legend daunting task it must have been to portray ludwig van beethoven probably humanity s most talented individual from any field of endeavor but gary oldman rose nicely to the challenge and in immortal beloved we have a tale that humanizes the supposedly marble featured maestro although whether that s for better or for worse is up to the viewer to decide concentrating on those incidents and years in beethoven s life that seldom receive much discussion this motion picture pursues the answer to the mystery of the identity of the woman dubbed by beethoven in a single surviving letter as his immortal beloved was it a countess with whom beethoven seemed to enjoy the most relative contentment in his stormy life was it one of the many admirers of his passionate music or was it some other woman perhaps one pre dating his fame long since lost to renown and history it s all only conjecture of course we ll never truly know but in making this film about a quest for enlightenment carried out by a longtime friend after beethoven s death we see not only an unusual biography of a great man but we are reminded that even one of the most legendary figures in all of history was once a young man who lived out many of the same experiences fears sadnesses and hopes that would be familiar to any of us we see beethoven transcend the brutality of his youth and the crushing blow of his increasing deafness to become the man who inspired the image of beethoven the stern visaged icon most think of him as being and yet even his brilliance was no defense against the pain of lost love throughout immortal beloved beethoven s wondrous music perhaps greatest ever written flies with free range if immortal beloved falls short of a masterpiece then it deserves at the very least recognition for its daring 
wonderful family program christy is one of my favorite tv series of all time it is second only to life goes on kellie martin shines as always this particular episode is especially touching to me because it centers around my favorite holiday thanksgiving in the sweetest gift christy and the people of cutter gap rise above their trying circumstances and learn to give thanks for the blessings they do have the most important one being each other christy s father becomes terribly ill but due to her faith and determination he gets well this series is definitely geared more to the female crowd but i think boys under would enjoy it too if you haven t read the book christy by catherine marshall please do it will definitely add to the enjoyment of the film all of mrs marshall s books are good i cannot believe this show didn t last longer on tv hollywood must have thought it was too wholesome 
still great after all these years bob woodward one of the real life heroes in the movie is still making news while reporting news at the washington post that s amazing i used to be a reporter and still am a democrat although a moderate now and i never was a fan of president nixon so i loved it when it came out i loved the book first and i was glued to the tv set and the papers when the whole watergate mess unfolded but ignore politics if you can when watching this there are crooks in both major parties and and dumb people promoted above their talents this is well written well directed and well acted and can be enjoyed just as entertainment here in the new century sadly the clinton years and the bush years too offer the realization that watergate type conspiracies designed to hold onto power avoid scandal or launder money are still with us 
great dance movie this is a nice movie not an oscar winner but very pleasant and no sex a virtue shortcoming depending on your point of view i purchased the movie for the salsa dancing but all of the dancing and music in the movie are great from the opening scenes staged in cuba to the last dance scene the the movie is big time fun it also is beautifully filmed chaynne and vanessa are both easy on the eyes so each gender will enjoy it the movie is defintely worth a viewing 
irresistable blend of attitude and style and content the premise of the story is funny a village full of women factory workers who live crammed together in dorms needs men so the factory owner charmingly pleads with the military to send an attachment of men to the town to give his girls something to do with their evenings but when the men show up they are all middle aged the young girls are disappointed what is even funnier is formans attitude and style which borrows some tricks in cutting and impromptu time shifts from the french new wave directors but adds to this famous style a lucid charm that is irresistable the cutting techniques innovated by the french new wave directors emphasized the looseness and spontaneity of life but formans sense of humor is such that he cannot help parodying the techniques he is emulating for instance in the dance hall sequence the camera slowly pans the feet of the band members which makes for an absurdly enjoyable incidental french new wave in technique but the humor is charmingly czech in tone the storyline makes some poignant observations about the new social mores of the sa married soldier trying to meet girls drops his wedding ring and proceeds to watch it roll across the dance floor where it falls to rest beneath a table of single girls the title character dreams of a young man to take her away from her grim life as factory worker living in a dorm full of girls but since the men she meets do not take her away she decides to take matters into her own hands and follows one to his hometown but arriving there she is greeted only with more grim reality she returns home to her factory job and dorm and finds solace in make believe as she tells her girlfriends a version of the events which conforms to her dreams very touching wise and satisfying film from a filmmaker who exhibits a fondness for all his characters no one escapes formans lighthearted satire nor his empathy which embraces all forms of life young and old remarkably light and poignant at the same time czech and polish films of this period strike an irresistable chord and are some of the most irresistable films ever made also recommended closely watched trains

billionaire oprah winfrey s favorite money guru nuff said i ve given many of these away because i have lived the life of an artist translated not made much money worked really hard and if i had only known these principles of how to allocate my money for the last of my years i d be just fine number of course it d have been smarter never to smoke saving at least over time in real dollars not to mention interest compounding or other unnecessary stupid purchases perhaps the most important and fascinating thing about the book is that you understand why you spend money or don t and it just naturally follows that it is easy to stop buying things to cheer you up keep you company whatever better to fix your life and not try to buy things instead because it ll never really be a satisfactory experience and this helps clarify what your values really are suze busts the notion excuse that i don t have the money and shows us all the truth that how we are spending the money we do have tells it all about what our values are are we saving do we buy clothes or cds or trips or too much food very interesting and surprisingly it is comforting to read this book no one should be able to graduate from high school or get their ged without passing a proficiency test on the principles taught in this book given the angst we all put ourselves through on love and money doesn t it make sense to educate ourselves and do these things better i also love the courage to be rich and the laws of money if you are currently poor buy these used through the z shops and soon you ll be able to afford amazon s discounted full price with super saver shipping on all future purchases thanks suze orman 
acting saves the day the movie doesn t really go anywhere but that s ok sort of a bittersweet examination of the difference between talent and morality just because you play a great flute doesn t mean you re a great guy woody allen himself plays the flute autobiographical anyone sean penn and samantha morton are spot on as the user and the used a pleasant respite from a lot allen s late s early millenium junk 
the beginning of documentary film one of the greatest films most of what i could say has already been said it is an important historical document of a vanished way of life it is a unique tribute to one man his stand agianst the elements flaherty invented documentary as we now know it in this film the filmmaker displays almost as much tenacity courage in recording the material as nanook does in his everyday life a measure of the film s greatness is the profound effect it had on orson welles after seeing the film welles is said to have abandoned the editing of his magnificent ambersons taken on a journey to south america to shoot in documentary style 
old message that still applies great movie with young actors that are still out there making movies this coming of age movie is clean and yet very real now as it was then the names and places have changed but the truth still applies highly recommended somewhat predictable but still very enjoyable there are enough characters that one of them must apply to someone in your group 
the choices we have to make will always haunt us a brilliant character study of an upper middle class jewish german family who escape to kenya in the days before world war having to adjust to a different world having to learn to confront her own racism irony of ironies having to face up to a marriage where she is unable to love as much as she is herself loved star juliane kohler manages to give a broad and poignant performace as does the rest of the cast highlighted by sidede onyulo as the african cook who becomes confessor and friend to the family let us be thankful that others got ahold of the source material before the likes of meryl streep found it a great film in my top 
ooh so hot but you re breakin my heart twelfth night may be one of shakespeare s lesser known plays but this production really hit it with my entire family even my two sons ages and loved it ! the trailer teaser for the movie played up the gender bender aspects of the plot but don t be misled there s nothing gay about this movie twelfth night is all about mistaken identity wistful and fruitless love and runaway egos all s well that ends well and all does ben kingsley as feste is my favorite character and his song at the movie s close really wraps things up well he helena bonham carter and nigel hawthorne are the best known members of what proved to be a very good cast so why not stars i am profoundly deaf the first time i saw this movie it was on vhs with poor toaverage closed captioning i so looked forward to seeing it on dvd the dvd version that i purchased is not closed captioned ! what s with that ! just copy the text from shakespeare s play and add it to the dvd ! i simply cannot believe that this is happening in the st century i now hate this product and feel quite slighted by the people responsible for making it available to the public 
a woman against the magistrate s authority it seems that many people think that a woman is totally sujectunder male dominant society under confucious order koreawas male dominant society and woman did not appropriate rightsand opportunity as man so what in th or th century european men did not allow or share their rights with europeanwomen either the reason why some feminists enjoy this film is that not onlythis story is love story which may make them feel guilty butalso it s a story of a woman who was not submissive to localauthority you can compare this movie with dagerous beauty inwhich a venezian courtesan could not challenge the authority for me the great scene is the magistrate s interrogation andtorture to chunhyang in this scene chunhyang did give up andsaid what she thought againt brutal magistrate s demand you are a daughter of a courtesan so you are a courtesan too you should serve to me it s a law if you will not follow thelaw i will punish you what kind of punishment is given to a man who tries to rapeand urge adultery to a married woman 
i m glad that they have finally put this movie on dvd only the lonely is a good romantic comedy type movie that has a great cast that includes john candy ally sheedy maureen o hara anthony quinn and milo o shea the movie is about a irish american cop who lives in boston with his over bearing overly opinionated mother and he falls in love with a woman who is mother doesn t like this is a cute movie and i m glad that they finally have put it on dvd 
fantastic character study you do not have to be catholic to appreciate the towering schievement that the nun s story is this is an example of what hollywood used to do very well in portaying an intimate character study against an epic backdrop audrey hepburn is simply tremendous as sister luke a woman torn between her devotion to god and service to humanity peter finch matches her as the world weary humanistic doctor as a catholic and educated by nuns this film gave me an appreciation for the sacrifices these woman make to better serve jesus christ and humanity it s surprising that a film of this magnitude took so long to make it to dvd 
solid acting and excellent story i really liked this film it s not a groundbreaking movie in any way though it s about a bunch of underdog kids who aren t interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented and unlikeable team it s pretty much the same thing we ve seen in the mighty ducks except now it s about football its just a typical family movie that sends the message to children that even if you re small and think you don t have any talent you actually do have the talent to play football hockey basketball whatever one of the characters is a girl who doesn t know if she wants to play football with the boys or be a cheerleader like all the other girls rick moranis once again plays that shy quiet character he does so well in other films such as honey i shrunk the kids it s hard to believe he s now a country singer no i m not kidding ed o neil doesn t quite play the jerk character you d expect from the married with children show he s not really a nice guy either though i find it interesting that the team names are the giants the good guys vs the cowboys the bad guys because the monday night football game this week were those two teams facing each other with the giants winning 
better of many older submarine thrillers i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine the actors well chosen the script very good and harrison ford s acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october or crimson tide whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew s attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian self sacrifice 
an antti keisala comment a nine film retrospective about love resnais with wkw s in the mood for love i anticipated this comment a little i am like any other and really enjoy most films when they find soulmates from others and watching them accordingly gives them richness that most likely was not intended by the film maker of course we tend to make up things that weren t intended by the film maker either but that takes the fun out of it these are also fun as retrospectives to watch during a holiday or weekend and they also expose to some fine film making this retrospective and a commentary series deals with women love and cinema and has nine films of which this is the first in chronological order of course i am like any other who wishes to write something that s endlessly complicated and hard to understand no worries there my friends i write fiction ironic film noir where even the writer doesn t know what s going on so first there is the preconception about french cinema and how it understands love women and sex everybody knows how it is and as such everybody knows how silly it really is it isn t how the spanish are creating a sexual narrative everything including the characters creates an empty vessel to be filled up not with introspection that could reflect into our own souls but with matter that comes from cultural dynamics when i think of french films in general i think of journalists and that isn t a good thing what this means is that not after this nor before ameli anything that the french made was cinematically beautiful not their women nor their love apart from rohmer because it doesn t mesh with their means this is a comment that s too polemic to be taken without slight irony i will most likely deny it in a timely fashion at least the sensual and truly hyper intelligent rohmer makes me wish i had steered away from ultimatums and i will but what is so amazing is that resnais is truly the kind of an intellectual you might connect to the french new wave and this film might put off many just because of its seemingly avant garde feel and let me tell you that to think this film as a new wave film is missing the point much like much of the new wave missed the point this film is about itself and making itself just as it is about making of itself but not in the conventional means indeed there is an actress and there is an architect two very introspective and cinematic figures yet just as marienbad goes deeper than any other french film in revealing the film s function in contrast to memory the catalyst in this film is love and it is war and fear that is used as a wrapper not the self referential material i find the focus on the subject of love and sex as the true center of creating an abstraction sensually fluid as if the film had a soul of its own this film has a soul and heart of its own think of a love letter become conscious of itself writing and reading itself these are groundbreaking ideas that the new wave wished to tie into a reality resnais wished to go the way of dreams and reflections and memory and even if we care nothing about that this really could be a profound experience but to be interested in the subject this is everything everywhere and it s love that is driving us into and out of the bomb the next step would be mikio naruse s film onna ga kaidan wo agaru toki that is when a woman ascends the stairs not as layered a film as this but it has fluid camera work very much anticipating wkw and yet it is something that differs from the most fluid marienbadwith best regards a 
a very sweet british film i loved this movie right from the start craig ferguson and brenda blethyn are wonderful together and some of the scenes of little old ladies geting unknowingly giggly on tea are just a hoot i d always liked craig ferguson as mr wick on the the drew carey show and it s nice to see that there is so much more to him than just that character 
small precise movements target the glute area the lotte berk method is a form of exercise developed by russian dancer lotte berk and brought to america by lydia bach drawing from dance and other similar disciplines many of the exercises require the use of a ballet barre and the focus is on making small precise movements to facilitate the development of long lean muscles as the title suggests high round assets particularly targets the muscles in the glute area with the goal of creating a higher and firmer behind like all of the lotte berk videos this workout begins with high knee lifts to warm up instructor kristen lilley leads two other lotte berk instructors one of whom shows modifications and one of whom uses a wall actually a column in this case instead of a barre also included in the warm up are push ups sets of on your knees and then sets of reverse push ups performed with your hands behind you and your chest up to switch the work to the triceps after the warm up the workout moves to the barre for several sets of leg lifts beginning with a straight leg you lift your leg behind you and make small slow lifts upward for sets of the next sets are performed more quickly after repeating on the other side you then do a bent leg version again starting with slow lifts and progressing to quicker lifts this focus on doing only a couple of different exercises with a very high number of repetitions is different from the other lotte berk videos but i found it to be more effective however like the other videos there is an emphasize on stretching so you always perform stretches between the movements after the barre work it s on to the floor for back dancing which is basically a series of pelvic tilts done while lying on your back these moves are performed a variety of ways including emphasizing one side only and placing your feet into different positions but you are constantly moving with no breaks inbetween the workout ends as all the lbm videos do with a shape by stretch section in which you perform hamstring and other stretches at minutes this is a short efficient workout for targeting your glutes mine were definitely sore the next day ! i found the instructor kristen to be more tolerable than some of the other lotte berk instructors but the style of these videos might not appeal to everyone especially since the exercises are quite repetitive however i would recommend this workout to anyone looking for an effective means of making the most of their assets 
mock on more than years old now and a little dated spinal tap is still loads of fun with the mockumentary gang including christopher guest and michael mckean who did the delightful best in show in every aspect of s and s rock music is lampooned surprisingly director interviewer rob reiner comes off a little flat but maybe that s just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters big bottom a sendup of fat bottomed girls one of my politically incorrect favorites the sophisticated sex farm and the controversial smell the glove ultimately released as tap s black album are among taps big hits 
a quotgreatest hits quot compilation for monty python this is monty python at their very best very little of the amusing but confusing sketch comedy that can be so hit or miss with american audiences this is a collection of their material that appeals to the general public this needs to be re released so that people can get a chance to see how delightful this comedy troupe was 
absolutely fascinating i watched this dvd set when i checked it out from the library where i work as a librarian i found it so fascinating that i bought the set knowing that i will watch it many times the set is so chock full of information that you can t possibly absorb it all at once david attenborough is an absolute master of this type of educational documentary i highly recommend watching this set even if you just borrow it from your local public library 
leaves this and goes to burning down da house this movie is very nice and right i mean enjoyable i just can t understand how steve martin lowered his standards in the past few years especially in when he made a movie that was the total opposite of housesitter what happened steve 
very depressing tale the title of this movie holds no secrets the virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic between the acting and a great story line but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions 
claudette colbert and writer director preston sturges it doesn t get better by screwball comedies had become quite old fashioned nevertheless when the palm beach story was released it became one of the top box office winners of the year and garnered much praise for it s stars and writer director preston sturges marriedbut penniless couple gerry and tom jeffers claudette colbert and joel mccrea decide to divorce so gerry hops the train to palm beach to make all the proper arrangements realising his big mistake tom follows gerry but when he arrives in palm beach he discovers that gerry has already moved on with eccentric zillionaire j d hackensacker iii rudy vallee things take another zany turn when tom is chased by j d s man eating sister princess centimillia mary astor hilarious slapstick sequences and the rapier dialogue of preston sturges makes this film one of the greatest of classic hollywood comedies claudette colbert s performance as gerry is easily one of her best evoking fond memories of her oscar winning role in it happened one night joel mccrea who spent most of his career idling in b movie territory is the perfect straight man to colbert s comedic whirlwind rudy vallee and mary astor steal every scene in which they appear with great support from sig arno as the princess latest conquest robert warwick william demarest chester conklin and frankin pangborn 
a cute story this movie has some ladies in it that i reallylike alexis bledel and america ferrara so i decided to give it a try the storylineis about a pair of magic jeans that areshared by the group and of all the thingsthat happen to them while they have thejeans in their possession of course it is rather unbelievable and is totally fiction but it does rendera smile or two it s definitely a chickflick but it is a good one for friendsand sisters to watch together ! popsome popcorn pop in this movie get your ya yas together andenjoy 
pesci s philosophy with honors is a thoughtful and well done little slice of life with a moral we ve all heard before do what makes you happy and take time to live your life director alex keshishian and screenwriter william mastrosimone however don t knock you over the head with its theme and or morals there are some scenes where you re expecting the probable to happen and they don t e g after simon cooks gorky the rooster you expect his master to be furious when simon finally meets up with the son he abandoned you expect some kind of tearful reunion and you certainly think monty is going to graduate with honors the end results of these scenes however avoid the usual cliche joe pesci is delightfully understated in his role and although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable you understand his pains and shortcomings brendan fraser starts out pretty snooty and insufferable but as he matures in his relationship with both pesci and moira kelly who is delightful as courtney fraser becomes a more sympathetic character patrick dempsey adds some lightweight humor as gorky s master and josh hamilton eschews the usual pain in the butt role with a believable and touching change of heart the movie is definitely manipulative but its heart is in the right place and its cast takes it seriously so it ends up being a charming little film with a strong reaffirmation of the human spirit 
a masterpiece i taped this off the air when it was first broadcast then bought the ld s when they came out seeing that a dvd release is not likely i treasure them a wonderful documentary 
a must see film for fans of the once great deathrow records this is a must see film that adds alot of insight to the back story of the late s early s rap scene very cool and enjoyable alot of surreal storiesmy only prob with it not enough focus on both easy e and pacbut still a must see flick 
cast as history s ultimate femme fatale liz taylor certainly appeared to be reinforcing life taylor stole the spotlight from cleopatra she was grander in her own person than she was on screen as someone else it isn t big or intelligent or daring enough but her interpretation of the empress is not without some charm and some fire mankiewicz shaped the characterization to suit her the movie follows her from the father daughter romance with caesar to the tempestuous man woman contretemps with marc antony the forty milliondollar epic is constructed as a series of views of the taylor woman complaining and making her way into caesar s bed to ruler of the world and to the human being who was too much for marc anthony taylor is much better in the first part as the cunning nubile daughter to caesar s wise father she s quite pleasing she can handle the sardonic cracks and the little girl petulance though of course rex harrison s courtly insouciance helps to shape her own performance shes expected to do much more acting as the womanly passion driven queen but she s more in control of the character when she s playing caesar s pupil rather than marc anthony s teacher her high comedy exchanges with harrison have quiet authority her doomed romance with burton never ignites 
i so loved this movie so much this movie is so comforting to me its sweet funny and def gives you a message no matter how green the grass may seem a man that has a lot on his plate kevin bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman it s not always moral of the story is you need to go with your heart he realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his single self i absolutely love this movie love the music love the actors love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby too funny ! 
a beautiful film that pulls at the heart strings i m an avid reader always have been but i ve felt kind of burned out of reading as of late and who wouldn t be after reading hundreds and hundreds of books one after another usually reading two books at a time several books a week also my schedule no longer allows me the freedom to read as much as i used to and that is why i decided to watch this film when netflix sent it to me despite the fact that i hadn t read the nicholas sparks novel first now i wish i d read the book this is one of the most beautiful tear jerking stories i have seen ! everyone who knows me knows that i m a sucker for stories that pull at the heart strings they also know that stories centered on star crossed lovers are my major weakness most of my all time favorite books and movies have those characteristics in common i won t go into details about the plot because i don t want to give away spoilers to potential viewers though i m sure many people have done that already all i can say is that you cannot go wrong with this film if you re a hopeless romantic the actors are wonderful ryan gosling and rachel mcadams transmit all of the right emotions and do a flawless job with the characterization they add a great deal of depth and range to their characters and i can t imagine better actors for the roles gena rowlands is also wonderful as the older allie and i like the s setting and the backdrop however brief of the second world war the wardrobe settings scenery and cinematography are flawless the dvd is a great investment the widescreen edition makes viewing all the more pleasurable i cannot recommend the notebook enough i don t know if i ll read the book because i don t like reading novels after i have watched their film adaptations but i will definitely read other nicholas sparks novels in the not sodistant future 
the s are back i thought it was a pretty funny movie it defintely brought me a flashback from the s i loved it then and i still love it now thats why i absolutely had to add it to my s collection ! 
good movie this is a good movie that starts out as an adventure and slowly changes into a morality movie i like it and think its setting is contemporary and timely 
a possible future this is a rather scary look at what could be a possible future if things continue the way they are heading our food supplies becoming more depleted due to unfavorable growing conditions climatic extremes lack of water and nutrient poor land as well as overpopulation continuing at an uncontrollable and alarming rate this type of recycling may become a necessity hopefully it would at least be voluntary as the movie depicts an eye opener for sure 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography 
one of the best comedies ever great cast help make this one of the funniest movies ever 
fabulous as always this is a great show along with the sound of her italian tour and all of drowned world minus the sexual perversion her sound is rich on all of her live dvds i pump them all out on my dvd stereo system but where is the blond ambition dvd somebody get it out there so my madonna dvd live collection will be complete do get girlie show if you like madonna a bit too much sex for me but the sound is good 
great movie but transfer is not the best i love this movie and could watch it many times it includes the best part of an earlier harold lloyd movie the football scene from the freshman there is also a wonderful scene where he hangs from a lion off the side of a building the only thing wrong with this dvd is that the transfer is not the best the video and sound quality could be better but is not horrible like the milky way dvd from the same company 
a very great film the live performers are excellent ! this film takes you back to a time you have lived in before or wished you had the groups and performers in this film are simply outstanding little richard is at his all time best he may have never looked any better than when he was in this film of course jane mansfield is perfect for the role she was quite the presence throughout and captures your heart with her warm down home character that only wants to settle down and have a home if your nostalgic though this is the film for you the soundtrack is a real star production highly recommend you view this and draw your own opinion it isnt really a dramatic masterpiece but it is like a hard days night was for it s capture of time for the fab four this film allows a similar feeling of nostalgia in that sense a place in history when the performers are on thank you 
best men is a wonderfully written production and very unique this movie was suggested to me and i cannot thank that person enough for doing this this movie had a wonderful plot unique characters and outstanding use of shakespeare i love unique interpretations of the his and his work i think that the writer showed wonderful creativity in his characters and use of shakesperean phrases cliches and monolouges it was a real fight the power movie and i enjoyed that 
great given as a xmas present my daughter was very happy thanks for the speedy delivery 
elisabeth filarski my soul survivor elisabeth filarski kicked ass oh who evers bought it has it got alot of elisabeth anyway i hope it works on australian dvds or else im gonna kick some ass 
think you used enough dynamite there butch first off let me state up front that i have been remiss in my reviewing duties it s just that i haven t really found anything over the past few months that excited me enough to write about it here for you the amazon readers who may rely on the guidance of a twenty six year old grocery store employee who would like to be the next nick hornby or p j o rourke i apologize for my tardiness secondly i love this movie i first saw it a few months ago as part of my film class s critique of traditional hollywood genres and how they have been tweaked over time needless to say butch cassidy and the sundance kid provided the perfect example of this what western would have the heros run away from the law much less take time to ride a bike accompanied by an insipid but inspired pop song butch cassidy is everything that is right about the big budget hollywood film star performers who don t mangle the material with their egos but rather play with the conventions of what they re supposed to do all under the watch of a talented if not well known director as the screenplay marries the real history of the notorious outlaws with the liberties of a real shoot emup western i loved this movie so much i ended up doing a scene analysis of the second hold up as my final project for the class and got an a of course so now we have the special edition version presented in widescreen and clear and crisp as the day it was first shown in american theaters in the fall of paul newman and robert redford carry the film through their obvious chemistry and brokeback mountain jokes aside they make the perfect bickering couple for this rollicking trip through a not sofamilar old west the film also features some top notch work from katharine ross elaine from the graduate as the woman they share no not onscreen at least strother martin as the one man willing to give the outlaws a straight job and gets shot by bandits for his trouble and the world s unluckiest employee of mr e h harriman whose superposse symbolizes the modern times that catch up with butch and sundance even in bolivia i haven t gotten into all the special features yet but i recommend the commentary by goldman who is rightfully proud of this film also the history behind the lens documentary is interesting and at ninety minutes a treat for history buffs who want to see not only how the film differed from the story but how often it got it right the theatrical trailers are interesting nuggets from a time when jerry bruckheimer hadn t ruined movies with achingly slow pans and close ups set in dramatic lighting with overbearing orchestral scores or tom cruise shirtless and all of what follows is true gives us more recent interviews with the principal cast still around newman redford and ross all in all butch cassidy and the sundance kid is an impossibly giddy mix of drama and comedy set against the backdrop of a dying breed the western outlaw and the last days of the frontier not in north america but south yes there are problems with the film but the overall effect of the piece leaves audiences satisfied that they took the journey and it doesn t hurt that redford and newman are enjoying the hell out of the work they re doing which shows through to the audience it may be a cliche but butch cassidy and the sundance kid still delivers if only all westerns could be this good 
groundbreaking ark of a classic it was the summer of i wasn t even born yet and a movie that would give harrison ford s career a much needed bolster with the first chapter in the ultimately successful indiana jones trilogy entitled simply raiders of the lost ark and this is still light years ahead of it s time especially when placed against countless generic action movies of recent times set in the dust bowl year of indiana jones is a world archaeologist who is on the quest of recovering an ancient artifact called the lost ark from a remote tribe in amazonian brazil but the ark is being persued by rival archaeologists who are trying to gain a hold of it and turn it over the german nazi forces who plan on using to completely take over the world and now with the help of a vixen bartender named marion ravenwood indie and marion must recover the ark and prevent the nazis from gaining power from the ark this movie is just utterly amazing and has aged so well even after years since it s release back in the special effects especially by standards are amazing and hardly look dated the acting is awesome especially by harrison ford as he shows the emotional vulnerability of indie and karen allen is head on perfect as marion ravenwood the third part the last crusade is my favorite of the three indiana jones movies but raiders of the lost ark is a very close second favorite tied with s temple of doom this is a must have movie but buy it with the indiana jones dvd collection ! it is amazing ! 
the hot chick this is one of rob schneider s best movies schneider plays as a middle aged hobo thatswitches bodies with a popular mean high school girl rachel mcadams has to find the guy that is inside of herbody so they can switch back before it is too late 
indiana in india the scene opens in shanghai where incredibly sexy wilhelmina willie scott kate kapshaw leads a stunning cabaret dance only to be stolen by indiana jones harrison ford together with a very precious diamond and an airplane from a very powerful chinese mafia boss all with the help of short round ke huy quan a streetwise little chinese boy with a very irritating voice surely based on chang from the tin tin books they land seemingly by chance in a poverty stricken indian village where all the children have been stolen away by a savage thugee cult of death from there it is on to the pankot palace before our friends descend into the pits of the hellish temple of doom where they must rescue the poor enslaved children plenty of suspense and action some quite gory scenes comedy and of course the romance between indy and willie who really looked sexy in that outfit she was wearing when they came out of the mines not quite the masterpiece that raiders of the lost ark was but most of the time it was entertaining although the scene in the cocoa pans in the pits did really drag on and what happened to that cute little maharaja in the end 
as true now as then back in my army days when dinosaurs ruled the earth it was a common belief among many if not most of us laboring for the cause in green fatigues that every shavetail nd lieutenant who ever put a pair of gold bars on his shoulders or an lt clip on his collar should be required to watch john ford s fort apache before he drew his first duty assignment and should be also required to write an essay on what it meant same thing we all consensed should apply to every officer being promoted to a higher rank right on up the scale the reason for this we felt was that everyone moving up needed to always be reminded that the book ie military regs tactics etc was only truly workable as a general guideand was not a foolproof blueprint for micro managing warfare or life on a day by day basis all too often obsessively going by the book and ignoring all contrary circumstances around you will land you in a heap o trouble and this by thebook or company s op mania is a nuisance factor that often bedevils people to this very day in all walks of life from hospital staffs to office staffs to restaurant workers to all manner of others where the book both intervenes and interferes with a practical real world effort at getting the job done all to often the book iscompiled by executive types who have nothing better to do than sit around and make up silly unrealistic and impractical rules and regulations most of them with regard to consequential spillover effects not very well thought out at all that other people have to try and make workable fort apache tells the story of a book soldier henry fonda s col owen thursday a by thenumbers martinet who has come to the arizona frontier with his head full of von clausewitz sun tsu alexander and bonaparte and west pointconcepts of pinchers and envelopments he is an arrogant elitist who views american indians as crude unsophisticated savages and who eyes their capabilities as fighting men withscorn and dismissive disregard john wayne plays captain kirby york fort apache s executive officer behind fonda and the leader of a cadre of veteran officers and ncos who know the territory and know their adversaries the apaches know them well enough in fact torespect them and to account for their strengths and capabilities in dealing with them all this knowledge and feel for the apaches means nothing to thursday when he comes swaggering in and he takes no time in letting everyone know everything will henceforth be done his way the garrison is troubled and uneasy about his way but they have no option but to follow his lead he is the colonel york tries to reason with thursday but gets nowhere he even gets used most egregiously and dishonorably by thursday in luring the legendary cochise over the border from mexico into u s territory there seems to be no ploy the arrogant colonel won t use in his quest for promotion and prestige within the army thursday gets his comeuppence in the end but unfortunately he makes a lot of other good men pay the ultimate price for his own incompetence and ineptitude along with him in many ways the thursday character is a bit of a take off on george custer although thursday s demise is based more on the fetterman massacre of rather than on little big horn fords direction is sure handed in this and the performances of john wayne and henry fonda are superb the black white cinematography is excellent and the jaunty use of th century cavalry music particularly the girl i left behind me is enough to get one s head nodding and toes tapping whenever the band stikes up fort apache may be overall the best of the famous cavalry trilogy with she wore a yellow ribbon coming in a very close second behind it rio grande is not a klunker either by a long shot but doesn t really have the sheer power of the first two and the only reason this trilogy is not a quartet is that the horse soldiers is a southern rather than a western and no indians are involved in it and note if you like this rip roaring cavalry stuff you also need to check out errol flynn s they died with their boots on and santa fe trail fort apache should have been dvd available much earlier than now but it is here at last so lets all enjoy this marvelous piece of americana 
a beautiful stone merideth is meeting the in lawsher boyfriend everitt is taking her home for christmas this ll be fun right not exactly well not for her merideth is uptight and classy different from her boytoys family and much to her dismay they hate her so much so that they will do anything to make her stay uncomfortable they accuse her of being racist they accuse her of hating gays everitts brother thad is gay and his lover is black they make her feel unwelcome and as if she were putting out the whole family especially younger sister amy played brilliantly by rachel mcadams in fact they make her feel so unwelcome that she ends up staying in a nearby hotel and calling her sister julie to come and stay with her take note that while a comedy this movie has quite a few emotional points and theres a dinner scene that left me quite uncomfortable the acting across the board is brilliant with keaton and mcadams taking the lime light and parker is just amazing in her role with equally impressive performances by wilson daines and nelson i recomend this movie because its a nice change of pace it tackles important issues those of love and trust and family and the importance of acceptance in our lives as tense as it can be there are plenty of laughs that take your mind off the tension and a heartwarming ending that will make you smile inside and out

scorsese over all i didn t think much of the woody allen segment although he s one of my favorite filmmakers and i hated the coppola piece but i m still giving this one stars because of quotlife lessons quot which in the first of three short films in this collection no other movie that i can think of better illustrates the creative thought processes of the artist nick nolte or their sense of lonely isolation he cannot live without women and even hilariously tells his young assistant and i quote from memory quoti don t know anything about love i was married and divorced four times before you were even born quot nolte is tortured by his desires and his isolation but even lust will not allow him to compromise his artistic integrity when arquette pleads with him concerning whether she has any talent or not nolte refuses to lie to appease her instead he elects not to answer her question which infuriates her even more although he is downtrodden throughout much of the film the ending is a happy one i own the vhs and have seen the minutes of quotlife lessons quot at least seven times over the years i highly recommend it 
brilliant i am eleven and me and my younger four year old sister both think that the lizzie mcguire movie is one of the best films we have seen towards the end of the film lizzie sings a song called hey now and my sister since she was two has been singing along it appeals to all ages even our mum likes it it is a truly unforgetable film not to be missed a true girly film about a teenage american girl called lizzie going on her first visit to rome with her school after being graduated from middle school on a trip to the ice cream shop an italian popstar mistakes her for his singing partner called izabella wont tell you the rest but but her last few days in rome were every young girls dream

i got everything by talking fast in a world that goes for talking and ended up with exactly nothing fallen angel is the second film that director otto preminger made with cinematographer joseph lashelle and actor dana andrews the first being his masterpiece laura this time dana andrews brings his deep voice and nuanced deadpan delivery to a film noir based on the novel by marty holland who is actually mary holland adapted by first time screenwriter harry kleiner and photographed with joseph lashelle s spectacularly fluid camera after an attention grabbing credit sequence speeds down a dark road at night eric stanton dana andrews gets off his bus before it reaches his destination he ran out of bus fare he finds himself in a small california coastal town where an errant waitress named stella linda darnell catches his eye she s a tough talking beauty coveted by every man she meets but only the one who will marry her and give her a comfortable life will get her eric wants that to be that man so he schemes to seduce money out of prim and proper june mills alice faye but when stella is murdered circumstantial evidence points to eric dana andrews was fantastically suited to film noir like humphrey bogart he barely moved his facial muscles when he spoke but was able to deliver a layered performance without emoting it s interesting to watch his face in fallen angel because so much of eric stanton is revealed in his forehead it s an exercise in acting with fine muscles only unlike humphrey bogart andrews had an imposing speaking voice he could deliver dialogue forcefully without raising his voice again perfect for film noir three films that andrews made with director otto preminger and cinematographer joseph lashelle are often classified as film noir one of them the brilliant laura is not film noir in my book it s mystery romance the other s where the sidewalk ends is often considered superior to fallen angel due to its psychological complexity but i prefer fallen angel for its fantastic crane shots its far more complex women and its aggressive introduction to its protagonist who gets off the bus and immediately starts conning the local conmen credit is due alice faye for bringing depth to a character that could easily have been saccharine and two dimensional fallen angel was to be her dramatic comeback after her great success in musical roles it didn t work out that way because she felt that producer darryl zanuck had butchered her part so walked out on her contract but i m impressed with faye s ability to convey subtle desperation underneath june mills sensible uptight exterior june is more terrified of ending up a spinster like her sister than she is of losing her money her reputation or marrying a swindler and when it looks like her sympathy and loyalty will not hold her flimsy marriage together she s distraught but her comportment changes only once she s a credible and sympathetic character not just eric stanton s saving grace fallen angel is a superb film noir with a knock out performance by dana andrews a star making appearance from linda darnell a dramatic turn from alice faye great supporting work all around and a seamless mobile camera from otto preminger and joseph lashelle the dvd th century fox there are photo galleries a publicity gallery posters and ads a production stills gallery photos and a unit photography gallery behind thescenes photos the theatrical trailer min is interesting in that it features a voice over narration by dana andrews a common technique in film noir but one that is not featured in fallen angel except in the trailer there is a good audio commentary by film noir historian eddie muller and susan andrews who is dana andrews daughter accordingly there is a lot of discussion oft dana andrews his career and many personal anecdotes which is a nice addition to the commentary eddie muller provides background on the actors and creative crew as usual and discusses preminger s distinctive camera work the long takes and mobile camera the transitions dialogue censorship and themes subtitles are available for the film in english and spanish 
hot show i loved this concert ! i always liked the routine she did for bye bye baby very clever she had a very tight band on this tour including omar hakim on drums who has played with sting and many other artists he keeps the beat like no one else this was such a playful show her later tours were a bit political in overtone but this tour was like a circus i much prefer madonna in this context no message just singing and dancing hot 
a christmas classic for every season there is a classic movie in our house a christmas story tops the list when christmas rolls around without a doubt this movie is a classic ! ralphie and his quest for the red ryder bb gun i do love this movie 
mystery murder the movie should be remaded in color the movie had a excellent review do to acting of ms stanwyck 
too many laughs i first saw this movie on tv in the mid s my wife and i laughed and snickered through the whole thing then i saw it again a few years later while in vietnam that was a real hoot with a bunch of guys watching and reacting some or more years later i remembered it and just had to have a copy for myself the entire movie about how to cheat on your wife and not get caught is chock full of cameos by readily recognizable stars acting out little scenarios as robert morse explains how to go about things to walter matthau it s a light no brainer full of amusing surprises for aspiring cheats who will have no clue what happens at the very end 
poem as film film as poem i think if charles bukowski dylan thomas and fellini collaborated on a piece of writing it s possible they would have come up with this screenplay this movie is exciting because it s soooo different from anything i ve ever seen deliciously non linear the substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that s the destiny of quotartist movies quot i loved hearing the dialog and kristofferson s acting is the best i ve ever seen by him anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people like other reviewers here but if you ask me that only validates the work if ever i go to new york city the hotel chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit my favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator who after claiming to have had a conversation with dylan thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the chelsea because people will listen to them there the dvd extras contain a couple of quirky interviews one with director ethan hawke and the other with robert sean leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film 
how far we ve come when i watched this classic documentary i couldn t help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here we just wouldn t make it what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls body piercing hummers and rap music underneath it all is a heritage that is raw rich and admirable and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now 
excellent film this film is really intriging for someone who doesn t consider herself a drama fan this film me in and kept me hooked the story of this writer really made me think about how art and drive and will to live can help someone overcome the most stacked of odds it is also a very interesting look into gay politics in that time and place in the world as a person studying glbt studies as a degree i recommend you view this film as a human being i recommend you view this film most people see it because of johnny depp s performance as characters but that fact is very minor although he does an excellent job the main actor is astounding and makes you believe what is real even though it is so unbelievable 
in orange vcd first off i m giving this stars because this concert is superb if purchased in the correct format but the point of my review is to comment on the video cd vcd version when i first heard of this i foolishly got excited about this because it boasted digital sound and picture well this is meaningless considering this format only allows gigs to work with in a double cd format whereas dvd s give at least gigs to work with the video is so compressed that it is not clear at all very grainy and the sound what a joke ! first it is terribly thinned out the bass and drums are almost non existent the percussion triggers are not there and the effects on robert s voice are also completely gone possibly worst of all the sound is sped up a bit and this just makes it sound extra terrible whoever produced this vcd must have been a complete nitwit i m convinced the cure didn t have any oversight of this horrendous product at all on the other hand the galore vcd is better the picture is still a bit lacking but the sound is at least correct the mix and speed is right it just sounds a little thin anyway my final point is don t let the word digital fool you a vhs tape beats any vcd hands down any day if you re still not satisfied with vhs there is a laserdisc of in orange but it is not without its own flaws although the picture quality is great the drums are a bit distorted when compared to the vhs and the audio video sync is quite off in parts in this case it really seems that vhs is the way to go 
excellent family movie great gift idea i love this movie it is a must see and a must have for any family movie collection love it so much ordered extra s for christmas gifts and all my family now loves it too teaches great lessons in life for children as well as adults riveting performances by all actors and it just really touches your heart when the movie ends you are left with a feeling of what love is all about and a gentle smile will be on your face 
worth a roll of the dice the varied reactions to this movie by other reviewers are interesting but nonetheless surprise me de gustibus and all that i suppose released in but set in this is a well written and well acted drama with much of the feel of s and s noir the look of the film presumably deliberately also has the style of an earlier era the sound track with ivory joe hunter lincoln chase big joe turner and others couldn t be more suitable the sleaze of course is much more advanced than would have been permissible thirty years earlier the hero j c cullen matt dillon is more complex than a pure country innocent corrupted by a wicked woman lorry dane diane lane a stripper at the gem club a small town gambler trying to make it big in chicago he has his own dark or at least not solight side which is why he takes up with lorry so readily yet he at least struggles with his conscience even if he doesn t always do the right thing tommy lee jones and bruce dern are in fine form as villains lee grant has just the right touch and diane lane has never been more stunning or more credible in a role the big town is not a big movie but it is a good one 
surprisingly moving and rich this fine film really snuck up on me emotionally but the superb performances of jennifer lopez sharon and jim caviezel catch are rich nuanced and ultimately captivating angel eyes works on so many levels suspense action drama and of course romance it intricately and sensitively deals with issues of life and death loss betrayal and redemption the ending doesn t tie up everything in a neat little cliched package either but aside from a wonderful script and crisp direction the key to this film is the chemistry of lopez and caviezel who can communicate so much from a look or a smile or tears particularly intriguing is the character that caviezel plays the enigmatic catch is he dead or alive an angel or devil is he psychotic or just deeply wounded somehow as the viewer sorts it all out caviezel plays mr catch as a warm yettragic figure who steals the viewer s hearts just as surely as he touches lopez s sharon speaking of lopez this is one of her best performances it s truly one from the heart she s gritty yet vulnerable tough but gorgeous i m not really a weepy type but all i can say is that sharon s amazing tribute to her father near the film s end had me getting embarrasingly misty eyed this is certainly a fantastic date movie it really would not be appropriate for children or younger teens however due to some salty language intense themes and brief scenes of sensuality i am amazed that caviezel didn t experience a superstar breakout as a leading man after this film but it is without question a brilliant and heart rending performance comparing his work here to what he has accomplished in other films including his landmark portrayal in the passion of the christ one sees his incredible versatility and range as an actor angel eyes is in some ways a collection of many small intimate vignettes that are woven together in a beautiful narrative tapestry while this film may not have burned up the box office in it s definitely a great way to spend an evening with someone you love 
the perils of disconnection suicide club is truly a japanese statement i enjoy japanese films for the interesting glimpse into a psyche strongly influenced by a world of forced detachment and often unfeeling behavior often asian films address the disconnected feeling associated with a fast paced demanding industrialized society suicide club normalizes the emtional pain of suicide into a what the heck fad asian horror often delves into the forbidden viewers eagerly though painfully peek as if watching a train wreck there is a statement i ve never seen an asian film that didn t have one that disconnection resulting from society s demands is paramount in this film the presentation can be compared to the unconventional shocks and cold emptiness of a clockwork orange not for children 
very good movie the first time i watched in good company i said to myself eh not good not bad just pretty average a couple reviews reflect that but ever since hbo started playing the movie constantly i find myself watching it more and more and enjoying it more and more the best quality about this film is that it s real you watch the story progress and you feel like you re watching reality i never found myself saying how unrealistic that could never happen the character s emotions seem real the situations seem real that all points to a well acted well written film also the movie doesn t try too hard it doesn t go out of its way to be funny doesn t go out of its way to give you a sappy predictable ending or stupid scenarios that so many movies end with just an interesting plot that flows and moves along with realism in mind instead of hollywood fantasy

a true disney classic i have seen this movie many many times and it still hasn t gotten old i would love to see this one on a two disc special edition 
fox has not taste once again fox has cancelled a brilliant show while it is occasionally a bit off color the dialogue is brilliant but apparently people couldn t follow the episodes so no one watched this great show and it was cancelled i haven t tried the download option but i highly recommend the show 
both gritty and delicate it s easy to dismiss the residents of the seedier addresses of our culture but the blue iguana makes us look behind the pasties not to just the flesh but to the real stories of these women whether caustic and hard crippled and soft or just plain exhausted blue iguana skillfully pulls us into places we might not otherwise go and shows us how much we don t see most notable are jennifer tilly who is in my opinion the st century s marilyn monroe and sandra oh oh delivers a breathtaking and heartbreaking performance as jasmine an intelligent and talented poet who dances because the money s better than waitressing while it s definitely easier to believe the somewhat stereotypical darryl hannah character angel the deadly gorgeous but warm hearted dingbat jasmine embodies the range of possibilities for each of the characters and for all of us without apology or fear this is a terrific portrait of woman s resiliency courage and spirit 
original angelina i am really glad that i got the unrated version of this movie it was worth the extra cost i would put this at the top of my favorite angelina jolie movies list hot dawg ! this one rocks mc white said check it out 
one of argento s best great kills inventive and stylish sets lighting and camera work what more can you ask for this is pure argentoright here i personally enjoy the ending and think that those who don t like it should watch it again and be a little more open to what dario crafted a must have for fans of argento giallo or thrillers in general star 
sad next tolast mcqueen film tom horn is a difficult film to watch at times knowing what we now know of the painful debilitating illness that star steve mcqueen suffered in his last years of life i recall at the time of the film s release it didn t get very good reviews but time has been kind to this film for starters it s obvious that mcqueen was in poor health when this film was made particularly in the sequences that are more physically demanding he appears gaunt and fatigued they film him in shadowy lighting and in many cases it appears that doubles are employed it s in the latter half of the film though that mcqueen s physical state adds dimension to his role the second half is devoted to horn s circus trial for the murder of a boy the way horn comported himself in the past made him a hero in the old west in the new west his methods are out ofstep and barbaric horn seems resigned in the face of this acrimony to accept that he is a man out of time though not quite of the same calibre this film brings to my mind john wayne s final film the shootist to appreciate this film i think one has to familiarize yourself with mcqueen s essential work that said this film stands as a fine elegy for a most outstanding career 
can i give this stars quotclambakequot is by far the greatest piece of cinema seen this side of memphis i love elvis ! while the costumes are a tad sketchy in this film this includes elvis suit that looks like a baseball and the transparent cover up on the silver bikini girl the songs music and lyrics are stellar scintillating if you will i wish i could find a cd soundtrack i have seen this film at least a dozen times in fact the first time i saw it i watched it days in a row showing it to all my friends who have since fallen in love with the cinematic genius that is quotclambakequotshelley fabares turns in an oscar worthy performance katharine hepburn stole the award that rightly belongs to ms fabares will this movie be loved by you i have quotconfidencequot that it will be 
not the best but hardly the worst little film the quality of the dvd is first rate the sound is good the picture quality is really pretty good with no distracting cuts tears lines or streaks i too saw this picture initially on tcm and it was good i do not fault how halting timid and one dimensional the character execution and plot development is in a place in the sun too much i am old enough to remember how strict censorship was in back when this picture was produced oh yeah by todays standards a place in the sun is a movie whose content is positively tepid compared to todays sexpot movies where if audiences are not treated to at least one bare no holds barred naked sex scene in a flick they feel profoundly ill used indeed an old movie has to be evaluated for its daring in the context of the time in which it was made for its time a place in the sun explored subject matter of class in our so called classless american society young mom s having babies out of wedlock and tangentally touching on abortion in early s perfect america each of these subjects were potential third rails not only hollywood but state and local censors could use to deny or restrict a films screen time or availability could the story have been told better yes could the staff and actors taken a few more risks or wrote the picture to bring the issues and passions into more clear believable focus again yes indeedy the writing if nothing else could have been written tighter to suggest things censors would have cut for sure if shown other well made pictures have used writing to convey indirectly subjects censors of the day would never allowed direct explorartion of all that said looked at with an eye to when it was made a place in the sun while not perfect picture is for its time a gutsy attempt to show a slice of american life that seldom got explored with the depth and sensitivity you experience in its viewing i will take one star off for a place in the sun writers who in my humble opinion did not go far enough to develop tightly defined characters using indirect methods that would have conveyed greater depth of personality and passion than could be shown directly in a s era film i give a place in the sun an a for an awesome effort i think a place in the sun deserves a place in any collection of great old movies because while not perfect its acting is powerful and its writing explores taboo subjects with a degree of sensitivity that make it worth watching 
in the mouth of awesomeness this film just rocks probably the best film in neill s carrear asside from event horizon master of horror john carpenter halloween the thing is back with his scariest movie to date ! sutter cane is the best selling horror novelist but his latest novel is driving his readers literally insane when he unexpectably vanishes his publisher sends a special investigator john trent sam neill to track him down on the search for the missing author he finds himself crossing a deadly barrier between fiction reality and insanity nothing is what it seems in this terrifying world of which there is no escape inspired by the tales of h p lovecraft this shocking story is in the words of it s acclaimed director horror beyond description ! i am a huge horror fanatic when i first saw this movie i rented on vhs i was blown away and i had to see it again the film draws you in and never lets go this movie is a definate must see for any horror fan 
one of the best i love this movie it has music drama love stories action and the circus behind the scenes 
star hotel basically a filmed play but so what it is a production so was driving miss daisy a play with just three actors the essence to the play is the end danny devito s soliloquy to the younger salesman about being self righteous this requires the build up of verbal events prior to this a good lesson for all of us essentailly a star hotel stars are for dances with wolves and the like

dvd please i currently own this vhs version but i would buy the dvd in a heartbeat if it were available and of course wide screen please with commentary if possible this movie and gigi are both among my favorites 
the duke and the rock finally together if you re a fan of either one of these late cinematic giants you won t be disappointed by viewing this flick both wayne and hudson were quite versatile actors but their roles in westerns appear to be their most memorable there s a fine supporting cast in this film which includes the two well known former national football league stars roman gabriel and merlin olsen making their acting debuts although the plot of this movie may not be historically accurate the average fan of western films will find this feature entertaining a western starring the duke would not be complete without an elaborate donnybrook the one in this picture doesn t disappoint overall this film is worth a look see 
what a shame firefly is imaginative exiting and heartfelt it is simply the best sci fi no scratch that the best tv i ve scene scince the x files the acting is very good the stoyline is compeling and by the last episode i felt like i was part of the crew i cant believe they pulled it before they even had a chance does that remind you of anything so here we are stuck with law and order svcipu and the so called reality garb when we could be watching something truly original what happened to tv that makes us think dont get me wrong but saving lives and putting away pervs is all good but its all the same ! where is capt kirk where is moulder where is river science fiction does nt mean out of this world firefly really hits home and holds a message for all of us right here in the st century watch the first episode and you ll be hooked i was 
favorite episode it was one of my favorite episodes a way to get buffy and angel together without changing the storyline and the characters where able to express how they felt to each other 
stars the dark sisters of the warewolf curse was great but should ve worked on the ending this movie was very interesting but why did the sister kill the indian guy and why did the bad guys just drop their guns and run and almost every horror characters always trip and the killer gets them but a good plot could ve been better but we don t even get to see how ginger killed the indian boy not scary but good to watch some parts were kinda gross like the dreams the sisters get and how the warewolves literally teared those guys apart 
stolen dignity in italy s classic movie the bicycle thief sociology and story come together as one for post world war ii italians convincing and with heart we experience the pain of antonio ricci lamberti maggiorani as he becomes one of the lucky few to get a decent paying job he is to put up posters throughout rome using a broom and adhesive if you ve been there like i have you notice that the city has bulletins and posters pastered all over their ancient walls to work he must have a bicycle he has one but it is broken determined he accepts but he hasn t the money for repairs his wife sells their linen to pay the bicycle repair shop all is set and his life has a whole new outlook until a thief steals his bicycle while he s on the job he chases him even hitching on a car to no avail he has a friend who takes him downtown and we see a whole market of bicycles some of which undoubtedly have been stolen the vast majority of the movie focuses on him and his young son bruno enzo staiola as he goes to every corner of rome to recover what misfortune fatefully handed to him in human form containing for then a non hollywood ending and sporting perceptive social commentary a bicycle thief comes off as a post depression grapes of wrath for urban italy it gets us there by easily providing empathy for the characters and telling a simple but solid story 
brilliant i loved this movie never played the game but the movie is great aside from the fact it doesn t rate like star wars etc it s good in it s own way i can watch it over and over and never get fed up with it too many people comparing it without seeing it for what it is just like the new battlstar galactica and the old one old one was good in it s day but new one is better in all classes ! anyway i think it s great 
early kurosawa foretells his cinematic talent this early akira kurosawa film is outstanding what captivated me about this early kurosawa film was the way in which he allows us to see post war japan it is truly remarkable that we are seeing the streets that just a few years before were being laid to waste by massive bombings the character played by toshiro mifune is also a great glimpse into what will become one of the greatest actors ever to come out of japan and there is the presence of my favorite japanese actor takashi shimura and with shimura guiding the young mifune through the maze of police work and suggestions on how to proceed with his obsession in finding his missing stolen handgun we see a wonderful study in character development in this early kurosawa classic criterion did a wonderful transfer with this film this is a truly great classic just looking at post war japan itself is a cinematic masterpiece highly recommended 
clever one of a kind reincarnation thriller reincarnation amnesia and a fascination with scissors combine to make this a little known classic superb acting from british comedian emma thompson and shakespearean actor director kenneth brannagh the ending will surprise you

great pirate movie this one came firstbefore the adventures shown on the big screen today you will like this one just as much if you don t mind the dating of the movie 
when films knew how to be cool this film is a cat s cradle of relationships in which some strings touch and others don t jeanne moreau s florence is never seen with her lover julien played by maurice ronet except in photographs at the very end a german couple on holiday crosses paths with two reckless teenage lovers and end up dead although this film directed by a yearold louis malle is generally considered a precursor to the french new wave it has all the elements in particular a mysterious emotionally tortured femme fatale played with quiet elegance by jeanne moreau her penetrating eyes are haunting as she walks through the rain searching for her lover she has one of those faces you either adore or are annoyed by i go back and forth myself but my own opinion of this film is that malle was showing off his tremendous talent just a bit too much and it comes across sometimes that he s trying too hard to be cool but most of the time his film really is cool and it s nice to be reminded how cool a film can be 
my man dr smith is a riot in this episode dr smith and the robot go hog wild switching personalities and swapping insults this is a great episode 
there you go with that wishin stuff again i wish you was a wishing well so that i could tie a bucket to ya and sink ya everyone has to start somewhere and while the public enemy directed by william wild bill wellman wings the call of the wild island in the sky wasn t james cagney s yankee doodle dandy white heat mister roberts first film it was one of his earliest starring roles originally cagney was set to play a supporting character but after stealing the show in the millionaire studio executives decided to set him as the star only a couple of weeks prior to shooting the public enemy and the rest is history as they say also appear with cagney is the original platinum blonde jean harlow hells angels edward woods tarzan the fearless joan blondell the blue veil donald cook whirlpool leslie fenton streets of laredo beryl mercer devils lottery robert emmett o connor a night at the opera mae clarke frankenstein murray kinnell anne of green gables the man credited for getting bette davis her big break into films as the film set in chicago begins it s the year and we meet two young delinquents named tom powers and matt doyle later played as adults by cagney and woods respectively anyway seems the junior hoods belong to a club run by a mug by the name of putty nose kinnell a fagin type who acts as a fence for whatever the street urchins in his club can lift as the years go by putty nose eventually hooks tom and matt up with their first big heist but things go down badly causing putty nose to leave everyone s cheese out in the wind in saving his own miserable hide as time passes tom s older brother mike cook who s a real goody goody goes off to fight the kaiser tom and matt fall into the lucrative bootlegging business once prohibition kicks in finding sponsorship through a relatively small time mug named paddy ryan oconnor who hooks them up with local dapper criminal type named nails nathan fenton eventually tom returns from the war a bit shell shocked learns of his brother s activities and the pair have a falling out causing tom who s swimming in coin now to move out of the family home and shack up with some dame clarke who he soon drops by way of a grapefruit to the face for another slightly more polished dame named gwen allen harlow after settling a score with an old acquaintance tom and matt soon find themselves in the middle of a gang war are forced to go into hiding but are quickly ratted out which leads to tom taking matters into his own psychotic hands which he does and then some as far as gangster films go the public enemy is right up there in my personal top five due primarily to cagney s indomitable presence and wellman s wonderful direction nearly every aspect of this film works together to create an engaging moralistic prohibition era tale set in the bad old days of chicago i learned a lot from this film including the following the short armed jab was a popular way to show affection back in the day gangsters don t like it when you lam out on them gangsters aren t very sympathetic especially when they catch up to someone who s lammed out on them a beer keg makes an interesting centerpiece on a dinner table black cats are truly bad luck mike s got one hell of a right hook at least before he joined the army mike doesn t care for bootleg beer if you re looking to break up with your significant other try shoving a juicy grapefruit in his her face as it really gets the point across if you re ever thrown from a horse best to protect your melon criminal types had really cool nicknames back in the day like nails dutch limpy and putty nose okay maybe those last two aren t so cool monogamy isn t a particularly cherished value among gangsters or their dames platinum blondes are hard to figure parents do have favorites gangsters have a sick sense of humor case in point tom s homecoming at the end of the film in terms of really lousy gooberment legislation resulting in disastrous negative after effects prohibition has to be in the top five as i said nearly every aspect of this film worked for me including the strong performances cagney owns the film with his portrayal of the ruthless cold blooded unflinching extremely lethal racketeer tom powers the well thought out engaging direction by wellman and the snappy dialog including lots of colorful gangster speakthe one element the felt a little off for me was harlow s character i think she was supposed to be a classy sophisticated type cagney s character hooks up with once he begins moving up in the world but she came off more as a street dame pretending to be a classy sophisticated type this was a minor point for me only noticeable because everything else worked so well my favorite scene from the film is near the end when cagney s character seeks revenge against a rival gang and stakes out their hangout in the middle of the night during a pouring rainstorm as the men arrive and enter the storefront cagney produces one of the most psychotic grins i ve ever seen his character enjoying the supreme satisfaction of knowing he s about to permanently settle the hash of those who ve wronged him another aspect that works so well with this film is the fact that most all of the violence is off screen providing clear and defined setups allowing viewers to utilize their imaginations in filling in the gaps which is sometimes much more effective than displayed bloodshed all in all if you re a fan of early gangster films or just great films in general especially ones with a doozy of an ending this one deserves your attention ya lousy mug the picture quality presented in fullscreen aspect ratio looks quite good especially considering the film is over seventy five years old the tones aren t as sharp as i would have liked but overall the picture comes across well as does the dolby digital mono audio extras feature a bit called leonard maltin s night at the movies which includes an introduction by lenny himself a newsreel of the day a comedy short titled the eyes have it featuring edgar bergen and charlie mccarthy a merrie melodies cartoon short titled smile darn ya smile and trailers one for this film along with another for one for a cagney film titled blonde crazy also included is a featurette titled beer and blood enemies of the public a commentary track with film historian robert sklar the re release forward and subtitles in english spanish and french cookiemanby the way if you re interested in picking up this film on dvd you might want to check out the warner gangsters dvd collection which features the public enemy white heat angels with dirty faces little caesar the petrified forest and the roaring twenties as it s probably a better value that buying the films individually 
blackmail death and sex invade a family this fine film has many stories one might be the story of individualism versus society where the former is represented by two blackmailing men out to make a dollar and the latter represented by a woman and her three children and absent navy husband maintaining a family but the strongest and most interesting one to me centres on the journey the handsome character played by goran visjnic makes from criminal to something of a rdeeming figure when he cannot effectively carry through the task assigned to him by his partner in the blackmailing strategy they have devised with an excellent music score strong design characteristics fine acting by all concerned this is a very fine film indeed worthy reviewing from time to time 
what fun with my own reservations i have to admit that a few things about this film disappointed me the acting was better than expected and the script was somewhat literate other than that this was all the schlock bad f x i expect from films of this genre amp time period it s interesting to know that this film was released by allied artists which was a studio neck toneck with american international for the drive in crowd a i went somewhat legit when they went with the corman poevincent price movies later the beach party films allied artists went a different route they picked up the options for the american release of quotepicsquot like el cid and days at peking my vote goes to a i for sheer originality enough history this is a fun film the special effects are absolutely laughable my favorite being the alien saucer leaving the polar ice cap obviously a toy being pulled up through soft wax a previous reviewer referred to this as quotwarmly corny quot i couldn t put it better bad sets bad effects and of course after brett halsey proves himself to be a hero and not a wimp his shirt is suddenly open showing lots of manly chest hair what a guy ! i ve always liked arthur franz especially in quotmonster on the campus quot all in all it s loads of fun for the quotbad sci fiquot afficianado my major disappointment with the dvd though it has great picture amp sound quality is that it should ve been in widescreen at the beginning they show news headlines declaring horrible stuff but you could only see the middle of the headline there was no perifery as far as sets go the perifery wouldn t have mattered but no one can deny that the majestic scenes of the arctic few as they were would have been awesome watch this and keep all of your other guilty pleasures beverages junk food etc handy if you can ignore the good points of the film the bad points will overwhelm you and entertain 
jason the argonauts very good fantasy movie excellent special effects vernon kestle 
very good and filled with lots of facts this is a good movie with a lot of facts it is up to date with the early s crashes 
great for all dog lovers i was so pleasantly surprised by this movie i ll admit though that i had low expectations because most kids movies are ridiculous i hadn t expected to sit and watch it with my child but i found myself pulled in through this whole movie from the beginning all the way through till the very last great line of the movie it may seem like a copy of other movies in certain ways but it is so well done funny sweet and poignant and the little boy who stars in it does a wonderful job a great feel good movie for dog lovers especially ! 
excellent realistic intense slice of an addicts life and how he gets clean despite himself michael keaton is perfect in this role no one else could have played that part he is selfish demanding self centered and hard headed and most of all full of fear slowly he begins to change even though is chaos all around him not only is this a good movie for addicts alkies jail inmates etc people who are trying to control an addict alkie would also benefit from this there is no way to control someone elses addiction it is very entertaining there are some hysterically funny scenes and for once aa is not made fun of i couldn t find it to rent it and so i bought and watched if times all ready 
it s my favorite movie this movie is my all time favorite movie the cast is awesome you really feel the pain and anguish in amalia played by lee grant as she struggles to deal with the last day of her son s life this movie reminds you that its important to never leave issues with others unresolved i love the way that randal kleiser was able to throw humor into a not so humorous situation and not come across as heartless the movie at times feels a little forced but i can t think of how you can tackle this topic in under two hours 
one of the finest films ever produced i saw career girls when it was released several years ago and i am buying the video because the film has been re playing in my brain ever since career girls like secrets and lies is slice oflife filmmaking at its very best there is not one wasted frame in the film and for every moment that is grim there are two that amuse stimulate and uplift this film should be on the top ten list of every intelligent film buff or for that matter of any one who enjoys timeless works of art 
very good british crime drama essex boys is a very good british gangster flick the main character jason locke sean bean has just been released from prison after a very long stay he finds that he is on the outside looking in with the drug ecstasy making some of his former friends and acquaintances a fortune he decides that he wants in on the action and not just a little action but a partnership however he is asking for more than he bargained for enter john dyke tom wilkinson who has already had his feel of prison and although he is running drugs on a low key basis jason locke demands that he be made a partner with full entitlement to funds from the lucrative drug market the problem is that jason locke is too wild in his ways whereas john dyke wants to be low key moreover john has already stated that he doesn t ever want to see the inside of a prison again and will do anything to see this never happens again and for him jason locke is a threat another character in the film billy creedmiles is the only sympathetic character in the film he is not a killer or bad person he just hangs out with the wrong crowd he has been hired by jason to be his driver at the same time he is an acquaintance of john dyke events occur no spoilers in which billy finds he is not safe anywhere the film is great and sean bean gives an outstanding performance as a hot headed ex con who finds he has pushed john dyke a little too far highly recommended stars 
interpreter i just purchased this dvd and watched it last night i also watched murder on a sunday afternoon a couple pf weeks ago they are both pretty much the same film dont get me wrong this is a really good movie with one exception it really needs subtitles i could barely decipher what the ward bros were saying through most of the film i kept having to rewind and turn the volume up to understand more than half of the dialouge of the entire film the ward bros were constantly mumbling with a big wad of chew in their mouths i really should have rented this first but i bought it for the filmmakers reputations i own all of their other films and watch them alot i would recommend renting this first and if you have a closed caption on your tv i would highly recommend using it 
lots of fun this movie is great vanessa williams is not only beautiful but you would think she has been competing in professional latin dancing for real she is very talented chyayanne also heats up the dance floor and is very charming not to mention easy on the eyes the dance scenes are hot it is loaded with not only great dances but great latin music and likable characters it is fun from beginning to end and will leave you wanting to hit the dance floor 
one of the great performances in the best film about monastic life ever made audrey without givenchy and only a portion of her face visible few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances the depth of the movie the richness amount to a great piece of art certainly the movie is not fun but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster 
a very human story of love and parenthood ok i ll start off by saying that i m straight and have loved this movie since the s it s wonderful ! fierstein is so great and ann bancroft is the quintisential jewish mother and in my opinion basically steals the movie harvey gives a great commentary on this new edition but if you haven t seen it yet watch the movie without the commentary first and then watch it again you ll laugh you ll cry you ll sing along 
old movies i have wanted this movie for a long time it is one of my favorates also found the price not to bad 
mother s day all time favorite horror i first saw this movie when i was about or years old back in or at my mom and dad s friends house i still remember watching it when i was a kid it scared me to death i found the mother in that movie to be very creepy the scenes that bring back memories are queenie at the end of the movie the sleeping bag seen the hippies in the car with mother i am a huge s s and semi s horror buff but this movie here is my all time favorite horror i lent this movie to or of my friends and they are horror buffs they have never heard of this movie before and they watched it and they loved it i have to give hats off to charles kaufman for making the best horror movie of all time 
sad chapter in american history based on actual events rosewood relates the events that led to as many as african americans being murdered and burned out of their homes in rosewood florida in by whites from a neighboring town all this happens because a white woman falsely accused a black man of raping her truly a horrific tale all the more so because it happened although an accurate death count has never been determined this sad account went unknown for many years due to a cover up as well as resident s refusal to talk abou the events director john singleton probably takes a worst case scenario view of the body count and pure horror with burning bodies being hung by the neck and other such gruesome crimes caught up in this chaotic story is ving rhames playing mann a former soldier who was merely passing through town and ends up having to fight for his life as well as heroically saving a number of children from the marauding racists don cheadle gives an outstanding performance as a rosewood resident who proves smarter than the rednecks jon voight plays a local business owner who is sympathetic to the blacks and for that is labeld a lover by the other whites but voight doesn t care and actually provides a safe harbor to several blacks after the attack begins michael rooker who also played in mississippi burning gives a fine performance as sheriff walker who while racist himself finally realizes that the accusations were false but by then is unable to stop the mayhem bruce mcgill is the typical fat white redneck as duke purdy the film is beautifully shot and john jenson deserves a big tip of the hat for his cinematography as he captured the small town ramshackle look of s florida that greatly lent to the film s look of authenticity very powerful film so sad yet an important film for people to watch especially our young people as incidents like this should never be forgotten 
awesome i can watch this movie over and over but who couldn t with christian bale in it the gun battles and fight scenes are great it is a must have

long waited dvd well this is one of the long waited dvds from pink floyd the video and sound are great the extras are not so special but for the pf fan this is a must still waiting for the delicate sound of thunder dvd 
wow just wow there s not enough good i can say about this film it is fascinating on so many levels filmmaker andrew jarecki s original idea to film new york city birthday clowns took a new tack when he met clown david friedman who had a family secret infinitely more intriguing than his birthday work it turns out that david s father was an infamous long island pedophile whose story had rocked the small town of great neck in the late s the film is a chronicle of the friedman s story from the days before the scandal until the present father arnold friedman is a beloved high school teacher who teaches piano and computer skills at his home after police catch him with a few kiddie porn magazines they start interviewing friedman s students suddenly friedman and his teenage son jesse are being charged with hundreds of incidents of sodomy and assault and their lives are turned upside down luckily from the point of view of the filmmakers the family had always loved taking films of themselves and did not stop during the family crisis much of the family s film and video footage appears in the movie either reinforcing or acting as counterpoint to the interviews they accompany but capturing the friedmans is about much more than a pedophilia scandal it is also about the way that the structure of the justice system police lawyers judges and legal procedures can sometimes generate convictions from nothing the film is also about memory specifically the way our memories are reshaped by the passing years research is now demonstrating that memories rather than being videotapes of the past are strongly colored by the way we see ourselves in the present in the film the juxtaposition of present day recollections with the written and filmed record is staggering the filmmakers are not trying to exonerate the friedmans or to indict those who brought them to justice the facts are laid out with all their gaps and contradictions the characters are allowed to tell their own stories with all their factual and self serving facets and we are asked to respond are the friedmans victims merely odd or truly evil how did a community come to believe what seems to be a bizarre story how did the legal system reach a verdict without adequate investigation by skeptical police or a trial before the peers of the accused was justice served or merely the justice system the disk dvd includes jarecki s interview on the charlie rose show as well as interesting material taken during q a sessions at the film s premiers the film s participants react to the way they are depicted usually continuing to make the case for decisions made years in the past sometimes escalating into confrontations and raw anger in short capturing the friedmans is a movie that i cannot stop talking about and recommending to everyone i meet 
classically chilling this isn t breakfast at tiffany s neither is it nightmare on elm st but wait until dark starring audrey hepburn is truly chilling hepburn plays a blind lady who through the circumstances of the plot is pitted against a dangerous criminal and his two henchmen she slowly realizes she is in danger and after smashing the lights in to level the playing field must struggle for her life in her apartment more along the lines of a thriller like pyscho than a horror film wait until dark is scary but classy 
essential quintessential profound and disturbing the greatest movie that many americans have never heard of naked won best director and actor at cannes in the action revolves around johnny played by david thewlis who rampages across the london night in a series of encounters in which he uses abuses and hurls vitriolic scorn laced with brilliant humor everyone johnny meets is twisted in some way and the effect is only heightened by the couple of seemingly sane people the film offers amongst them johnny s original love interest played by lesley sharp in one scene johnny is admitted into an empty office building watched over by a security guard and rages aloud his dark world view that includes both time and space and the illusion of the present but you re not in it now you re not in it now because the future is constantly kicking the present in the behind he is as merciless to a tourettic stutterer as he is ultimately to himself and johnny pushes to the very brink of madness in a film that uniquely captures the razor thin divide between genius and savagery from a brutal landlord s wonderfully mangled french to another superb performance by katrin cartlidge naked stands testament to the sheer raw power and insight that occasionally graces our screens 
if you loved the movie you will love this i really enjoyed most of the cd i would have liked some other songs to replace of the remixes of the quotdancehall queen quot track i jammed to quotlittle and cute quot quotjoy ride quot and quotmy jamaican guy quot and the track quotunbelievablequot reminded me of my husband ! all in all this was a great cd and i would buy it for a friend 
a grand slam tom berenger corbin bernsen charlie sheen and wesley snipes star in this fun film about the woeful cleveland indians baseball team and how a group of misfits and castoffs came together to make the indians pennant winners again berenger stars as jake taylor a former all star catcher who has been toiling in the mexican league he gets a call from the indians gm to come to spring training to be the team captain and help mentor the younger players these players include willie mays hayes wesley snipes a speedy outfielder who can only hit pop flys rick vaughn charlie sheen a flame throwing pitcher fresh out of the california penal league who possesses a blazing fastball but has no control and pedro cerrano dennis haysbert a hard hitting cuban who defected for religious freedom he can crush fastballs but nothing else he also has a shrine in his locker with an idol named jobu roger dorn corbin bernsen is a high priced third baseman who cares more about his investment portfolio than he does about baseball rachel phelps margaret whitten has inherited the indians after the death of her owner husband a former showgirl she is determined to move the team to miami where she will cash in on several perks from the city but to do this the team s attendance must fall below a certain level determined to get what she wants she begins taking things away from the team such as whirlpools and even their private plane soon the team is travelling to games by bus however the team has lou brown james gammon as their manager he is determined to make the indians winners regardless of what rachel does the season starts off slowly for the team and they are in their traditional last place position but the gm lets lou in on rachel s scheme and things begin to change the players realize that the only option they have other than becoming free agents or being released is to win it all and that s what they set out to do im a big baseball movie fan and this movie is one of my all time favorites the story is excellent being a cubs fan i m glad the producers didn t pick them as their team to use and the acting is tremendous the choice of bob uecker as indians announcer harry doyle was a stroke of genius his announcing and one liners really add a great dimension to the film rene russo does a good job as jake s on again off again girlfriend lynn wells its fun to watch their ups and downs throughout the movie there s even a take off on the then popular do you know us american express card commercials i give this teriffic movie my highest recommendation watch and see how a bunch of no names and has beens bond together for one magical season to become winners 
an uncomplicated straight ahead b w action film a classic old fashioned adventure flick featuring ronald coleman as a dashing young englishman on vacation in a nameless central european backwater when an attempted coup unfolds his striking likeness to that country s reluctant wastrel king leads to his conscription as a stand in monarch a task which he meets with typical british pluck coleman s dual acting role is a negligible achievement but he s fine as the hero douglas fairbanks jr gets in some choice scenery chewing as the oily baddie who backs the evil duke michael in his attempt to steal the crown some great artily arranged camera shots and moody shadowy sets and plenty of flashy spangly costumes now is it just me or does mary astor who plays a bad galgonegood bear a striking resemblance here to s actress julianna moore recommended 
westerns classic duke one of the best great cast opening scene remindes me of his early movie red river 
laugh out loud funny i ve seen stephen lynch live in this comedy central special and heard his audio cds live is by far the best experience but this video is a close second the live audience really enhances the experience this is some truly funny stuff 
one of truffaut s best near the beginning of this film a character says real estate is the place to make money not the movie business but he continues to work in the movies because he loves it that is what francois truffaut s day for night is all about people who love movies making movies i saw this film years ago but it was the english dubbed version i found the dubbing distracting and it had an effcet on my overall feeling of the film when the movie became released on dvd it included the sub titled version i am reviewing this version by seeing the film with sub titles i now think it is one of truffaut s best films only behind blows maybe you re thinking i m crazy can seeing a movie sub titled really make that much of a difference you have no idea just think about it now we can hear the original actors we can hear the emotion they put in their lines it is much different that hearing someone else plainly saying their lines it is almost like seeing the film for the first time as we watch day for night we see what it takes to make a movie all the problems that can occur amd unfortunately for truffaut everything that can go wrong does people die actors get pregnant crew memembers fall in love actors forget their lines and film footage is destroyed but as the saying goes the show must go on and why does everyone keep going on because they love movies it s one of the many reasons so many people have called this one of the greatest films about films in a class with contempt and to a lesser extent one of my favorites stardust memories day for night won the academy award for best foreign film in and two years later was nominated for best picture film critic gene siskel even hailed it as the best film of bottomline one of francois truffaut s best films and it may as well be one of the greatest films about the movies 
i love this movie i am not much of a hockey fan but after watching this i have had a lot more respect for the sport ! this movie is not all about sports it also has a twist of romance everyone sports fans and not should watch this movie 
crazy cool the actress jeanne moreau now almost pauses from talking about her film career as if something urgent has occurred to her she looks dead at you the viewer her eyes dark and instantly hypnotic you think you know a lot she says and you don t moreau then casually returns you to the story of how she made the groundbreaking elevator to the gallows with young louis malle her director and lover it was the decisive moment for the rest of my life the storied french actress says moreaus talk is one of several compelling extra features on criterion s release of gallows ascenseur pour l echafaud the movie itself somewhere between noir and new wave is remembered mostly for its innovations in camerawork and for its soundtrack a work of improvisation by miles davis that pushed jazz in new directions the french director made quite a few better films but gallows his first certainly will be of interest to jazz fans and the new wave hardcore the gallows set devotes three short films to the all night session that produced the davis soundtrack malle had nerves of steel to put something as important as the score in the hands of an improvising musician the critic gary giddons says in the minute interview piece miles goes modal davis recorded in paris with the expatriate drummer kenny clarke and three europeans each worked in front of a screen displaying a rough cut of the movie davis seems to duet with moreau s character who walks wraithlike through the streets of paris as he plays it was a flow says the actress a witness to the session also on hand was a french tv crew which came away with severely hip footage of davis improvising it runs about minutes the one channel audio taken from the mm print s optical track benefits from significant restoration davis horn sounds silky yet distinct in action scenes the cymbals and bass pounce out of the speakers henri decae s black andwhite images are works of art casting nighttime paris and moreau in natural light the free moving camera and low lighting were innovations that inspired france s emerging new wave gallows is presented widescreen with the enhancement extras also include a fun chat with malle and moreau at s cannes festival an interview with the somewhat disgruntled pianist who played on the soundtrack and malle s absurdist student film crazeologie which bops along to the titular charlie parker song 
thinking man s or woman s erotica and a solid noir a sharp starring role debut by susie porter and an unusual cinematic return by witness kelly mcgillis in this certainly the first ever lesbian film noir to be based on a detective story originally told in long form poetry porter s sleuth is as hard bitten as bogart ever was and director lang gives us plenty of luxuriously moody scenes of her aussie pi scrouging the enigmatic streets seeking clues to the murder of a troubled co ed how does femme fatale mcgillis playing an alluring bi sexual professor fit in who cares like porter s beloved car this offbeat whodunit offers a fine ride

to be forced to look at something this repulsive and still wanting to go along there are few pictures which can makes us experience the feelings and emotions of a mentally disturbed character in such a way that for a moment we seem to be that disturbed character in shock corridor a journalist goes under cover as a mental patient into a psychiatric ward but slowly descends into real madness the film tried but only succeeded partly we hear the journalists desperate thoughts in voice over and it sounds more like a radio play now then the real thing lodge kerrigan s debut clean shaven however caused many moviegoers to leave halfway the picture because the portrayal of a schizophrenic man was so believable and uncompromisingly hard that a lot of people just couldn t bear it anymore but because clean shaven was in the first place ment as a serious character study and not so much as an entertainment in fact clean shaven will indeed have very little entertaining values for the average audience it remained unjustifiably an obscure little picture but fortunately people with a good sense of what s real cinema and the depicting of true is not relenting emotions still know there way to these movies anyway and because that still happens every now and then such a movie gets made and gets through note the same director struck back hard last year with keane another movie of a schizophrenic man who suffers from paranoia and hallucnations and which is so effective that we can feel this disturbed man almost breeding down our necks polanskis film here repulsion is another attempt at putting the viewer straight in the mind of a person that s caught in a mental downward spiral and this attempt resulted in a picture that gets a grip on the viewer in such a way that fear disgust and paranoia becomes a part them almost as much as on the character herself catherine deneuve is a young woman who feels at best if she feels something positive at all in a beauty parlour where she is surrounded by women collegues and customers only in the outside world she is a she and withdrawn little girl that shivers with every touch of a man be it accidental or purpously her blank empty eyes show no emotions only when she is scared and even then deneuve s keeps a dead pan face most of the time because she doesn t open up her thoughts and emotons to the viewer like the journalist in shock corridor we do not know where her repulsion and fears come from or where they go but polanski keeps the camera pretty much in her face anyhow and we go along with her stroling through the streets of london or dwelling in her sisters appartment we are not so much voyeurs but more witnesess to something or somebody we rather not be a witness of but like lodge kerrigan polanski is a master in manipulating and menages to keep a hard core of movie fans intrigued his lowbudget like approach and fully use of the claustrophobic surroundings that pretty much literaly speak for themselves desolate sounds of dripping water neuroticly ticking clocks creepy cracking shelves echoes of slamming doors a completely effective realistic way wich he would repeated often like in the tenant and of course rosemarys baby pays off polanski is more then just an exceptional filmmaker he is a visionair halfway through the movie there is no more reason to argue this cannot have a happy end ! but going down that spiral is made here in a rarely seen form of art in which sounds shots plays with light and shadows and a totally convincing actress are stretched to the limits and sometimes boldly go beyond its not fun to witness deneuve s falling apart but it is for every real movie lover to witness this film it s hard harsh rough and daring and therefor all the more to be admired 
magnificent my brother my husband a co worker of my husband and myself think this movie is a superb piece of art chiristian bale batman begins is the main actor at his tender age of thirteen years he delivers such a wonderful performance that makes me think he was born to be the one who would make this film highly recommended movie christian bale lovers baleheads buy the movie have some tissue ready on your coffee table i m a spanish speaking person i hope my english is satisfactory 
informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
hilarious childhood movies reveal a genius in the making i ve never laughed and or smiled so much in my life my face literally hurt after watching this movie the films darren stein the director made with his childhood friends were way more ambitious than anything my friends or i made as a child we pretty much stuck to straight horror whilst darren and company tackled such heady themes as the holocaust child abuse and nuclear war my favorite part a little girl screaming no mommy no in a monotone while her mother beats her the little girl s barely suppressed laughter audible throughout other parts worthy of mention include the concentration camp execution scene shot in a suburban living room and the bank robbery scene also shot in what appears to be the same living room what makes the film really special however is watching a young darren exhibit signs of being a truly manipulative megalomaniacal film director it s sweet and also a little bit scary this film is a must for all artists writers filmmakers and musicians who knew what they wanted to be at an early age 
exciting movie lots of action and beautiful s e i really enjoyed the watching the movie for it s scene with the dragon and i thought the movie was interesting the whole time i ve watched it several times since i purchased it 
an animated treasure what can i say i laughed i cried and that is saying a lot given the fact that i almost never cry especially not over a movie i can remember seeing this in the movie theater when i was a little kid and my interest in the movie has not waned over the years i love it even more now that i am older and can fully appreciate the jokes and themes i loved the songs used to sing them all the time especially quotlet me be surprised quot and i watched it everyday when i was in the th grade afterschool after i watched the disney afternoon and oh if you could only hear the songs why they would set a new standard by which you would judge all childrens songs ! i cried so hard at the end you wouldn t believe i do everytime it teaches kids a lot of morals without being overly sappy or preachy it teaches sharing friendship and loyalty the animation is gorgeous ! i love how they drew and painted the city and it is great to just sit back and ponder what a fabulous job they did on creating the expressions on the characters faces and the adventure ! if there is one thing i love that s adventure and this movie has plenty of it please don t deprive your children of this animated masterpiece that would be a crime in itself 
great film not so great picture quality this is my favourite godard film deserving stars for sure but the picture quality on this version isn t that great perfectly watchable and not really hindering the film that much but i ll be waiting for something better i heard a rumour criterion will be releasing this i certainly hope that s true 
to thine own self be true this is the film adaptation of a best selling novel of the same name by lauren weisberg my daughter who loved the book was home visiting and suggested that we rent the film we did so and really enjoyed it the film is a tightly scripted well directed one with excellent performances the story turns around an aspiring journalist andrea sachs anne hathaway who lives with her hunky boyfriend nate adrien grenier an aspiring chef having just graduated from college andrea is looking for a job and improbably gets one working for a top notch fashion magazine her job is to be second assistant to the editor in chief herself miranda priestly meryl streep a veritable dragon lady before whom everyone kowtows it is a job for which many would give their eyeteeth to have andrea however sees it just as a way station stop to becoming a legitimate journalist as she is not at all interested in fashion as evidence by the way she dresses meanwhile for emily emily blunt the catty and acerbic newly promoted first assistant that lives in fear of miranda priestly her job is her life thrust into the fashion maelstrom and thought of as a size six fatty by all the size zeros with which she works andrea begins to change as the perks that go along with working for such a powerhouse fashion rag become apparent the magazine s stylist stanley tucci ultimately helps andrea pull together a look that serves to quell all criticism about her fashion sense this affects the way she dresses and ultimately the way she acts as she starts emulating to some degree the dragon lady herself moreover the suave sexy and sophisticated christian simon baker who is a serious and successful writer sweeps andrea off her feet as her relationships with her boyfriend and friends start to head south due to andrea s absorption with her career andrea gets a wake up call the only question is whether she will answer it ms hathaway give a coltish and engaging performance as our erstwhile journalist and adrien grenier is appealing as her heart stoppingly hunky personal chef christian baker is dead sexy as the serious writer who has designs on andrea stanley tucci gives a strong performance as the stylist who helps andrea overcome her fashion faux pas emily blunt is terrific as the harried first assistant the standout however is meryl streep her coolly understated low key performance as the ruthless and powerful miranda priestly gives conviction to the adage that less is more her very whisper commands attention as her performance is that powerful and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys top notch acting the film leaves little doubt as to why meryl streep merited an oscar nomination for best actress

god said to abraham kill me a son the wind is in the thorn tree yep there is nothing exceptional to this rambo formula remake they use all the same clich they probably recycles some of the old rambo blood and bullets now you ask why we should watch the rambo rehash well i ll tell you because instead of richard crenna you get tommy lee jones and most of his facial expressions when they are not being hidden behind blood and hair and instead of sylvester stallone who was very good in oscar you get benicio del toro who can look more like a man betrayed than an old boxer the story is as old as the hills l t bonham tommy lee jones is called out of retirement to track down a mysterious person or persons unknown that killed some hunters the person turns out to be a soldier aaron hallman benicio del toro that he trained to kill through a series of mishaps aaron gets loosed and the inept authorities must compete with l t for the retrieval or destruction however l t knows he is to only one to do it so does aaron get away so he can kill again does l t make his first kill or is he really a pusssy catdo the inept authorities realize their limits before it is too late do we come away with any new insights 
onegin i highly recommend this dvd for its superior acting all hands as well as for the spectacular photography scenery and overall quality of presentation a real keeper 
great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch

less thanstunning transfer of perennial jd schlock favorite high school confidential is one of the quintessential s jd exploitation movies produced by veteran sleazemeister albert zugsmith touch of evil girls town confessions of an opium eater etc directed by universal monster expert jack arnold in between the incredible shrinking man and monster on the campus and featuring a handful of zugsmith s usual stock company players among the typically eclectic cast that includes russ tamblyn west side story satan s sadists twin peaks mamie van doren and then hubby band leader ray anthony john drew barrymore johns son and drew s dad jackie coogan uncle fester chaplin s the kid william wellman jr and charlie chaplin jr michael landon hot off of teenage werewolf lyle talbot mel welles mary wickes and custom hot rod designer norman woo woo grabowski its a mystery how zugsmith whose entire career was basically a slow descent into the cinematic gutter persuaded the usually staid mgm studios to underwrite his muckraking scandal pictures jerry lee lewis belts the title tune from a flatbed truck over the opening credits then we re introduced to archetypal smart mouthed arrogant punk tony baker tamblyn already maneuvering to becoming top stud of the local gang the wheelers and dealers on his first day at high school new in town he s living with his inappropriately affectionate aunt gwen mamie van doren who s constantly bothering him for attention tony trades some great heptalk with j i barrymore leader of the w d then flashes a huge wad of bills and sparks a reefer in the principal s office next tony mouths off to prim proper english teacher arlene williams jan sterling who falls for him naturally and barrymore presents an amusing jive talk rendition of columbus s discovery of america to the class just tool off the deep end and dig a little infinity tony looking to graze on some grass has plenty of cash but no connections while j i s girlfriend joan diane jergens is jonesing for a few sticks but has no bread tony finally connects with joan s dealer jukie and later a large baggie falls out of tony s hubcap during a bust of an illegal hot rod race at the airport at the local watering hole run by mr august coogan a beatnik poetess recites the absolutely priceless the future is a king size drag monologue backed by coogan s jazz combo i had an uncle with an ivy league heart he had life with a belt in the back he had a button down brain drag tony eventually sets up a deal for a can of h with the big man the big man turns out to be anti alcohol that stuff is murder on the system but forces tony whos really mike wilson undercover narcotics detective to shoot up as a test before finalizing their deal joan arlene and gwen are all menaced by the drug dealing hoods tony s cover is blown and landon and chaplin lead jocks and club patrons against the ringleaders in the action packed finish the plot is fairly routine stuff the real reasons to watch this flick are tamblyn s dead on irritating wise ass performance as tony and the preponderance of hilarious late s slang throughout one of my favorite moments tony to henchman petey hes a schmo they both nod in unison from kokomo yeah as if everyone knows that this is the standard response ! white zombie used some great samples of hsc s swingin dialogue on la sexorcisto devil music vol while i m glad to finally have one of my favorite jd exploitation flicks on dvd i wish artisan had made the effort to give us a nicer transfer the good news is that contrary to what the dvd case explicitly states the movie is presented in letterboxed widescreen though unfortunately with no anamorphic enhancement the blacks and midtones actually look pretty solid and damage consists of only some light speckling but enlarged to fit a inch x screen the highlight areas show lots of visible grain and the detail is much softer than expected for dvd it s still watchable but looks better unenlarged or on a smaller set it kind of defeats the purpose of buying a projection tv when dvd manufacturers like artisan put out transfers like this one that actually look worse when enlarged to utilize the maximum screen area the box says only digitally mastered leaving room for doubt as to whether it was actually remastered for dvd don t get me wrong it still looks better than the republic artisan videotape with superior tonal values and much improved sharpness and detail so it s worth the investment for fans replacing their blurry vhs but a bit disappointing otherwise and it s unlikely that artisan s ever going to give this film a better restoration if they didn t this time around so this is probably as good as it s gonna get unless somebody like image or criterion puts out a special edition someday there are no extras other than chapter stops not even a trailer i rate the movie five stars the dvd gets three 
nostalgic when an individual buys a movie it is in order to watch it several times unless one is a reseller so to buy a comedy to think that one will laugh at the same jokes a hundered times is foolish the movie is enjoyable due to its excellent cast and quirky humor there is nothing overbearing about the movie which is a nice departure from the majority of movies out there two cast members are now gone the plot is simple the quirks are clever enjoy every now and again when you miss the s its actors and the style of thought you had when you were a kid 
not the best national lampoon s movie funny moments extreem exageration of dorm life taken at face value dorm daze is an exagerated view of dorm life for college kids with its relationships love triagles and the problems gossip that occur while sharing living quarters with so many people initially starting out as a movie following one brother s attempt to get his younger brother some action by purchasing a prostitute it soon becomes one involving mixed up identities and a good bunch of money along the way many characters are introduced the nerdy girl the nerdy guy who secretly love the nerdy girl who is hot the young couple that has goes through a relationship crisis the gossipy girls that spred rumors and jump to conclusions you get the point but the writers did do a fairly good job at pulling all of these characters together into one plot that did have some cohesion to it and actually was quite funny at how things got blown out of proportions a good comedy rental or buy it for cheap here on amazon since rentals cost so much any more caution they have now released dorm daze which makes this movie look like a masterpiece compared to it

a simple plan director sam raimicast bill paxton billy bob thornton bridget fonda brent briscoe jack walsh chelcie ross becky ann baker gary cole bob davis running time minutesrated r for violence and language this is a diabolical tale about the wages of greed although it is played straight without intentional humor the irony is so delicious at times that you might find yourself laughing jacob mitchell billy bob thornton is the one who begins to feel evil and rightly so as the bodies begin to pile up his presumably smarter brother hank bill paxton feels mostly fear as he struggles to cover up one mishap after another their problems begin when they and jacob s buddy lou chambers brent briscoe stumble onto a downed airplane in the woods covered with snow in which they find one dead person being feasted on by crows and a duffle bag full of hundred dollar bills lou who might represent the common man says let s keep it hank who could be rational man says whoa this money belongs to somebody and besides we could get into trouble we better turn it in and jacob who is the natural man sides with his buddy lou after all they re country poor and this is probably drug money that nobody is going to miss and anyway what can go wrong well as ben franklin observed a long time ago three can keep a secret if two of them are dead as they wait for spring to come and the plane to be discovered before they risk spending the money the simple plan begins to unravel with horrific consequences thornton and briscoe play country boys to perfection and paxton does a great job as a small town golden boy seriously compromised bridget fonda plays hank s pregnant wife who turns out to be the brains as it were of the group there are some very nice plot twists as the all too human emotions of the characters begin to crash into one another inevitably we have a morality tale in which the wages of sin are fully realized sam raimi s the evil dead spiderman direction captures well the atmosphere of north country america without any obvious straining for effect he gets great mileage out of a few crows actually some of them are ravens i think and a whole lot of snow scott b smith s script from his novel is clever and morally astute the characterizations are excellent and the story psychologically satisfying particularly agreeable was the very sad ironic end for hank and his wife who find that all the self created hell they went through led them back to where they began but without their souls a dark message about greed and honesty is a topsy turvey roller coaster ride with beautiful cinematography and slick direction from horror master raimi not one for those who need a cheering up session 
you quacked at your teacher ducks fly together the mighty ducks released in is probably the only film that can boast that its theatrical success launched a sports franchise fact or fiction as a movie it found a large enough audience to convince disney studios to follow up with two more installments of mighty duck mania plot self absorbed young lawyer gordon bombay emilio estevez is sentenced to community service for a traffic violation his assignment is to fill in as the interim hockey coach for a local group of underachieving kids coach bombay a former hocky star in the same league years earlier has inherited the worst team in the league can he harness their rebellious attitudes and turn them into contenders maybe even make them good enough to challenge the perennial champions and his old coach formulamatic but lots of fun anyway estevez is surrounded by a strong cast with lane smith as coach reilly heidi kling as casey conway joshua jackson as charlie conway and marguette moreau as connie 
great this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great ! its good to pay less to view 
very true to life great movie all around lucas is a little guy with heart maggie green was very pretty and kind i relly liked how cappie sheen stukck up for lucas and was nice to him i feel i can identify with lucas because i too was a bit of a nerd in high school i had my share of troubles with jocks and was disapointed when girls i had a crush on only liked me as a friend or liked someone else but lucas mananaged to gain the one thing by the end of the film that we all yearn for respect 
adrift on the prairie in a kill happy charlie starkweather and his year old girlfriend caril ann fugate came boiling out of high plains nebraska to terrorize a section of the country that seldom appears on the o clock news behind they left a trail of dead bodies if charlie saw you he killed you with no more thought than throwing away a gum wrapper in the slumberland of s suburbia it was almost as if beaver cleaver had gone mad so what was the point of all the merciless blood letting malick s terrific little movie makes the point that in fact there was no point it really amounted to something to do a way to escape a dead end job with no prospects no respect and who knows maybe other teen agers would make a comparison with that reel rebel idol james dean in a bit of cultural perversity it seems starkweather succeeded the night of his execution young people gathered outside the prison gates in his own way he did make the movies just like his idol this is a disturbing film that thoroughly deglamorizes the two fugitives and is a long long way from penn s bonnie and clyde kit martin sheen and holly sissy spacek are not just callow kids they re dull unimaginative and barely aware of the gravity or consequences of what they do holly lives in a detached world where her story book narration contrasts vividly with the mayhem that surrounds them she shows no tears or remorse for her slain father creating instead little fantasies about a rollercoaster ride with a hellbent type boy it s all really just a fairy tale dream after which she ll wake up and go to the prom boyfriend kit carruthers has all the moral sensibility of a happy golucky clam he kills because he really can t think of anything else to do besides how else could such a hopeless dead ender become an outlaw legend in his own time marking the spot of his capture with an improvised rock pile there s absolutely nothing here to romanticize and it s to malick s credit that he doesn ttoo bad malick disappeared from movie making he had a rare alertness as to how the natural world shapes people s behavior here holly and kit are adrift on the vast empty prairie of the horizonless midwest actually southeastern colorado the dreary landscape stretches out to a nowhere that mirrors the fugitives own inner emptiness and existential void at least the act of fleeing provides proverbial meaning to an otherwise barren existence there are many nice touches notice how kit and alan vint s police deputy develop a budding friendship just a couple of good ole boys who might have gone hunting together except one of them doesn t shoot rabbits in fact the states of nebraska and wyoming treated the spree like a soviet invasion calling out the national guard to reassure panicked civilians malick brings in the guard formations casually and impressively at film s end when the real impact trailing behind these two malt shop fugitives is finally revealed in wholesale killing was still the prerogative of adults only over the years a number of films have been based on this mindless binge in my book malick s remains the most compelling 
camille claudel the movie great artsy passionate story of the lady behind rodin an equally good sculptor who positively influenced the art and productiviity of one of the world s best known sculptors 
top notch workout for bones i m a former gym junkie and lifted weights three times a week for years i must say that skeletal fitness has completely replaced my lifting routine i now have confidence that i m doing everything to stave off osteoporosis for my entire body including areas that my previous routine didn t address such as the wrists i would award the video stars if i could its that good plus mirabei presents herself as the kind of instructor anyone would welcome into her home on a regular basis 
this deserves to be enshrined among the classics this was a story which i had read as a child and unfortunately forgotten about someone recently mentioned it and i could only recall something about a toad and a motor car i also remembered that i had very much enjoyed reading about the toad and the motor car when i was younger so i decided to re read it i was very pleasantly surprised to find that i not only still enjoyed the toad and and the motor car but also his friends rat mole and badger which i had previosly forgotten grahame strangely mixes animal life with human life but he pulls it off very well and produces an extraordinary land where animals and humans co exist as mostly equals almost like in c s lewis narnian chronicles but not quite since the animals wear clothes it actually very much reminded me of c s lewis very obscure work boxen which he created as a child a land where animals wore suits and lived as humans grahame s is of course far better and is a joy to read for both young and old i highly recommend this book 
van damme still has it this film though not a hit proved to people that van damme was back in shape and could still the van damme thing which is kick people s asses i know this was not his best acting but it was a pretty entertaning flick i really wish it had more success at the box office i mean come on it wasnt meant to be an oscar winner its an action flick that has plenty of action nuff said 
stephen king done right based on a short story by horror maestro stephen king the night flier is a prime example of a stephen king tv movie done right genre stalwart miguel ferrer stars as a sleazy tabloid reporter on the trail of a killer who is using a small plane to travel from small airstrip to airstrip and killing the crews he finds there in a way which suggets that this killer may be a vampire bloody visceral and surprisingly smart and faithful to king s story the night flier is king done right and is a dreadfully underrated horror flick the denouement is pure king all the way and is worth the price of admission alone 
if only sometimes you watch a film and it inhabits you it gets under your skin ballad of a soldier is such a film and sometimes a work of art provides an affirmation of what you ve always believed this too is the case with this remarkable deeply moving film from kruschev s soviet union the camerawork is exceptional the black and white tonality is exquisite and even though the tale told could be minimalized by labels such as corny and manipulative and obvious at heart it s a classic story of love desperately trying to survive in the midst of madness it s riveting you can t take your eyes off the screen and it s compelling in that during this film and for days after it the most important thing in your heart will become the hero s reuniting with his love deeply moving and i don t know if i will ever forget this performance by the shimmering zhanna prokhorenko the tragedy of this remarkable film is that it could have been used as an instrument to teach the american people they were being sold a lie by their government that lie endlessly hammered into our heads in grade school and junior high was that the russians don t value life like we do we were taught to view the soviets as grey unattractive potato like people in shabby clothing who wanted to conquer main street america though it was never really explained to us why they would ever want to do that especially after losing over million of their own citizens in the last war oh i forgot they don t value life like we do we were taught there was a missile gap with jfk claiming that the russians had thousands of missiles aimed at our back yards which we now know was an enormous and conscious exaggeration sound familiar if every american had had the chance to see this film in the early sixties and had mustered up the inner strength to speak truth to power the contemporary history of the united states and the world just might have been different you could have shown this film to an audience of farmers and their families in kansas in and that audience would have seen themselves on the screen and they would have wept as they left the theatre the soviet people were not our enemies their government definitely at times was our adversary but the demonization of the soviet people by our leaders and our media was and remains absolutely unforgivable a historical sin a brilliant heartwarming and sad film with a profound lesson not too late for the learning 
great movie i agree with one of the reviews up above about the original korean or china dvd with english subtitles the subtitles are setup perfectly throughout the movie to where you can read and follow a long and no miss a moment of the action this is a great movie if you understand the culture that asia was at this particular time 
the doublest crosser of them all this spellbinding b w flick set in california pits sultry lana turner against john garfield in a neverending love hate relationship which ironically parallels the lives of its stars turner times married dead in at is electrified at first glance by garfield in real life a tough jewish bad boy who was later blacklisted during the mccarthy era and died in at classic scenes in this all american classic include shots in the twin oaks diner owned by the husband lana didn t love including donuts and a steaming mug of coffee full body shots of lana in shorts halter top one helluva beautiful dame and a wonderful love me or leave me scene in the pacific ocean where lana tests the love of the only man she has ever loved according to legend the title of this short james m cain novella had no relevance in the book not so in the movie find out for yourself why the postman always rings twice and why this is one of the greatest movies ever made 
one of the top three movies of the s it s hard to describe what a great movie this was because there s so much that s great about it christian slater s a nerd during the day and runs a pirate radio show at night he s like clark kent and superman he enables the teens to be themselves and lead their own lives and ultimately causes the reversal of educational discrimination at his new school pump up the volume is the kind of movie that will give you goosebumps you ll want to go back in time and relive high school all over again 
brilliant theatre having seen this production both live and on tv it was a must to purchase the dvd there are some critical points but in the main the dramatic power of matthew bourne s chorography coupled with the performance of adam cooper and his corp of male swans it is a frightening depiction of what could have been if pepita had dispensed with his tutu s and shocked the world with a production which would i am sure have met with tchaikovsky s approval i found some of the movement a little ghose particularly the assemble work in the early scenes but the par de dur between cooper and scott ambler must be seen to be believed 
great show for kids we watched this movie and the mighty ducks this weekend and both have similar story themes about the under dogs and both are great movies for kids worth while renting or buying we rented it 
shining brilliant hysterical i had heard of this movie years ago and thought the premise sounded funny but never made any effort to see it i happened to notice it in the video store the other day and when i saw that sean hayes was in it my memory of it came back and i thought okay sure with sean it has to be at least entertaining i really wasn t prepared for how deeply funny sad and brilliant this little film was lets get past the problems first bad lighting amateurish camera angles okay yes but the story about wayward reject april katie holmes who was so brilliant and perfect that i can t understand what has happened to her career oh right tom oops and her desperate attempt to prepare thanksgiving dinner for her estranged family in the most hellish apartment building in nyc is superb some of the lines come out of nowhere and just force you to laugh they are so funny and true and patricia clarkson as the mother with cancer and oliver platt as her loving keep positiveatalltimes husband were just simply outstanding the movie keeps moving at all times and along with its funny tragic plot and its sad little subplot of boyfriend bobby derek luke trying to find a nice suit to impress april s family just takes a hold of you and drags you in to this dysfunctional family s world and insists you go along for the ride whether you like it or not sean hayes did not have the big part i thought he did but indicated without a shadow of doubt his off kilter comic timing that cinched him the part of jack on will grace the only thing that was questionable is why in the world would he have been living in this delapidated hell hole with his purebreed dog and his spanking new oven the other residents including a nutcase vegan a staggeringly funny lillias white as the woman who first lets april into her apartment to use her oven for a few hours and an entire chinese family who patiently listen to april s valiant attempt to explain the history of the united states all of it was just outstanding i loved it loved it loved it did i say i loved it yes you will have to get over the atrocious lighting hello people ever hear of lights and if you have claustrophobia you might freak out at the feeling of being in tight crammed little apartments but if you can get past those things and you enjoy out there humor with a tinge of tragedy you re in for a treat thumbs up all the way

tchaikovsky and riding crops i m not usually a ballet person i haven t seen anything since the nutcracker when i was six but this was absolutely brilliant the concept for it is completely bold and original and adam cooper as the swan blew me away how can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet 
what a great movie how many movies can you really enjoy with the young people in your life this is one of the few i watched this with great reluctance and found myself absolutely loving it ! believe me you really won t be nauseated ! you will laugh 
childish sometimes but still very good i bought this dvd just some days ago and it amazed me christina gives an entertaining show where she both sings and dances and doesn t lypsinch at all the fast songs are catchy and the low ones are beautifully sung with strong emotions and the usual powerful voice of christina christina can sing christina can dance christina can entertain us she may not be the bestest artist of our generation but she is surely underrated and deserves a lot of credits maybe her look and especially her hair were not that good but well a singer is supposed to sing in the first place and i didn t really care about what she looked like 
differences between r rated and rated version regarding the above title there was very little difference between the versions on this edition of the dvd there seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the usa and the uk as they do very little to the film s context still it s a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore if that s what you re into and i d still give it a out of 
wonderful movie this movie is one of my personal favorites it shows how european immigrants in the early th century voluntarily became a part of our country culture and how they appreciated being here as i had european grandparents and witnessed all the family interacting with aunts uncles who were born in this country the story is very true to real life i warmly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see how the immigrants had a strong desire to become a part of the u s society 
very enjoyable i really enjoyed this film and i know nothing about soccer i liked the acting and as a teacher i found the relationshop between cf and his students very heart warming unlike others though i did not like the hair it put me in mind of something large and furry having crawled onto cf s head and died never mind though he looked great otherwise and the performance was surprisingly complex and moving i liked the ending unlike a previous reviewer were you looking for more detail did you miss the point that he could quotmove on quot from his passion to a new one 
you gotta shop at huckabees crude language wild philosophy taken to an extreme the attitudes and language are what makes this movie rated r even though it may seem like all fun and games and you may not want to say otherwise you know it s more than that looking at the title it sounds like it could be another comedic happy go lucky film right about the comedic part but so wrong on everything else there are hearts broken in ways you wouldn t have imagined two huckabee models and everything else huckabees jason schartzman plays the main character and i found out that he s the drummer in phantom planet a great pop band ! i hear he s arrogant though and this fact only would enhance it dustin hoffman and jude law are in it mark wahlberg is truly convincing in this one if you like south park daria or any kind of toilet humor this movie may just be for you 
sparkle review i have loved this movie ever since i was a little girl the dvd is awsome it has been re mastered beautifully 
movies my husband liked this movie so much he said he had to have it if ever came out on dvd he likes sidney poltler good additon to collectio 
enjoyable but frankly my dear id rather be in secaucus i managed to miss this one of those generational impact movies and never caught up to it until now it is difficult to remember that all the cliches were not cliches when this movie was released but i was able to watch it and just enjoy the crisp acting by all stars and of course there is that soundtrack still the movie ripped off the return of the secaucus and tho i havent seen that in a long time my guess is id prefer it on a more core level 
a movie about american heroes i have waited since the advent of dvds for this film to be released this standout movie essentially tells the story of dedicated patriotic public servants and how a bureau was created that became the most effective criminal investigative and counter espionage organization in the world as someone has already pointed out this movie would never be made today and perhaps that is the great tragedy america survived and remained free through the th century because of the sacrifices of men in uniform abroad and men who guarded the safety and security of the nation at home jimmy stewart portrays fbi special agent chip hardesty over a period spanning years from to the s the film unapologetically shows j edgar hoover as the man who remade the bureau in his image as an organization devoted to justice fidelity and bravery since his death in hoover has been slandered in every way possible by people who would never have dared make such attacks while he was alive most of those charges have since been debunked and the makers of this picture have been vindicated many times over you will see fbi agent hardesty investigate the murder of american indians the suppression of freedom of the press by the ku klux klan the murders kidnappings bank robberies of the s road gangsters including dillinger baby face nelson alvin karpis and machine gun kelly the nazi infiltration of latin america during the second world war the wartime fbi included everything from alaska to argentina in its bailiwick postwar treason by american communists working for the ussr and sabotage and mass murder in the first deliberate destruction of an airliner in u s history it doesn t get much better than this this movie includes a compelling supporting cast that no film made today would ever have they include vera miles as stewart s long suffering and sometimes selfish wife nick adams as a young sociopath planning matricide for the airline insurance harley baer as a lazy political appointee who flees the bureau when hoover assumes command murray hamilton as chip hardesty s best friend sam cowley a man dedicated to justice who never wants to cool off larry parnell as young george cowley who fights to be as good a man and an fbi agent as his father and many others this film is a classic that i include among the ten essential films that all americans should see from the hollywood era when the studios made movies that made audiences proud of their country and its values if you are looking for a syriana or a jfk this is a film you should pass over 
pretty realistic i went through the dot com boom and this was totally realistic it chronicles a real world view of what was going on behind the companies insid ethe bubble i think the overall lesson from the bubble is that valuation profits and experience matter this is what the bubble era lacked and this documentary covers it well these guys had no business running a company getting funding and were little concerned with producing a quality product that had longevity shame on them for going into business but moreso for those vc s giving them money so it went from my experience most of these types of people went out of the industry to easier stomping grounds to get their mba s have babies or become accountants some have moved onto the new frontier of other start up areas and have not learned their lesson either however some have learned a great deal from the bubble continue to innovate and are well positioned to be the names of tomorrow 
a classic this is a horror sci fi masterpiece just watch it this film reminded me of videodrome and the fly and a little bit of eraserhead it might not be up there with them but its a classic for sure

twenty years on round midnight still sparkles when i first saw round midnight as a young man i thought dale turner was real jazz musician and wondered what he had done that made him avoid america like roman polanski that s a tribute to the good acting of dexter gordon and the direction of bertrand tavernier who i understand is swiss the tight close ups of the blue note reverberate with sweat and reality recently i had the chance to watch this film in tandem with michael curtiz young man with a horn and i saw some similarities in the way gordon is photographed with the john alton shadows and stripes across his handsome face just as juano hernandez was given almost the noir treatment in the earlier film in the heated nightclubs where everyone wears a cigarette out the side of their mouth and the smoke makes feverish patterns across the whitewashed walls i wish the dvd had included some memories of the film makers including some testimony from tavernier to see if he had really studied earlier american jazz films or not a young french jazz buff grows close to dale who then becomes his idol and shares acting duties in the film just as dale sweats out his addiction to liquor but what he can t shake his love hate affair with new york city and with america as a whole that ambivalence is a factor the young frenchman just can t understand it goes way over his head and leaves him standing on the far shores of love even on the banks of the east river i suppose if this movie had been made in the usa this character francis would have been played by a woman like doris day in young man weith a horn for in the usa men aren t allowed to give each other the adoring looks that francois gives dale in this one given the time period perhaps the part would have been offered to robin givens or lisa bonet as it is we get the incandescent lonette mckee at her finest and singing beautifully too the film goes to great lengths to prove francis solidly heterosexual and pro family with his parents and a cute little daughter david rayfiel who wrote this paean to black white relationships was for years the favorite screenwriter of sydney pollack and also wrote the amazing rape revenge picture lipstick he is a true journeyman and here he gave dexter gordon a part that should have won him the oscar 
a murder wrapped in a social message it still holds up perhaps the first of the social injustice movies hollywood began turning out in the late forties crossfire is one of the few in my opinion which still hold up that s because the social message against hate in general and anti semitism in particular doesn t become too preachy and get in the way of the story unlike gentleman s agreement antisemitism boomerang legal and class injustice pinky racial prejudice and others crossfire tells a taut story first in this case about a murder and features some first rate acting especially from robert ryan the murder mystery is straightforward and there s little doubt about who the killer is we know a man named samuels sam levene has been beaten to death we know the suspect corporal arthur mitchell george cooper is one of four recently discharged soldiers who met him in a bar we know one of the four is a big edgy guy sergeant montgomery robert ryan who laughs too much and likes to verbally poke at people he thinks are weak the body is discovered evidence points to mitchell as the killer and police captain finlay robert young goes to work one of mitchell s buddies sergeant peter keeley robert mitchum doesn t think mitchell could be a killer in a cautious way he starts working with finlay to establish an alibi for mitchell and then to concentrate on montgomery one of the biggest issues is what could montgomery s motivation be it turns out montgomery doesn t like civilians doesn t like hillbillies and hates jews he s a bigot when montgomery complains about those kinds of guys finlay asks what kind of guys you know the kind montgomery says played it safe during the war keepin themselves in civvies nice apartments swell dames you know the kind im not sure that i do some of em are named samuels some of em have funnier names it isn t long before we realize that montgomery is a psychopath who hates just about anyone who is different with keeley s help finlay finally is able to lay a clever trap for montgomery young does a fine job as the cop he s seen probably too much he s tired he s a decent man who relies on his training ive been at this job too long he tells keeley i go about it the only way i know how i collect all the facts possible most of them are useless mitchum laconic but alert makes a nice partner for finlay he s ready to stand by a buddy he thinks is incapable of killing and he really doesn t like montgomery robert ryan makes you feel uncomfortable from the moment you see him there s something too friendly about him something too hidden something too ready to explode you re not surprised when he suddenly beats samuels to death with his fists the difference between the part of keeley and the part of montgomery is i think the difference between a role that can lead to a reputation as a movie star and a role that can lead to a reputation as a movie actor i think it was only when mitchum took on unsympathetic roles in night of the hunter and cape fear that many critics realized he was a first rate film actor not just a star by that time ryan already had the actor reputation but major stardom had eluded him in a smaller part gloria grahame is excellent as a dance hall hostess who might give mitchell an alibi with her cat eyes and pouty lips grahame always was distinctive she and paul kelly as a man who may or may not be her husband bring an uneasy and almost surreal quality to their scenes crossfire is a solid looking noir the dvd presentation is very good 
great movie overall the dvd was excellent and very much appropriate for young children however after a couple of months it had fallen to the back of his preference list we ve not watched it in over a year now i guess this isn t so different from any other dvd we have i would recommend this for young children it does have a few concepts that are not appropriate but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent but is violence in nature very entertaining for the whole family 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out

stand and deliver superbly directed by men ndez for pbs s american playhouse stand and deliver is a cut above most motivational storytelling because it bypasses sentimentality in favor of a more complex authentic tone olmos is a marvel as escalante a brilliant but idiosyncratic educator and he deservedly nabbed an oscar nomination among a dynamic supporting cast lou diamond phillips also impresses as the troubled youth who faces a choice between gang life and academic glory 
i really enjoyed watching it i really enjoyed the lizzie mcguire movie it was light and entertaining but i don t know if i would want my daughter to watch it because it s based on deception and i am really concerned about her not learning the wrong thing lizzie is pretending to get sick so she could sneak out and do other things but for those who already know right from wrong and won t be convinced that lying is ok based on this movie it s entertaining 
steve is the best steve martin is simply the funniest guy in show business a great remake of a classic no one can play characters the way steve can and this movie is sure to entertain one and all 
beastmaster special edition this is a must for purchasing dvds ! this is one movie that should be on dvd and still in the market ! this special edition different from the original dvd release the original dvd release as just the movie this special edition featured full length intewrviews with the cast from they were also pictures of the cast including the witch women they weren t ugly they were gorgous i don t know why the director wanted to place those ugly masks over thier beauty i mean not all witches are ugly ! 
awesome the story is interesting and the characterare querky malone is great i really enjoyed this different movie something that hollywood couldnt and wouldnt put out 
stupendously awful cyborg is perhaps one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the acting is bad even for a van damme film the sets are terribly forced and the plot is simply pointless you will gain nothing from watching this movie even the fight scenes aren t nearly as well choreographed as in bloodsport or kick boxer plus it lacks an old asian man to show our hero the way to defeat young and muscular asian men see bloodsport kick boxer and the quest so why did i give it five stars the truth about this movie is that no more than one minute into it you are hooked it is like a train wreck and you cannot turn away until the full hour and twenty six minutes have passed it isn t even that you are entertained but more like in a trance part of your mind says why am i watching this turn it off while the other says ok that had to be the worst scene in the movie so the next will be better right wrong the ending i won t spoil it is beyond corny and is the capstone on the movie it must be mentioned that in this movie jean claude pretends he is jesus jesus claude unlike the other jesus found an almost miraculous way off his crucifix you simply have to see it to believe it do not spend more than eight dollars on this movie new 
video in time for valentine s since i ordered the video on february th i was so impressed by how fast it arrived at my house less than hours later ! 
luminousity on film i will go out on a limb here and declare this movie the most heartbreakingly beautiful film i ever saw i went to see it when it came out and it continued to haunt me until i obtained my first vcr whereupon it was one of the first movies i purchased the story is told pretty much visually and it is such an old story that the viewer doesn t need any more dialog than there is one reviewer addressed the issue of linda manz s new york accent when the trio of protagonists is supposed to be from chicago but after multiple viewings it became clear to me that these guys have been nomads since day one so it s quite plausible to me that they in fact did come from new york originally richard gere also has a decided noo yawk sound and in the way of migrant workers had only recently called chicago home the opening of the movie old turn ofthecentury stills is rife with the melting pot faces that mostly started out in new york and went where the work was when i need an example of absolute perfection my opinion in cinematography this is the film i would always choose so many isolated shots come to mind a wine glass sitting on a riverbed underwater with a fish swimming by five guys conversing quietly in another language as they walk bundled against winter the panic of animals in a brushfire a burning tractor coming out of a fire at night like a machine from hell as well as spooky ghostly sights of people around a campfire at night on a rivershore faces that you would not normally consider beautiful taking on a luminous quality because of the talent of the filming the story almost takes a back seat to the filmwork although it is nearly a greek tragedy bill linda and abby migrant workers scraping to survive and stay together bill and linda are sister and brother abby is bill s lover escape a situation in chicago bill has inadvertently killed a bullheaded boss by jumping a train loaded down with immigrants and ride to the wheatfields of the texas panhandle where they become just three more harvesters until the owner played with a sweet vulnerability by sam shepard catches sight of abby in the field and falls in love with her bill sees this in his unfocused mind as a way for his little group to advance after he overhears a conversation between shepard and a doctor which suggests that the young landowner is dying bill persuades abby to accept the owner s offer of marriage which to her credit she seems initially reluctant to do reasoning that she can make the guy happy for the little time he has left and then the fortune he has will be all theirs his plan hits a snag over three things a suspicious foreman who loves the landowner like a son and distrusts the trio of migrants right now the landowner seems to hit his second wind after marrying abby and the biggest bad thing abby falls in love with her new husband left out frustrated in the cold suffering unending animosity from the foreman bill does the only intelligent thing he can think of and leaves only to return some time later from there things go very badly this movie gives a real flavour of what the early s must have been like the serendipity of a travelling circus apparently out of gas who land on the owner s property and give performances in exchange for room and board and probably gas these things happened then impromptu little entertainments that seemed to have little relevance to the surroundings but which were eagerly looked for diversions were few and far between folks and at one point the newformed family group runs to meet and wave at woodrow wilson s passing train the ordinary people doing the harvesting though only touched on are clear and real you ve seen these people in town working playing fighting and the pathos of the underclass comes out in something linda manz s character says halfway through in a voiceover youre only here once and you should have it nice this movie is tragic and beautiful with good performances especially from linda manz as the hapless younger sister who is at the mercy of circumstances she is powerless to control and who learns the cruel lesson so many like her had to learn in those days how to survive on your own ms manz pretty much disappeared from film after that and returned to private life too bad she was a breath of fresh air in a lot of ways in fact the only people who really advanced filmwise after this were richard gere and sam shepard although gere isn t as good yet as he could be again my opinion and sam shepard is underused or too preoccupied with his writing i highly recommend this movie to cinematography aficianados and to anyone who likes a good period piece told with great sensitivity and minimal dialog 
very interesting no matter where you sit on the fence with tupac shakur you can t ignore his importance as a artist this video reveals alot of interesting aspects of him through his bodyguard also some studio footage very detailed on point presentation here you won t forget it after you see it 
broadway smash i ve watched this musical so many times and still get a great joy in watching it it s so breath taking with the songs dance s and story line i ve just bought this video and i would recommend it to anyone doris day is my favourite actress of all time and she teams well with gene nelson who is a fantastic dancer 
one magic christmas review one of the must see christmas movies a family oriented movie that will rekindle the christmas spirit in everyone we have this on vcr tape and have watched it so much that we purchased the dvd version enjoy 
great cult classic the first time i saw this film was back in high school over years ago at that time we thought that this was the craziest movie we had ever seen and whoever it was who had written the script and made such an off the wall film was somewhat insane himself yet we were hysterically laughing throughout the entire film upon watching the movie again years later nothing had changed i still found myself laughing throughout the entire movie it was just as off beat as before it is a great cult classic and i would definitely recommend this film to others 
well worth the i love this video and my three yearold daughter loves it too she asks me to play it literally everyday and does the entire thing from beginning to end all by herself it s a great way for me to get some uninterrupted time to myself and to also have her doing something that s good for her and what a great way for her to get exercise on rainy days ! my only complaint is that i wish they had an advanced version i know that my daughter will grow out of this and will want something more challenging but i ve definitely gotten my money s worth out of this video ! i m back to buy another one for my niece 
prepare to laugh yourself silly one of the greatest funny man teams of all time jack lemmon and tony curtis they work so well together ! i only wish they had made more than two movies together the plot is farsical and the characters over the top but it all works peter falk is fantastic as prof fate s sidekick even my father who never watches a movie twice has watched this one over and over don t miss it 
i luuurve it i loave it i luff it this story of three sisters their lives loves and struggles is delight from the beginning to the end along with three unforgettable women hannah mia farrow the eldest sister a devoted wife and mother a loyal sister to sensual lee barbara hershey and artistic neurotic and clueless holley diane wiest a perfect match to allen s characters we meet their actors parents maureen o sullivan tarzans jane mia farrow s real life mother plays the flirting and drinking mother of three sisters there are also three men in the sisters lives elliot michael caine hannah s husband who understands how great hannah is but he is lusting after lee who is with a much older wiser talented but misanthropic and isolated artist frederick here is also mickey woody allen mickey the former husband of hannah a hypochondriac tv producer who lives in constant fear of death and tries to find meaning of life all stories interweave effortlessly and seamlessly showing allen s unique writing gift as almost always in allen s films there are two important characters his favorite place on earth manhattan ny and the music he adores and as always they add to the many many delights of this wonderful sparkling clever ironic sweet funny and dramatic miracle excellent 
if you love trashy cheapie horror oldies and you know who you are this one s for you this is hands down one of the best of the stupid tacky impossibly poorly written and acted teenie bop fifties movies ever it even has a production number puppy love sung by a dreamboat greaser guy later a vampire victim his body discovered along with another unfortunate teen in an unbelievably contrived shot with major bad lighting tacky effects even for the time the same girl tovampire progression sequence repeated endlessly you can also see a string holding the vampire mask onto the protagonist s head in a graveyard sequence i adore this movie yeah where is the dvd 
better than the original kickboxer followed up the first successful kickboxer but minus van damme david sloan played by sasha mitchell is now the focus the apparent rd brother of kurt and eric sloan from the st movie sasha mitchell may not be anywhere as close to van damme in the athletic department but that doesn t hurt kickboxer at all sasha mitchell is a better actor and as a whole kickboxer does a better job than the st movie in that department the story is pretty decent too this time both characters good and evil are out for revenge the evil is tong po who returns from the st kickboxer played by michel qissi he only has one line in the movie and doesn t appear until much later on but it is a grand appearance matthias hues death match blackbelt no retreat no surrender also has a role in the movie fighting david early on in the ring the st of fights in the movie vince murdocco ring of fire to be the best is also one of the main characters who fights tong po the nd fight in the movie this match is all in slow motion but it is the only slow motion fight i have ever enjoyed creating a sense of suspense that supports a main element in the story the final fight of course is between david and tong po which is about minutes in length it is mostly slow motion once again but is still quite entertaining and bloody with broken glass glued and taped to the fists same used in the st kickboxer kickboxer is definetly a van damme classic kickboxer began a different path but in no way did it succeed in being a bad martial arts film i highly recommend this if you want to see some good fights backed by a decent story

out of the box unusual movie this movie defies normal conventions and much of the storytelling is done visually the plot is easy to follow but the real meat of the movie is contained in the visual scenes much like foreign films the cell is much more ambiguous and non literal than mainstream american films you could even say that the plot is pedistrian and cliche but the heart of the movie is how the visuals are executed you are drawn into serial killer carl s mind d onofrios persona disappears and you are left with the madman and the lost vulnerable abused human vince vaughn is compelling enough to carry his scenes and doesn t overact j lo is also low key although i don t think she can convey the complexities of her character she does her job but doesn t go deep enough to make it an outstanding performance beware of strong violent images if you can stomach it though you may see an original beautifully designed film i d rather see gore in this context rather than the low brow slasher horror type flicks 
better then i though it was going to be i really didn t think that raquel welch could hold her own in a western picture however as in the past i was wrong again bandolero has a star studded cast that featured james stewart who played the role of mace bishop dean martin plays the role of dee bishop raquel welch plays the role of maria stoner and george kennedy plays the role of sheriff johnson dee bishop and his gang of outlaws try to rob a small bank close to the border of mexico while in the process their caught and are supposed to be hung for enters mace bishop who portrays himself as the hangman here to a job bishop arrives in town with the intention of freeing a gang of outlaws including his brother from the gallows mace urges his younger brother to give up crime the sheriff chases the brothers to mexico while on their way towards the border they take maria stoner as a with them they join forces however against a group of mexican bandits who mortally wound both brothers watching raquel body bake in the mexico heat and sun made this picture worth it 
a real thriller i love this movie and it is the type of film that was made a long time ago that is just creepy enough to be fun rather than nauseating thesuspence level is great and the performances especially ethel barrymore s are first rate it s really very enjoyable 
just a minor correction mrs kennedy was not trying to help the secret service agent when she crawled out onto the trunk she was trying to recover part of her husband s skull that had blown back onto the trunk which by the way indicates that he was shot not from the school book depository behind him but from the front right 
cuba is the best just as good as i remembered ! i have spent yrs trying to find this film as i first saw it on sky tv everytime i described it to someone they tried to point me to outbreak ! anyway basic plot outline is a good old goverment conspiracy and the good guys cuba gooding jr and co trying to outwit the bad guys omar epps and cronies the only problem that some might find with this film is the fact that its not as polished as the hollywood blockbusters but it is a made for tv movie overall i m glad i managed to find this film as i really enjoyed watching it again 
downloading is easy csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i ve only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it s certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great 
strange but true this film had a powerful effect on me of the people i know don t read books i met a millionaire not long ago who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life lady di was reported never to have read anything except perhaps fashion mags my children hardly read and their husbands and wives certainly don t my ex wife never read anything her father thought ulysses was a dirty book i stopped watching television in and i own books but not fahrenheit which i d read about years ago this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury s text but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear and with a very solid punch to the plexus the manner in which it is written played and directed added to its impact this world of sleep walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us the style was strange but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal people live and work like automated morons they can t think for themselves and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied they can t conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind in fact present them with an idea or attempt to initiate a discussion and they ll often become angry some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts ludicrous suggestions remake it with mad mel gibson have infantile spielberg direct it bulk it out with computerised sfx these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub humans which the film targets and many of them seem unable to understand their own language let alone write it or spell it this is a memorable film for those whose memories still function unlike the captain of the firemen 
my left foot a must see for all there are so many wonderful reviews already written here i will only say that if you happen to be a person who saw this film way back when it was first released please do yourself a favor and watch it again i think it takes some maturity to really appreciate all that is given in this inspiring true story daniel day lewis is probably the best actor we have had in the last years when you realize how he approaches his craft and really lives his roles and becomes a part of the person he depicts it is amazing to see the portrayals mr day lewis presents in any and all of his films again i didn t appreciate this film as i should have the first time i saw it and am so glad i picked it up and watched it again i will continue to watch it from time to time because it offers so much with regard to the human spirit and loving protection and support in this family please take time and really watch this again you forget daniel day lewis is acting what a talent ! 
why i get straight quotasquot in english i love this video ! my mom bought it for me and my siblings when i was in second grade i fell in love immediately i still watch it just for old time s sake the tunes are so catchy that i still remember all the words for years whenever i had a question on adverbs for instance the song from this video would come to mind this is also partly why i got a on the verbal section of my psats last year ! if you buy this you ll never regret it 
excellent movie great reminder of the time very funny great music great actors just worth it in every way 
a great christmas story my daughter read this story in nd grade and now as a young working professional enjoyed it all over again there is a lesson to be learned by both young children and adult viewers alike i recommend this as a story to be shared with families at the time of year when our attention turns to how many and how much but this story jolts us back to the real spirit of sharing and caring 
kama sutra wow everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask mature audiences only please 
simply beautiful i never heard of this film until i saw it on somebody s amazon list i read many reviews and decided to give it a try wow what a film the story is quite simple a group of kids living in a new city eager to attract new investment and that s it no movie theaters no malls no parks nothing and they are there on their own then all things start to happen the planners just forgot that a quarter of the city s population was under anyway it is rare to see a film with so many kids delivering electrifying performances and matt dillon and michael kramer do leave you in awe they re so so so good that i wonder why isn t this film considered the classic it is this is one of those small films where everything on it is big cinematography top notch this film has one of the best cinematoraphy jobs i ve ever seen on this film the image really speaks there is one scene when the protagonist is being hunted when he spends the night in an empty house with the girl he likes it s early morning the sun is just rising they say goodbye and the most beautiful sunrise outside is framed by the doors simply one of cinema s great moments i am one of those people who hate intelectuals who look for the meaning of every scene of every film they see and here is one scene that trully gives the viewer some space for interpretation it really made me cry and that is great screenwriting period music score again another fine work the kids only listen to s rock but that s just diegetic music here and then but the music score you ll listen when we get deep into the story is absolutely beautiful rich and powerful it is not just there instead of silence it really contributes to showing the emotions those kids are going through and mr kaplan does know where to put the camera he really knows what he wants us to see it is true that being from some situations are dated some problems are dated some conflicts are dated but that only makes this film more valuable as a document about what it was like to grow up on that part of america at that particular time still this film aged a lot better than other better known films about the generation gap this is a film to be studied i strongly recomend this film it s a gem ! 
worth every minute if you don t like to watch foreign films because of the subtitles then you re depriving yourself of great tales such as this one every minute the viewer gives to this film is more than repaid under the rays of a stalinist sun a story of tragic heroism becomes illuminated against the fertile landscape of communist russia the threads of a few seemingly disconnected lives weave together to provide a portrait of characters in various stages of maturity the pitiful self destructive bitterness of a talented young man the guarded confusion of a young wife preoccupied with doubt the grace under fire of an anti hero learning to accept and savor life and the innocent precocity of a little girl caught in the middle of it all the stark brevity of the language which is utilized masterfully by an excellent cast lends a heartbreaking poetry to the backdrop of a common wealth among comrades the director then brings this script to life with scenery choices and visual tricks that would make any baby filmmaker drool all in all this was one of the films that helped to form me as an artistic person and i am certain that it will move anyone who draws breath 
the most surrealist film of john huston once upon a time in texas a roguish judge roy bean magnificent acted by paul newman and also a weird preacher anthony perkins and an albino gunman named stacy keach blend this cocktail and you will obtain a clever ironic and unencumbered film winking to luis buuel watch this hidden and treasured movie 
enlightening what i loved about this movie is that jeffrey wright showed the emotional and sensitive side of basquiat as well as his creative side it showed his struggles with his personal life as it overcame his professional the characters were so real so human and true to life in that time i really enjoyed this movie it pulled me into his life only i wish i knew more 
fools rush in dvd newcomer fort apache looks great with minimal wear on its crisp black andwhite images from original nitrate elements and bugle brisk audio the film ironically finds henry fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against john wayne s humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice the single dvd has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film a shame it does include a minute piece on monument valley covering ford s significant and seemingly beneficial role in the indian reservation s history the navajo paid good wages for their appearances called him giant soldier ive kissed more babies than a politician ford said part of his vision of the world was that we re all very small in the scheme of things film historian joseph mcbride says i think monument valley gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along 
heads up for adoptive families i didn t know what this movie was about until we sat down to watch it with our yearold son who was adopted from russia i didn t know it would involve an orphan girl an orphanage adoption etc this isn t the central theme of the movie but it does exist for my son s age it ended up being appropriate and fine in fact we talked a little about the little girl wanting a mommy and daddy and that she wanted to be adopted so that was a good topic for us to talk about however i didn t like the topic of other children being adopted because they were prettier or whatever it makes it sound like a child s worth is only based on their specific qualities instead of an unconditional love that a parent has for a child and the orphanage topic could be disturbing for some children who did spend time in an orphanage but in the end the little girl was adopted and got a mommy and daddy ! it made me want to cry aside from these more serious details it was a great story ! 
simon and garfunkel central park abeautiful concert in the heart of manhattan n y i know beacause i was there i was employed in new york during the s and s it brought back memories as well as some old tunes 
hellraiser hellbound it was better then the first it shows clips from the first to remind you or if you never saw the first tell you what was important kirsty s stepmom comes back to life from blood where she died and it was cooler then frank in the first movie tand she has a man bring in women so she can kill then and become human again and there s bodies hanging from chains all over the room that she killed in which was cool it diddn t take the wole movie for her the become whole again like the first movie did with frank which was good i don t even think it took five minutes you got to see everyones personal hell this time which was really cool frank was in his hell being tomented which was kind of dumb because he diddn t seem in pain or going mad you learn that the cenobites were human once even pinhead ! pinhead has pins in his head because that how he was tortured when he died but there s a new tourturer that kills the cenobites and in the end of the movie the cenobites come back to life and start living off blood they ll be back to there old ways in no time 
jesus of nazereth dvd excellent movie on the life of christ well done and mostly holds true to the gospel accounts recommended for anyone interested in christianity or even those interested in knowing what it is all about a great resource for those who need visual aid to reading the gospels the setting for the movie is very realistic with great acting to go along with it besides being the greatest story ever told it is also one of the greatest versions of the story 
sometimes its not enough merely to teach one has to punish as well few films come along that i watch and say yeah that s exactly right that s exactly how i feel the magic christian is one of them its a perfect satire of our culture and perfectly relevant today as it was then peter sellers and ringo starr are well suited to each other in this off kilter satire of a billionaire looking for everyone s price why to prove a point to punish as well as teach some may disagree with me but i think the movie outdoes the book by some miles in fact we have tv shows dedicated to just this fact don t people eat bugs on fear factor or survivor do horrendously awful things for that all mighty dollar yes sir guy grand a grand guy sellers and his adopted son youngman grand starr commit the ultimate heresy by faking a gigantic luxury liner for the cream of society only to mess with their heads with gorillas christopher lee in full dracula gear and yul brenner in drag singing mad about the boy to roman polanski in short this film is dangerous and brilliant ps to the reviewer who mentions the beatles john isn t in it its a double and paul isn t singing he just wrote the song for badfinger unfortunately i can t give it a five for two reasons much of the dialogue is adr d and sellers can t give quite the subtle performance he might have done ala strangelove another southern writing project the dvd is pretty much a slap dash full screen copy of the crappy version that was out on vhs for years i hope one day they put out a good version

when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
freaky show this movie is about a boy who gets badly insulted at a school dance in junior high he ended up getting beaten up by a bunch of macho boys and all the popular girls who asked him to dance are all forgiven and there isnt any consequences many years later they all become succesfull people struggling with work and relationships when one of the friends turns up murdered at the hospital where she works they start to think that the boy that they insulted as come back to get them they dont remember what happened to him and have no idea to what he looks like denise richards marley shelton jessica cauffell jessica caupshaw david boreanaz and katherine heigl star in this terrifying movie the good thing is you get to see denise richards character paige prescott in a bikini soon the killer starts attacking all of the girls in a mask in bizarre places for example in a jacuzzi at the spa in a morgue while doing an autopsy in an art gallery when taking a quick break the deaths are pretty vile and brutal there is lots and lots of blood spilled everywhere you can tell this movie was filmed very quickly and rushed into release the attack of the killer is very predictable and there is only one twist at the end when marley sheltons character finds out that her boyfriend played by david boreanaz was the one who was behind all the masked killings even though she was friends with them he let her live because she didnt hurt his feelings at the dance denise richards character bites the dust hard i believe its after the art show when she goes to take a bath in the jacuzzi the killer attacks her with a nail gun and tries to suffocate her she shows a lot of ressistance to the killings but he still shows no mercy the nail goes right into her shoulder and then finally the kille throws the gun into the water which electrocutes her it was very scary but the movie itself isnt scary it wasnt as bad as urban legends final cut or i still know what you did last summer it was still a very good movie over all this is not a movie to watch on valentines day its a movie to watch around halloween and isnt really meant for kids below this is a teen slasher flick but it is indeed violent and it can easily scare people parents trust the r rating on the back and dont let them watch it its mainly for adults to laugh over the weird thing is that denise richards was listed first on the credit line up and she was rd to last to get killed it was bizarre but still this movie was really good and not really scary it was like a freaky sho 
classically funny you will love this film it is like a real life spy v spy ! good movie for a good price 
technically a b movie but has the heart of an a this has been one of my favorite movies for as long as i can remember even when i was young and i didn t understand all the jokes but when i recently rewatched it well my love of it was rediscovered this is a film that basically takes a pridictable and unoriginal story of two people trying to succeed in their sport and end up falling in love and makes it instantly memorable for its snappy dialogue and fun one upmanship of the main characters this film would be worth it for some its insults alone ! overall i would say it is a diamond in the rough but if you are looking for a serious film then this might not appeal to you the cutting edge is pretty much a fun filled romp from start to finish 
the last picture show review a fine picture about life in a small texas town easily a classic if they would give the added footage back to the directo 
arthur th anniversary show this two parter commemorates the th anniversary of the arthur show on pbs it s nice they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it really the only thing that specifically makes this a th anniversary show is the fact that there are s hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how marc brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books it s nice to see them both together too episodes i think they aired them seperately on tv 
a blast from the past this movie is one of my favorite movies i have fond memories of my brother and i watching this movie over and over and every time wishing we could fly like the rocketeer i highly recommend this movie to anyone who s ever loved an adventure story set high in the skies plus jennifer connelly and billy campbell are wonderful fun 
great popcorn muncher this film is in no way a classic but and thats a big but this film is very entertaining and has great replay value washington is a superb actor and although this is not his bet work he does quite well alongside the charming and scene stealing eva mendez and sanaa lathon as well as supermans dean cain the plot revolves around a murder that points directly to florida detective washington since he made some bad choices in the days proceeding so it s a race against time to clear his name and move the evidence away from him as i said it s not perfect and the plot is a littel shakey but the acting is on point and the action is in your face so out of time delivers in the fun factor and will have you watching intently as you enjoy every frame 
bergmanite i saw this on turner classic movies and this along with the seventh seal made me a bergman fan for life it s a film about an old mans mortality he goes to receive an award and the film takes you through the process of his life the script was written just for this man and he is superb ingrid thulin the daughter inlaw is a magnificent actress and is great i recommend it highly if you want bergman s best films buy this one and seventh seal virgin spring through a glass darkly box set smiles of a summers night the magician cries and whispers magic flute fanny and alexander you won t regret it 
another good csi ny though csi ny is most least favorite of the three csis they still manage to make a good one sometimes this is one of those good ones 
truly a gift for your dvd collection the gift is a riveting very well acted movie about a woman named annie blanchett who still has not yet gotten over the death of her husband and struggles to raise her young sons she gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town one of her clients swank who you can always count on for a remarkable performance has an abusive husband reeves fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here who thinks what annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again then the daughter holmes of an important man goes missing she s engaged to a man named wayne who works at the school where annie s boys go i believe he is the principal but i could be mistaken sorry but in any event played by greg kinnear but there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale and soon the police with no clues as to where the daughter is turn to annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction i won t spoil the rest of it for those that have not seen the gift look for an amazing giovanni ribisi in the substory as well hes terrific here if you enjoy thrillers and are intrigued by the plot the gift is something you will surely treasure as i have even if you question the validity of psychic readings this is a very interesting movie that s best viewed with an open mind very recommended

probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out

a beach culture classic i was a surf grommet growing up in the mid s this flick touched on vietnam in ways that i could begin to understand when leroy the masochist gary busey shambles into the draft board whilst combing his hair with a dead fish the surreal and insane nature of vietnam becomes crystal clear this is a true surf epic directed by a guy who knows the territory the surf footage for a hollywood movie is truly outstanding there is even a cameo appearance by mr pipeline himself gerry lopez 
sweet revenge evil dead s director sam raimi tim burton fave composer danny elfman and oscar winner frances mcdormand contribute to elevate this comic book style vendetta drama liam neeson oscar nominee for schindler s list plays a mild mannered scientist who is attacked by a bunch of thugs after incriminating documentation held by neeson s girlfriend mcdormand left for dead he manages to get resuscitated by cameo jenny agutter and he embarks on continuing his experiments which dealt with reconstruction of human skin this also includes vengeance on the men responsible for his attack neeson s performance is a little over the top think vincent price but mcdormand is very good as the girlfriend and colin friels and the irrepressible larry drake two time emmy winner for la law shine as the nasty villains directed with flair by the accomplished raimi darkman is one of the earliest vendetta flicks and it still packs a pretty good punch watch for raimi fave bruce campbell in a cameo at the end 
genius whether people like him or not there s no doubting that this man is a musical genius ! he started his career as a rock star aiming his music towards white teens but everyone of all races and ages was curious as to who this little man was when he realized how much attention he could get from people just by being different he figured why not try different things like movies if you re from the s then you have at least seen out of the three movies that were made and you owned at least one album i loved him then and still do today and i m not alone i ve been to his recent sold out concerts don t hate because he s different learn to embrace and appreciate the differences !

great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch

never explain never apologise this is yet one more brilliant film in the lynch universe i ve loved everything he s done even twin peaks firewalk with me and he seems to get better with each film this film was originally a tv pilot but it was rejected by abc as too weird that really isn t too surprising so david got additional funds and made into one of his best films i don t want to hear any explanations of what actually occured in the film all i know is that it did occur and i felt it whatever it was that s good enough for me and the rest of the world even roger ebert liked this film even though i think it was because the majority of critics adored it and ebert didn t want to be in constrast to the crowd ebert has always been hostile to lynch s work the performances are superb all around with kudos going to justin theroux as the director who has a great scene with studio heads about the girl love the golf club ! i m looking forward to inland empire a hour helping from mr lynch lovely 
it really is quite good just another comment that this is a much betterthanusual made fortv movie quality acting by rea 
highly amusing nautical comedy i had been told that this screwball naval comedy included every submarine film cliche known to man and noted that it had not been a particularly huge hit when it came out ten years ago but as the hero was played by kelsey grammer frasier i thought it would be worth picking up a pre viewed copy to throw into my computer drive to enliven the last minutes of a four hour train journey in the event this film was vastly better than i had expected and the other passengers must have wondered what i was laughing at grammer plays lieutenant commander tom dodge a highly talented but utterly unconventional submarine officer whose sense of humour and far from by thebook attitudes have placed him in grave danger of being passed over for command of his own boat the film opens with a fierce debate at a promotion board at which rear admiral graham bruce dern who has taken a particular dislike to dodge argues that he is too maverick a personality to be trusted with command of a nuclear submarine but there is a compromise on offer graham s superior vice admiral winslow rip torn who is not quite so prejudiced against unconventional officers if they get the job done has noticed that the former soviet union is selling off old diesel summarines in job lots to tin pot unstable countries like iran and iraq quite a prescient point given that this film was made five years before admiral winslow wants to test the possibility that the ultra sophisticated high tech units deployed to defend the us coast against equally sophisticated attackers might make mistakes if faced with a much lower tech but crafty opponent particularly if the enemy captain is highly unconventional or in his words a pirate so they give dodge command of an ancient rustbucket of a diesel submarine called stingray and invite him to see if he can get past all the much better equipped defenders of two key naval bases admiral winslow has a soft spot for dodge and gives him a green light to ignore the rules the way a real rogue attacker would admiral graham is determined to humiliate him and does his best to make the stingray s task mission impossible he starts by assigning dodge a crew from hell of oddballs and misfits these include a mad martinet martin pascal rod schneider as his xo and lieutenant emily lake lauren holly the first woman ever to serve as diving officer on a us submarine but who has no previous experience outside a simulator almost all of the crew have a combination of strengths and weaknesses for example the sonarman nicknamed sonar harland williams has absurdly good hearing but is a very odd character and rather too prone to saying what he thinks fortunately for the stingray sonar s last captain got rid of him despite his enormous skill at the job because he thought sonar was a security risk other members of the misfit crew are played by harry dean stanton ken hudson campbell toby huss duane martin jonathan penner and bradford tatum and they work together brilliantly the cast obviously had a lot of fun making this tom dodge has to weld his peculiar crew into a team and take on an opposition which is determined not to give him an even break he tries every trick that s not in the book to get past them apart from the crew of stingray and the two admirals one other performance of note in the film is given by william h macy as captain knox of the uss orlando which was tom dodge s last sub before being given command of the stingray the stingray keeps running into the orlando and having to get past her on her way to the objectives of the exercise macy gives a brilliantly understated performance as a competent but unimaginative officer who has to display great reserves of self control as he keeps falling foul of dodge s maverick tricks but you have to feel sympathy for captain knox as he holds on to his professionalism something at which admiral graham is rather less successful there are a fair number of things in this film which could only ever happen in hollywood and not in real life but although it is very funny and silly you can suspend your disbelief most of the time i found this film laugh outloud funny and srongly recommend it ps don t turn your dvd player off as soon as the credits start to roll there is an amusing comic video clip accompanying the credits and cast list which is worth watching and listening to it shows kelsey grammer as dodge peering through the periscope at various cast members including himself double take annie talbot in her underwear and some highly musical singing sailors who i think are actually pop stars dancing around the deck of the stingray 
more intense than the first one abs of steel uses most of the same exercises from abs of steel but increases the reps speed and duration of them she also adds modified push ups to the routines a definite all around workout for the abs great for at home solo training 
un box revisited this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i don t see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in mb bites each hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy 
sometimes it s good to be bad boy i sure do love this movie ! that s quite a statement as i generally don t care a whole lot for westerns this one is a bit of a different sort of western however we get to see madeline stowe mary stuart masterson and andie mcdowell all in one film ! i ve never cared much for drew barrymore but i concede she does a pretty good job in this movie madeline stowe still looks good today but this movie was made in when she was the very apex of her beauty on top of being gorgeous having a mystery about her which intoxicates me so she is also a bona fide accomplished actress it s great to see her go from a naieve woman in the last of the mohicans to being a tough asnails no nonsense cowgirl in the present flick she is a much more diverse actress than most women in hollywood now if only she d agree to a candlelight dinner with me anyway this dvd has often been thought of as a female version of young guns well perhaps however in my mind bad girls is the far more entertaining of the two i found young guns rather boring also one nice thing about the film is that it is not a film that s just set about to glorify male bashing while it does set about to accurately depict examples of unfair treatment of th century women it never becomes preachy moreover our cowgirls stumble across some nice fellas who help them out if you like westerns you may or may not like this one if you like un conventional westerns where the main characters are pretty girls not too many other movies can compete in this category then this movie is a must it was filmed in texas and california some of the screen shots had gorgeous scenery and a few of the sets really made me feel like i was back in the old west 
unique time traveling tale from germany people like me who lived through the fall of the berlin wall but were a little too young at the time to be paying much attention will like this blast to the past much of the wit is summed up in one of the scenes which is only seen in the deleted scenes when the lead character s friend mentions his situation is a little like the delicate situation in back to the future a big hit that was just reaching the eastern bloc at the time the movie is set the tale revolves around a boy who has to keep the past alive for the sake of his mother s health and it illustrates both the excitement of those who experienced the west for the first time and the betrayal in this case felt by his mother of those who upheld the former regime it s a clever look at social change in general and a bit of history that hasn t yet been seen often in film i loved it 
the best movie of the s word s can hardly desribe the genius film it is without a doubt the peak of mystery romance action and pure cinematic brilliance the fantastic screenplay perfectly shows how equally amazing elmore leanord s book is to the movie it is also by far john travolta s best role ever and without him the movie would be nothing this film is perfect for everyone the alluring plot amazing acting entertaining screenplay it is truly a gem 
sibling rivalry duane bradley kevin van hentenryck checks into the hotel broslin in nyc w his incredibly deformed psychic and psychotic brother belial together they plan on hunting down and killing the quacks who surgically separated them years earlier this is done in gorey detail with splashes of hysterical humor tossed in ! i especially enjoyed the demise of dr kutter check out her identical twin nurses actually this movie is about the love between two brothers and the jealousy anger that develops when one of them falls in love there is a certain warmth beneath all that goo ! along the way we are treated to many scenes of mutilation and depravity as only frank henenlotter can deliver the last minutes or so are downright disturbing i think basket case is a classic and recommend it to anyone w a taste for the outrageous and bizarre 
great this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great ! its good to pay less to view 
romance and intrigue amid squalor and poverty guy hamilton is an opportunistic australian journalist looking to make his name in indonesia so that he can go on to bigger and better things hamilton played by mel gibson is lost amid a foreign culture and political machine so competely alien to him and gets help from billy kwan played in a cross gender role by linda hunt an educated native who is desperate to do something about the rampant poverty he sees every day the two develop a partnership guy supplies the words and billy the images however their partnership undergoes strain due to their contrary aims guy wants to break the story of communist aggression and insurrection while billy wants to blow the lid off of the poverty in his country guy s response is that people don t want to hear about starving kids things are complicated when guy falls for a british diplomat sigourney weaver whose beauty and brilliant performance make up for a marginal british accent who gives him the story he wants but broadcasting it may just be bad for everyone at end of the movie everyone has committed themselves to what they feel is important and for some it isn t what one would initially imagine them choosing this is another s gem from peter weir who is simply brilliant in setting up an utterly realistic impoverished indonesia circa the acting as i mentioned is excellent gibson has rarely been better and weaver is one of the greatest living actresses today linda hunt got much recognition for the role of billy but this is no gimmick or oscar bait performance hunt shows a compelling portrait of betrayed patriotism weir as in gallipoli shows a weakness for the music of the times and there is some s synth in the movie again this time from vangelis other than this though this is a movie which is compelling all the way through and comes highly recommended from this viewer 
sit down evil dead dead alive based on a story by h p lovecraft this campy send up follows an egotistical medical student jeffrey combs who develops a serum that revives the dead together with his girlfriend and his obdurate roommate combs reanimates a corpse but doesn t factor in certain complications that arise filled with equal parts laughter and gore re animator spawned a similarly outlandish sequel classic gorefest classic it never lets up just when you think you ve seen it all it tops you tongue incheek all the way as funny as it is ghastly stuart gordon has never made a film quite as outlandish and nerve rattling as this one although from beyond was great in a more cerebral vein when i walked out of the theatre on first viewing reanimator i was literally vibrating nerves frayed exhilirating in a very twisted way this is a how a real horror comedic gory movie is suppost to be done 
careful no subs or close captioned contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has no subtitles or closed captions or whatever the r neither so again don t feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff non anamorphic or simply format no subs not available at all yes i mean you disney in short no quality or consistency go and take a hike stop lobbying for legislation and start making real dvd s 
the general s daughter a taut well made thriller with a lot of nuance and details that make seeing it a second or third time equally enjoyable strong acting keeps one s attention to the flow of the story the glimpse into military politics is also illuminating and it s one of the best movie scores i ve heard in a long time it s nice to hear that blend of music anywhere these days 
a film you have to fully understand evolution to fully get having read tons of books and articles on the subject of evolution i understand this film very much i know some who understand evolution far less well will certainly be confused by the intricate plot concerning the big e as for other complaints by amazon reviewers i ll say this i find the acting in this film anything but hollywood like this film reminds me a lot of fatal attraction and other rather realistic s hit films this movie had very realistic acting the dialogue in this movie has profanity true but it is delivered in a very sophisticated educated and realistic way not cheap like in s rambo movies realize most of the characters are professors and doctors and such therefore it is extra cerebral dialogue blair brown is much sexier than william hurt hurt s character in a big scene goes back to the beginning of mankind and discovers how without love a little anger happiness and otheremotions life is unbeliavably drab indifferent and purely a technicality that s why he quits the search why do so many insist it s a cheap ending hurt s character quits happily embracing earlier stages of mankind upon realizing that man is not actually ultimately god and as just a single cell there s no feeling at all no control etc for people people are better off in their current multi celled state therefore he successfully fights all regressions off in the end a power he really had all along because it is no good and this realization makes him appreciate his loving and sexy wife all the more hurt s character goes to mexico not south america like some posters think

great all round film i first saw this film in i loved it the first thing that grabbed my attention was the brothers and their relationship throughout the film and how it changes the storyline with the youngest brother marshall was great the film is like an adventure story the type you would of loved to have gone on ! traveling being young free and inexperienced at almost everything its a bit like a coming of age film finding yourself etc this all sounds heavy but its not the film is filled with humour from the brothers and all the other characters the animals are great and some even get in on the humour too the music even grabs me the whole thing is a feel good factor of a film one i would recommend anyone watching of any age 
it can happen probably one of steve mcqueens greatest movies only this one can happen 
songcatcher captures the heart songcatcher starring a wonderful ensemble cast including janet mcteer aidan quinn and emmy rossum in what i believe is her debut performance is a beautiful emotional masterpiece beautiful cinematography rich well developed characters and stunning bluegrass music combine to make this film a new classic quinn is as impeccable as ever in this another of the period pieces which seem to be his forte the story lines are both moving and beautiful and demonstrate how far one will go to preserve the past as well as how far yet another would go to destroy what he cannot understand not for the youngsters adult themes and brief nudity songcatcher is an intellectual and entertaining film for the mature movie viewer which in this reviewer s opinion was an oscar worthy effort 
roots of the wu tang this movie narrowed down for me where the wu got some of their material from this movie shows the master of the kung fu gordon liu awesome flick if you like the wu tang and if your a true kung fu fan 
looks like its going to be one of those days jerry three o clock high is one of the best s teen films there was unfortunately it didn t seem to attain the instant cult status that other films of similar theme like fast times at ridgemont high and ferris bueller s day off did nearly years after its release three o clock high is still a film that is classic in every aspect of s high school antics on the big screen with big hair colorful clothes and an instrumental soundtrack from tangerine dream the film takes us back to the day jerry mitchell met buddy revell buddy revell played by richard tyson who in film would later go on to be a pilot in black hawk down a sinister villain in kindergarten cop and an intense detective in theres something about mary is a new kid in school the problem is he s a problem child he s big mean and has been known to go ballistic when people touch him revell arrives at this new high school amid a swarm of urban legends and hallway gossip that strike fear into the student body jerry mitchell is a kid who works at the school bookstore has an occult obsessed girlfriend who is more wannabe than weird and a friend who works on the school paper with him the friend is in charge of finding someone to to interview buddy to find out more about him through an accidental meeting in the bathroom jerry conveys the papers intentions to buddy which by now has held a sneer so long he is being compared to charles manson jerry makes the mistake of patting buddy on the shoulder and the rest is history buddy informs jerry to meet him at pm so that they can fight the problem buddy looks like a large axe murder while jerry resembles more of a kid who is on his way to becoming an accountant or something the rest of the day plays out in a series of bizarre events that are wrapped up in some high school fact as well as teenage spoof reel jerry goes through a variety of antics to get out of the fight and in the process slowly turns his own good image into one of trouble by noon the entire school not only knows of the fight but also is taking bets on how long jerry will last it appears jerry is doomed and as he continues to try and do everything he can to change things the acts only backfire to keep him within the walls of his high school till the sound of the final bell the movie does an excellent job in the execution of the overall filming as it does many quick zoom shots as well as odd angles to add to the uniqueness of the overall experience we see as jerry goes about his day the film is nostalgic but not too cheesy on the time period of the s which is easy to scoff at now the attention of the film is centered on the characters and the storyline a bit more than others of its genre from the school disciplinarian resembling a prison warden to the constant guilt trips the principal plays on jerry about his permanent record being marred its idealisms and humor are easily recognizable tyson is superb as the scary imposing bully type student while casey siemasziko does a great job portraying the small pale student named jerry mitchell who despite having a bad day ends up finding out what its all about to stand up for yourself a classic s film that never ever got the credit it deserved 
a great old film this is a funny movie i saw the play recently and it was fun to see the original version highly recommended for anyone who remembers vaudeville fondly or likes charlie chaplin movies phil silvers was great 
good for a little wacked monster movie notice to parents there is some verbal material unsuited for little ones adult nature a woman grows to ft placing an extra strain on a strained marriage daryl hanna and daniel baldwin this is a light monster film not gory it is good for that it carries some laughs punny stuff and summer flick character no deep story folks 
the folksmen rule when chevy chase came back from hollywood to host snl in its second season the other snlers were mad at him he was the only snl player with a one year contract while the rest were contracted stuck for five years bill murray represented his snl crew and got into a shoving match with chase as they were pulled apart murray pointed and yelled medium talent ! medium talent live from new york book that may or may not be a fair assessment of chase but it is fair to say that the stars of a mighty wind are extra large talents ! they act ! they sing ! they play instruments ! they create real characters ! they improv ! they re collegiate ive watched this movie many times and it s as good or better than guest s other films the tone is more muted more realistic and so you become more involved in the characters it s an easygoing relaxed film except when bam ! fred willard cuts in as the hyper former child star and starts shouting catchphrases from his sit com glory days ! you will remember them for life ! mitch mickey are awesome and the new main street singers get me highhhhhgggh hihihi but my faves are the folksmen ! their history is fascinating someone should write a book about them ! until then here s what i know in the folksmen distinguished themselves as the only folk group that never wandered with the classic never did no wanderin all the other groups did wandering but the folksmen steadfastly refused my creative license section to follow for more facts truth skip to last paragraph this non wanderin didn t go over well with the folk community in folk purists were further outraged when the folksmen allowed never did no wanderin to be used by the white house in the national campaign against wandering the song opened for this famous commercial fade in with the folksmen song three young teens are leaving an asphalt bike path and start to walk on an unkempt dirt path that follows a wild creek johnny marc skippy price is hesitant to walk away from the paved path and into the wild beatnik c mon johnny don t you want to wander johnny but what are your goals beatnik we don t have no goals right now dig johnny b bbut what is the purpose haven t you done a cost benefit analysis beatnik eerily we re just wanderin man just bloooowin in the wind beatnik don t you wanna just wander man johnny resisting no ! i ve got to stay busy ! and goal oriented peter graves when someone asks you to wander just say no nancy reagan and say it crisply ! don t half ss it that commercial is not on the dvd special features but the special features are packed and rival the main movie in entertainment value the deleted scenes are as good as the ones in the film including a press conference where mitch and the folksmen describe rap music a second cousin to folk with the melody removed and profanity added and describe a concert where someone threw a dog on stage ozzy fan in the folk world plus the full concert footage all recorded live and much much more ! buy it and put it on the shelf with the movies you ve seen ten times 
a great ballet in a brilliant new light hold on to your lids kids a traditional swan lake this is not matthew bourne probably britain s greatest younger choreographer has reset the old and great ballet into a tale of british royal satire repressed sexuality and just plain human longing for comfort and protection and if you ve heard about this version it is definitely not all male there are plenty of female dancers around the swan queen however is now the swan king the corps de ballet who form the swan king s court traditionally delicate swan maidens in white tutus are now bare chested muscular male swans with mean dark shadowed eyes twitching heads and hair combed to a dark point down their foreheads they wear something like feathered leggings from waist to knee the traditional swan lake story has the young prince encountering an enchanted princess human by night a swan by day who can only have the spell broken by true love the prince swears his devotion but is tricked by the sorcerer into thinking another is the swan queen he realizes his mistake but it s too late he rushes to the lake finds the swan queen and joins her in death but reunited in love in bourne s version it is britain in the fifties we meet the young prince as a fearful child dominated by his unfeeling mother the queen and manipulated by the queen s evil press secretary the lonely boy finds comfort only by imagining a brave swan who will protect him and look over him ten years later the prince still is dominated by his mother who has scarcely aged he thinks he loves a young woman who is considered unsuitable by the queen she announces she will hold a ball and introduce him to proper candidates eventually in a drunken repressed rage he finds himself on the shores of a park lake as in a dream he encounters the swan king and the king s court of male swans the ball is held but the press secretary introduces the queen to his own son who looks just like the swan king the queen announces she will marry him the prince strikes his mother he is confined and apparently operated on in a delirium he encounters the real swan king again who protects him from the male swans who have appeared around his bed the end of the ballet has the prince dead on the floor the swan king stands high above the bed holding in his arms the body of the prince as a child the two great dance set pieces are the divertissement of the second act where the prince meets the swan king and the male swans and the queen s ball where all the manipulations and angst come to a head if nothing else the divertissement is worth the price of the disc this is choreography and dance of the highest order tchaikovsky s music so well known and so great has never seemed fresher at times playing against political satire at other times playing against a completely revisionist view of what a corps de ballet should be the lush romantic music turns out to be a wonderful counterpoint to bourne s muscular choreography while one can argue i would that the ballet is as much about the prince s repressed sexuality as it is his loneliness this aspect is understated the ballet is full of prostitutes paparazzi sailors and princesses on the make the queen bears a resemblance perhaps unintentional to a joan collins like woman who keeps boy toys amongst her palace guard the palace ball reeks of casual corrupt omni sexualityadam cooper dances the swan king he s a handsome tough looking guy who carries off the part with style scott ambler dances the prince and is just as good the dvd s picture and audio are first rate there is an informative insert which includes an interview with matthew bourne i recommend this disc highly for those who like ballet tchaikovsky great choreography and great dancing and who might appreciate a startling new look at things 
i hate football i love this movie not to bemoan the people of small town america but i m glad i had the good fortune to grow up in a big city seeing the insane obession of people who live there lives for high school football is hilarous ! if you love football and are from a small town you ll root through the whole film if you don t live in a small town and don t care for football you ll chuckle through most of it i recommend watching hands on a hard body after seeing this another great doc 
fantastic me and my godchild love it i remember reading babar as a child and now i love watching the movie as an adult there is the most wonderful fun song in this movie possibly titled quoti can take good care of me quot i can t get the song out of my head the artwork looks just like the book which is neat in a historical sense the story values family friends and community there are a couple of scenes some children may find disturbing including babar s mother s death a fire where someone is in danger a baby almost being eaten by a crocodile and a nightmare with witches and spooky creatures my godchild who is only two was not bothered by it though i know some children may be i definetly recommend it i think they have a good price on it too 
great thing recommend for all who is the fan of transformers great thing recommend for all who is the fan of transformer 
classic movie nick meyer did a great job at his first directorial debut for the star trek franchise i liked the much more navy ish feel and the more military style with clear cut ranks and the like that is one reason i think that has attracted people to this movie the effects used in the movie were good for the budget and ilm did good for what little money they were given i think they were were also working on jedi at the time as well which has more budget for effects definetly get this for your collection 
the mighty ducks is pretty mighty on my list of top movies it s emilio at his best forget about the breakfast club and young guns this movie it the bees nees it has get family laughs i m happy they did not includ the side plot in which one of the boys gets molesteed by there old coach so go get it and have some fun 
most interesting pre code examination of marital infidelity with an oscar winning norma shearer these early thirties films labelled as pre code are always most interesting to watch from a historical perspective as only a few years after this film was made such a topic would never have been able to be presented as it is here the passage of time of course makes the subject matter of mgm s the divorcee seem tame however back in this story was considered very adult and almost ahead of its time in its fairly honest examination of the expected roles for husbands and wives in the marital situation norma shearer who today is sadly not well known really proved her acting chops in this vehicle and went home with the best actress oscar that year for her troubles often labelled quite restrictively as the dignified first lady of mgm resulting from much of her later work in this decade in husband irving thalberg s prestige productions here proves what she was capable of doing on screen when given meaty roles to tackle her other effort from this time a free soul makes a nice companion piece to the divorcee in illustrating the range of roles shearer was capable of handling when examining her overall career 
adorable and fun this is such an adorable and fun piece of literature austen s language is filled with eloquent and ironic humor following the life of emma woodhouse and her failing matchmaking schemes ultimately culminating in her ignorance of her own true love this is a very easy going and fun read filled with austen s clever charm and smooth tone of voice highly recommended ! 
moore s best film before he became a political celebrity i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs and you re infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again they come up with this idiotic scheme which ended up in disaster both the hilton and auto world closed within a year moore in recent years has become a political celebrity in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it s not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them aren t really interested in changing anything as it might interfere with their livelihoods i don t know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent darkly funny film about real class warfare and the dismantling of the working class in america 
a misunderstood masterpiece not that many movies have been more loved or hated in the history of motion pictures considered a lesser effort and a misfire in david lean s career it still stands the test of time and in my opinion is one of the best films ever made the scope of the story goes from minimalist in depicting the characters to grandiose in the way lawrence of arabia or the bridge over the river kwai was it is a long movie but the story flows and it brings ireland to life in a way not seen since the quiet man cinematography and music are as usual the best you can find and the actors severely criticized over the years make some of their best performances including robert mitchum believed by many to be miscast for the part john mills portrayal of the village idiot rightly brought him and academy award and if we don t compare sarah miles to julie christie she stands on her own let david lean take your hand and take you to ireland you will be glad you did 
xanadu dvd the dvd was received in a very secured package delivery was prompt and on time watching this movie provided a welcomed environment 
an intense and colourful ritual anyone with an interest in underground film or occultism especially thelema should check this film out of course as a quotcrowleyitequot ken s film is very rich and extreme and he combines some striking imagery with some beautiful music i have no idea what the music is that he uses but he manages to relate the on screen imagery to it perfectly i have seen two versions of the film with different soundtracks one of them had a soundtrack consisting of old pop tunes and i found this version to be not as good anyways check it out 
brings old west back to life mario van peebles posse brought a new perspective about the west this was the first western in many years to feature a predominately african american cast stephen baldwin was great in his potrayal of lil jay very educational movie 
to gillian on her th birthday an easy to watch drama with some comedy that is sweet but thankfully not the over the top sweet these kinds of movies often become it s a simple engaging story that is very easy to relate to since the movie tackled subjects like loneliness moving on and connections in an amusing and ultimately heartwarming way peter gallagher stars as david who after years of his wife s death gillian played by the gorgeous michelle pfeiffer due to a boating accident still cannot seem to accept the fact that she s gone in fact when no one is watching he still interacts with her dead wife like she was still alive that causes a conflict with his daughter who was having a hard time dealing with her mom s death because her father doesn t seem to acknowledge that her wife is already dead kathy baker played gillian s sister who wants to take her daughter since she doesn t think that david was capable of raising his daughter peter gallagher gave a great performance he gets to butcher the song you make me feel like dancing compete with a nine year old in building a sand castle contest and he gets to play the heartbroken man who was so in love with his wife he doesn t want to let go it was a great part for him claire danes once again showed her sensitivity as an actress as she realistically portrayed the aches of her character michelle pfeiffer in a semi cameo role was luminous in the few scenes she was in she lights up the screen like a goddess towards the end of the movie the supposedly rational kathy baker and bruce altman after giving lectures on practicality responsibility etc and how talking to your dead wife is silly were both secretly jealous that they don t have that kind of passion for each other its those kinds of moment that elevate this film into just another romance movie grade b 
how fun was the s fun movie some of the bits run a little long but overall entertaining 
a lost gem from carpenter john carpenter s in the mouth of madness is one of his older films and many people have never heard of it too bad really since this is one of his better movies once the slimy monsters show up i think it lost a little bit of it s effect but other than that its pretty solid the movie opens in an asylum where a man is being thrown into a padded room as he insists that he s not insane minutes later a man shows up and tells the insane man that he s here to get him out he doesn t believe the insane man is insane either then the movie flashes back so we can see how the insane man wound up there sam neill jurassic park plays john trent an insurance claims investigator who is quite good at his job while sitting at a diner an axe wielding man asks him do you read sutter cane right as he tries to kill him sutter cane is a world renowned horror author who sells billions of books and is more popular than stephen king problem is his books affect many people drive them to do insane things trent is hired by cane s publishers to track him down but trent doesn t believe it after buying some of cane s books he discovers a map hidden in the covers that leads to a town no one knows about called hobbs end with cane s editor styles in tow trent sets out to the mysterious town when he gets there he ll wind up straddling a fine line between fiction and reality the movie is actually pretty smart as i said they should ve ditched the slimy monsters but the movie it should have ditched the giant spider everything that happens technically makes sense there are no plot holes or anything neill turns in a surprisingly strong performance this movie isn t as creepy as say halloween but it s entertaining if you like john carpenter then you should like this movie also look for appearances by a very young anakin skywalker hayden christensen and that kid from transamerica air bud kevin zegers grade a 
scotty doesn t know i love this movie ! i first saw it on hbo in a hotel room in florida during a high school trip and at that time i only saw part of it still i was laughing so much ! we had about people in the hotel room watching it and we had a great time ive seen this movie so many times since then but it never gets old it is so much fun who wouldn t if given the chance chill in europe with your friends having the time of your life sure they all have their problems but in the end they re better people i never thought i would enjoy an obscene comedy so much but eurotrip completely exceeded all of my expectations i don t even care that the ending was completely unbelieveable out there ridiculous it doesn t matter it just made the movie more hilarious and except for the title of my review i haven t even mentioned the catchy awesome song associated with the movie scotty doesn t know definitely check out the soundtrack because after watching this movie you will feel the need to rock out to this song it is great 
why won t you go out with me robert downey plays a smooth talikng problem solver who tries to pick up a good twoshoes teacher who is also a really good luck charm when it comes to playing casinos whose father is in enormous debt who is being bailed out by robert while still trying to pick up molly while being pursued by a scary hitman harvey keitel while being funny the whole time its a good movie people buy it own it love it enjoy 
all i can say is wow i work at a video store and i would see people rent this movie once in a while finally i decided to rent it and with no expectations except that it would probably be wierd watch it on my day off what i watched was one of the best movies i have ever seen it is a perfect mix of a fairy tale and a nightmare a dream cocktail if you will incredible cinematography and equally great acting i can t believe that i being the movie geek that i am hadn t seen this already i am sure glad i did though i highly recommend you do the same 
nearly dark this is one of my all time faves i own it already but need another copy in case something should happen to mine i first saw this movie years ago and had to have it the lines that the cast uses are hilarious altho it wasn t meant as a comedy it has it s moments all in all my fave bill paxton flick 
the sun has been rising from the east since the beginning of time there are very nice allegories in this movie daniel as the physicist that he is lacking essential social abilities needs to be enlightened more like our average i do my job dont care about the rest modern day type everbody has his her own inner journey isa jesus daniel the old tastement scientist melek angel and juli july throughout the trip to istanbul from hamburg and yes follow the sun as it has been proven to work already a very good humane point of view that we have forgotten for some decades due to unjustified arrogance as he himself fatih akin the director of the movie and writer of the scenario emphasizes in a somewhat joking way and it is most probably true that if sheakespeare were to live today he probably would do such work if you think you are up for some good romance and commedy go for it i would recommend this as a dvd for a romantic date too 
the ultimate wow movie this movie is a non stop adventure in how did he do that and can he top this while movies like crouching tiger and heroe were as notable for their special effects as the stunts legend of drunken master shows that physical grace athletic prowess and yes guts can create an eye popping experience for modern movie goers this movie builds on one great set piece after another but when chan s character really starts drinking watch out ! the last fight scene in the factory will have you rewinding and laughing in delight its that good highly recommended 
ridiculous ! completely ridiculous ok this film bombed at the theaters and i am guessing it was panned by the critics however it has some of the funniest lines and scenes in movie history artie and norm work beautifully together moreoevr there is one scene in this movie that makes me literally cry because it is so funny no change that because it is so ridiculous 
dvd in january this great film will finally be available on dvd on january st 
the undefeated i enjoyed this movie a great group of actor s a little taste of history and beautiful country scenes through out it takes you there

great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch 
do buy this movie don t drink the water is hysterical ! i am a huge woody allen fan and have seen nearly all of his movies there are some movies by woody that even i m not that fond of but this is not one of them this movie is entertaining and well cast there is a lot going on and everytime i watch it i find something different that gets me going ! buy this movie and keep an eye on the subtleties you won t be disappointed 
the original long before jim carey starred in the remake george segal and jane fonda played the roles dick and jane have an ideal life until dick loses his job as dick s quest for a suitable new job drags on the two must start to face the facts of just how bad their financial situation is their lawn has been repossessed and other creditors are banging on their door but things change for the better when they are in a loan office that gets robbed jane pockets some of the stolen money suddenly dick and jane know how they can get more it takes a while to get started but finally their criminal career begins and money is flowing in things are looking good but then one of their jobs goes a little wrong and they have to abandon their take in order to escape the close call makes then give up their new criminal ways but only for a bit the opportunity rises to get back at dick s boss and score a huge take a little planning some training and the new game is afoot of course there are complications but dick and jane manage to rise to the occasion as the tag line states they lost everything and now they are stealing it back i had forgotten much of this film since i saw it decades ago i was surprised to see how close the remake was to this original ie the repossessed lawn and immigration trouble but like with the thomas crown affair the original had a grittier ending there is some harsh language but no nudity although fonda does use the toilet while talking to segal segal and fonda are delightful to watch as they go through their various disguises segal may not be as clownish as carey but he carries the role very well and fonda comes across as a much more competent jane despite being a homemaker to tea leoni s office worker strong acting and good comedy make this just as good as the remake although less wacky check it out 
a dose of the aids plague this was a wonderful movie about a group of very good friends the acting is realistic for the movies sake it will definately pull at your heartstrings also full of the comapassion one hopes for in their end days years i was a caregiver so this was an important view highly recommended 
bad movies don t get any better than this phil tucker s magnum opus robot monster ranks among the best bad movies ever made the plot is incoherent the acting ranges from bad to awful and the eponymous robot monster is a guy in a gorilla suit with a tin foil covered diving helmet who communicates with his home planet using a bubble machine originally released in d this dvd uses a good d print and the transfer is pretty good this is a must have for fans of bad movies 
a fasinating movie a beautiful movie shot before the jesus statue was built on the top of that mountain death followed the heroine all around such a sad but very romantic story turned out to be in the end great cinematography beautiful original songs poor but beautiful brazilians young or old watching this movie and compared it to the city of god the world seemed to become worse and less hope after half a century what a shame 
i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
strangers on a train i m not a real hitchcock fan but this movie by far is my favorite of anything he s done the story line suspense and drama is absolutely first rate if you want to try a hitchcock film this one is it 
treasurehouse a haunting film superbly directed edited and acted a source for cinema techniques we take for granted today in short everything that the remake was not for the film enthusiast an absolutely must have for those to whom movies are simply entertainments probably something of a disappointment open ended as it is and subject to questions to which there is no definite answer 
reveals the complexity of wants and needs not a typical no brainer movie this movie presents complex people with complex motives topher grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways he is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life this lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife he focuses on his job even though he isn t passionate about the work quaid does not like his demotion yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and doesn t try to sabatoge him this is where the film differs from other inferior movies he is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it he even tries to help his new boss the love story is played with honesty since quaid s daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone yet she s attracted to her dad s new boss don t expect cheap laughs and simple answers 
another good csi ny though csi ny is most least favorite of the three csis they still manage to make a good one sometimes this is one of those good ones 
one of my favorite films there were reviews of aguirre at the time i wrote this one here is mine werner herzog presents a minimalist and completely awe inspiring film of a pizarro like adventurer and their disasteroustrip down the amazon shot on location at a fog shrouded machu picchu one sees only the jungle and the exposure in the begining as the party lead by aguirre decends into the jungle below they are soon swallowed and slowly die from everything including the river to the indians the film is completely raw and the locations props and indians completely real the etheral film score carries it along like a dream klaus kinski is perfect as the beligerent and foolish leader of the small party 
colour inferno is a kind of eye candy the colour create a special tone for this imagination story 
definitive version of the classic this version is of all the filmed productions the very best one of this classic story it goes way beyond chapter in emily bronte s novel catherines death and follows the tragic but hopeful relationship which develops between catherine s daughter cathy and hareton heathclife s only natural son they almost become a tragic replay of their parent s live s but fortunatly love alters their course in the end 
nice soap opera i liked the mini series acting is good scenery lovely costuming is superb gives the viewer a real feel for the place and time unfortunately there are some things i don t care for both sides if there s a character in one family there is another in the other just like that person some of the relationships are somewhat stale the main villein is really two dimensional both the southern main character and his northern counterpart fall in love with women socially unacceptable to their society the northerner falls in love with and marries an irish catholic lass the southerner falls in love with a girl who turns out to be the daughter of a harlot and an octeroon one african great grandparent i would have prefurred something more open since history reveals there were quite a few gentle relationships between southern white men and women of african decent which would spare the audience this soap opera stuff great scenerey wonderful scenes wonderful authentic costuming just pathetic as sopa operas are 
a modern day film noir this is an interesting film with a lot of very artistic shots for instance one scene a killer falls down dead and lands face to face with someone tied up on the floor which makes for some eerie and yet comical artistic filmography and how about that melonie diaz wow melonie is one hot little babe prancing around in her catholic schoolgirl pleated short skirt owning the film is worth it just to watch her what eye candy and what legs anyhow the leading man is our comical hero and this film is almost a comedy a humorous look at crime a future classic and should appeal to those who do not like commercial films and like art jazz and the finer things in life 
the batman superman movie is really good the batman superman movie is really good ! batman bruce wane comes to metropolis to make a business deal with lex luthor bruce wayne is also in metropolis becuase he wants to date lois lane this story creates tension between bruce wayne clark kent and lois lane meanwhile the joker and harley quinn are free and they make deal with lex luthor to get rid of superman ! this is great animated movie ! bruce timm did a good job with the story and characters ! highly recommended ! 
jason mother is talking to you this is my nd favorite movie of all time next to from dusk till dawn i dont know why but the cop who gets the claw hammer in the head sticks with me the scene where the cripple takes the machete in the face is friggin harsh jason is the best killer ever 
surprisingly good i thought that supernatural would just be another sci fi thriller but then i started watching it and was surprised to discover that there is real plot line and character development i think this show is wonderful and would recommend it to everyone 
great children s book it s a lovely story about horton the elephant who saves a tiny planet that lives in a speck of dust very cute story 
one remarkable film after watching this last night it s a shame that not more people have seen this movie judging by the amount of reviews and ratings now that director yimou zhang hero house of flying daggers has become more popular i m hoping this will change huozhe or to live takes us on a trip in china that will last us from the s through the s through that time we will see life through eyes fugui and jiazhen a husband and wife with children as well as fugui s mother others here have called it a chinese gone with the wind but in this respect it s more like a chinese les misrables albeit on a smaller scale what s most remarkable about it is how it manages to be both a political film and an objective one it judges the political happenings that serve as its backdrop yes but we never get the sense that it is pre judging them huozhe is no propaganda film it allows its events to unfold organically and allows us to infer its meaning on our own not once is this movie boring effectively placing us there with the family the acting seems so natural that it feels like you are there traveling with them rather then viewing them through a camera this of course shows the strength of zhang s directing you ge plays fugui a popular actor in china won the award for the cannes film festival li gong is beautiful and portrays her character with such passion it s no wonder she has been nominated nearly a dozen times winning most emotional without being sappy honest historically accurate the film does have a black shroud covering it in times of sadness it s lifted a bit to allow us to see happiness indeed life pull this family together it even has bits of humor in it at times i laughed along with the family as much as i felt their pain little details such paintings in the background that chip away as time goes by shows how much care went into making this film characters that seem unimportant become part of the story later what a wonderful film when i first saw it years ago it not only changed the way i saw foreign movies it also changed the way i see life and people any movie that can do that is one i highly recommend to anyone

when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
the most romantic movie ever somewhere in time is by far the most transcendant romantic movie i have ever seen it is old christopher reeve made it before we knew him as superman jane seymour was his co star reeve had just graduated college when a very old woman approaches with a gift from then on it is breathtaking following a time travel episode that moves the story forward to an unforgetable conclusion which does not really conclude in your memory ! there is also a soundtrack of the movie with the most hauntingly beautiful music i have ever heard i wouldn t be without either you will love this movie and the music 
a must rent hands down the best sci fihorror series on tv today i am completly addicted 
a disturbing classic this is one of the most underrated science fiction films of all time on the surface it s a horror movie about a distasteful subject with a lurid dvd cover but it touches on all kinds of interesting subjects the basic plot is straightforward a conscious machine proteus decides it wants to become incarnate and that the only way to do so is by creating a child through aritificial insemination it s a way out story but it s handled in a convincing manner much of the technology is dated but many of the technological ideas are not one striking feature is the prescience of this movie for example computers aren t just used for number crunching but for just about every kind of household work even acting as a media center providing music on demand there s also an important realisation that has been forgotten in many later science fiction films video evidence from a smart machine is no evidence of anything one of the most fascinating aspects of this story is the way it pre empts rather than follows artificial intelligence research when this movie was released it was still the heyday of classical ai research people were building more and more complex reasoning systems assuring us that any day now these machines would become intelligent and self aware but much of this research eventually died out with the promises unfulfilled or produced other benefits as side effects and today the active area of research is robotics what took place was the realisation that if you want a machine to solve problems in the world then a good approach might be to let go of the classical disembodied rational intelligence approach and instead develop machines that are actually in the real world with ability to sense and interact with it this is exactly the realisation that fictional proteus makes in the movie well before most ai researchers in the real world note the geometrical snakelike robot that proteus builds it s very similar in design to modular robots being built today in fact one of the reasons for interest in modular robots is that they are ideal for assembly by machines yet again this movie does an amazing job of predicting future research and technology like quite a few other science fiction movies eg alien and terminator it has a strange fascination with motherhood it s probably an uncomfortable movie for most people given what artificial insemination actually means but i think the subject is handled tastefully so don t expect the kind of graphic scene that the cover suggests all in all a classic 
stand and deliver this video provides an honest report on the trials of high school students as well as the ability to overcome racial profiling a great resource for teachers whom have cultural diversity in their classroom 
magnificent in every way this is the first lear i ever saw and so it will always be dear to me as it touched me so deeply way back when it was first shown on tv as it still does now when i pop my video in the player i can t imagine any production topping this one as each character is played so thoroughly true and with such amazing skill and clearness of language every student or lover of shakespeare must watch this and is highly recommended to purchase it for repeated viewing throughout your life to me shakespeare s plays are so rich because they can be performed successfully innumerable ways so it is absurd to expect any one performance to encapsulate everything a play can offer you can t do it all in one production however i could easily be satisfied with this one lear without ever seeing another all the actors here even the bit parts play their parts essentially to perfection i suppose my favorites are lear gloucester edgar cordelia and regan but that is not to diminish anyone else my only complaint about the play in general is that it is too difficult to believe that the others excepting perhaps lear himself since he is so old nearsighted half madsenile do not recognize kent for who he is merely because he has shaved his beard and put on ragged clothes but of course if they did or he revealed himself the plot would be ruined and it would become a very different play altogether i say enjoy the magnificent acting the beautiful poetry and insights into human nature and let shakespeare sweep you away you can t help but be moved when lear realizes he has taen too little care of the homeless wretches or when lear is reunited with cordelia and she so tenderly speaks to him or alas when lear is overcome with grief as he carries the dead cordelia onto the battlefield and desperately tries to will her back to life before succumbing himself one final note the violence of the play though horrible to contemplate is presented in such a way as to be believable but also watchable not for small children of course obviously they couldn t be too real about it or someone would really get hurt 
awesome this film captures the art of courage and self esteem and that we all have a purpose in life despite the we way we were born herw we have a little guy feet tall with the ehart of a lion and i also concur with the statement that when god made him it was for a reason please watch the film to find out the reason 
it came from outer space i like the story line of this movie but most of all i remember watching it when i was a kid of seven it was scary back then even with limited special effects and no graphic details watching it now was very enjoyable i found myself going back in time this film is in its own right a science fiction classic 
a must if you enjoyed hartman s comedy after all this is very simple you should have this if phil hartman made you laugh yes some reviewers are correct this dvd could be better maybe there are missing funnier sketches maybe the finale is too romantic maybe thats why it gets a star rating from me but still this will make you laugh and remember good old phil among others you will find him impersonating bill clinton frank sinatra phil donahue alm stockdale donald trump jesus barbara bush frankenstein ronald reagan and ed mcmahon he also appears as the unfrozen caveman lawyer a russian weightlifter the anal retentive chef and other funny characters again if you were a hartman fan and miss him get this it might not be perfect but it s good enough hopefully they will make a second dvd with more sketches 
an old favorite it s a shame they havent brought this out on dvd yet its an old pastime thing i remember watching as a kid aint seen it in years and been wanting i 
great action pack movie the movie has a good story to it it s action pack from begining to end i like all the people that play in it this is one of those movies you are sure to enjoy the whole way though the punisher is worth the buy

excellent movie traders ok others to fully apreciate this movie you have to be a trader a trader who has experienced loses many of the emotions that nick goes through are similar to the emotions that most people experience when they begin to trade while nick s trading style is different than most people s price arbitrage and huge amounts of equity the emotions are still there fear and greed

probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
awesome movie this movie is a wonderful follow up to the first anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time i highly recommend this movie to anyone 
something fresh and new for today s kids my children are pretty jaded when it comes to movies they ve been raised on big budget high tech computer generated films like shrek and the incredibles when i purchased this movie it was for me as i love old films and this one intrigued me i put the movie in last night and my kids and i were immediately drawn into the plot the characters the language it is dr suess and the great imaginative sets we all loved it my girls couldn t get enough of the the synchronized skating siamese twins connected by a shared beard i enjoyed studying the sets as so many reminded me of this great children s illustrater and his legendary work cat in the hat

stayin alive the triumph of director zhang yimou s epic film is how deeply he makes us care about ordinary people buffeted by history and struggling to surmount their own frailty fugui a great performance by ge you starts out as a weak spoiled young man addicted to the roll of the dice after losing his house wife jiazhen a sensitive turn by gong li and child fugui emerges from his self inflicted purgatory vowing to stand by his family he hits the road to make money as a puppet master only to get gang pressed into the kaomintang and later into mao s communist army released after the civil war he heads home desperate to slip quietly in to daily life under the new communist order history has a way of imposing itself on people living in ideological societies this film is so effective because zhang makes his political points through the particularity of what happens to fugui and his family fugui and jiazhen s young son bears the brunt of the senseless sacrifices demanded by mao s great leap forward what happens to their daughter and her husband brings home the inmates runningtheasylum feel of the cultural revolution like zhang s not one less this film is subversive precisely because it doesn t club you with its social messages you watch you feel and you draw your own conclusions about how the communist rulers are meeting the needs of the chinese people to live covers a broad swath of time from the s to the s the story unfolds with a seemingly effortless flow that reveals zhang s true artistry the compositions whether it s a landlord s palace or a peasant s alley are perfectly staged every actor s gesture serves the larger plot the pacing propels you through the story but pauses just long enough to let you absorb the big emotional moments this isn t just a great chinese film but a great film by the standards of world cinema and should not be missed 
sound and picture quality is awful buyers beware i don t want to discuss about the movie but the quality of the dvd was awfull sound and picture both picture quality was like that screener bootleg movies criterion group unfortunately didn t do any restoration in this matter ! and there is no special featues either only movie perhaps direct from the original negavie and an english subtitle that s all 
very beautiful movie was very moved by this movie amazing actors and beautiful script simply marvellous you wont regret seeing this awesome movie 
an enduring classis we found tin men to be visually lush with beautifully photographed cadillac fins subtly amusing dialogue and scenes that flowed naturally it could be viewed just to hear the music which was wonderful the interesting story line even had heart without being maudlin it will always be one of our favourites 
for a lost soldier i must say that i really enjoyed the movie and all there could have been a little more nudity but other wise a great movie have watched it several times now and still feel that i am happy with what i saw on the dvd 
a near perfect movie in america is a near perfect movie dealing w grief and learning to live again after tragedy it is also about hope the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks besides a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child s camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see if for nothing else than the performances of mateo and young kristie just amazing 
love the workout this is the best workout i ve been able to get on video ! i ve had this video for a over a year now and i always fall back on it you get a great cardio workout plus muscle toning a great combo to burn the fat i really enjoy denise s video because you see results and she keeps the exercises interesting but not too complicated to follow and boy does it get the heart rate up ! i also really enjoy the yoga influenced cool down stretch it s a nice way to cool down after working so hard 
indeed very very good stuff i have been a fan of the shall we say loud stuff for quite some time everybody gets a turn at bat in the s it was the saints the nils the buzzcocks ramonespistolsclashhandsome dick manatoba and the gang the whole hybrid thrash politicalsex starved straight edge bad brains black flag husker du minor threat gbhfearcircle jerks anti system misfitsscream and so on i love the film because it had heart and it had an insight on its own implosion i happen to like a lot of the bands that were on this tape i am from ny btw the posies needed to be grouped in there because they played with and are friends with nirvana which brings me to my next comment if you don t like the sound finebut when you are happy because someone is dead you are a messed up person if you like the hollies good for you i like their stuff as well but to wish death upon someone because you think the movie sucks is absolute rubbish these bands kick ass on their own terms and did not ask to be filmed i for one am happy they were 
when the past becomes the future a unique library of old and modern photographs are put under threat when the building they are housed in is suddenly sold the new owner of the property liam cunningham played by the able christopher anderson has no interest in the photos and doesn t care what happens to them in fact most of the photos will be destroyed with the crme de la crme of the collection being sold on all liam is interested in is renovating the building and making a hefty profit for the business he represents however the library s many eccentric employees won t give up without a fight and from then on a war of wits and determination is played out among a wonderful array of black and white photographs that represent the past the present and even the future the characters in this film are truly delightful especially timothy spall who plays the oddball oswald bates a man with a memory for faces so attuned that he can see resemblances between a person he has only seen once and those whose pictures are imprinted upon photographic paper however the battle to save the collection seems doomed with every attempt the library staff makes being thwarted but fate has something wonderful in store for liam cunningham and it is this wonderful twist in the story that ultimately will save the collection for future generations this is a fabulous film originally a three part series for the bbc in the late s i think it would have been a success if it had been released in art house cinemas all over the world a final pointer watch and listen out for the superb lindsay duncan who plays the diminutive marilyn truman the head librarian in the story she has the most amazing voice and when telling liam cunningham stories around certain photographs she captivates her audience to the point that you think that you are in the same room as her and liam a good musical score a sound cast wonderful photography and camera work shooting the past is a classic of a film that stephen poliakoff has every reason to be proud off look out for poliakoff s other masterpiece the lost prince both are worth having in your dvd video collection 
comment on movie empire of the sun i think we already did this this is a classic historically based movie educational in that i and probably many others didnt know about the english colony in a special status in china prior to pearl harbor the cars were beautiful i mistakenly thought the packard was a rolls ! beautiful antigueaircraft scale model fighters good flying scenes theme music welch hymn i think helped so much too the horrors of war are clearly shown but without a deliberate antiwar theme thatcan detract from good drama all told a must have dvd richard and arlene norman born in both of us observed wwii in real time via newsreels life magazineradio lowell thomas and the narratives of the combatants we knew

beautiful and bold beautiful beautiful ! who doesn t want to dance majestically like this beautiful lady she is captivating from beginning to end learn the beautiful gypsy tango ! hips swaying skirt flying beautiful hand movement from posture to skirt basic technique arm and body placement to hand finger wrist movement very well broken down and easily explained combinations guide you into a beautiful gypsy tango learn turns skirt technique intricate footwork the farruca with combinations the most interesting for me was the flat point heel try it with speed for a challenge this is bold heavy footwork with aggressive combinations live performances by puela lunaris who beautifully executes the gypsy tango and farruca two dances of spain although i am a belly dancer overall i feel this program has brought more grace and elegance into my personal style dance being so universal marries the common ground in gypsy tango that i devote to my dance to create my own special blend this was a good learning experience bringing variety and versatility for my audience 
cutting edge definately one of the best skating love stories ever it s humerous and both actors play their parts so well 
i remember ma ma this movie is one of the most educational films for kids of today to watch it shows kids how they should look up to their elders and learn from them so many kids today are not taught about their familys past and how their grandparents and great great grandparents worked and play just to survive without their grandparents they would not be here 
like others wrote this is the best hip hopwith break dancing as a main point krush groove is the best for just the music side movie ever ! real rappers real break dancers both mixed in with actors who probably did not know any rap music at all it is an authentic dipitcion of the hip hop world at that time breakin is a hollywood beat street knockoff but good in it s own right i won t go into the story but i see that they did not put surround sound on this one yet another interesting note i own the original one that came out on dvd some years ago that cover had rae dawn chong on the cover i assume because she was the biggest star and at the time they did not think hip hop would sell now as you can see they make sure that hip hop is the main focal point for trying to sell it this time around 
return to easter beagle go back in time to when you were younger and watched snoopy on television it s just that great to see the charlie brown gang waiting and preparing for the arrival of the easter beagle and now i can share that experience with my grandchildren thank you easter beagle happy easter 
his best flick i ve never been a big van damme fan but i have to admit this movie is fun it s another retelling of kurasawa s classic yojimbo much like a fist full of dollars clint eastwood and last man standing bruce willis this however is like the trailer park version it s a little less classy and has nowhere near the same caliber acting what it does have is mr miyagi danny trejo and a couple other surprise faces van damme even comes across with a hint of self depreciating humor probably unintentional that sets this flick apart from the rest of his stuff nobody takes van damme seriously he should make more movies like this with ensemble cast and maybe his career would turn around 
view and read the book as well i saw the movie before i read riefenstahls autobiography when i watched the movie i was sure it had been staged nothing could be that perfect just filmed during events then i read riefenstahl s autobiography and was awed she describes in detail what she experienced and endured to make this film nothing was staged her enemies tried to prevent her from making it but she persevered it is a superb documentary of a very anguished time in world history 
watching the master at work henryk szeryng undeservedly less famous these days than perlman or zukerman was for more than years from the late s to the early s among the world s greatest violin players together with heifetz milstein oistrakh and later perlman his special talents were the most perfect intonation pitch in all of recorded violin playing a miraculously huge radiant almost organ like tone and a pronounced ability to convey the overall architecture of a piece szeryng s bow arm stronger and better controlled than anyone else s was and is the stuff of legends this video lets us witness the master in his prime the sound is not very good to get a real sense of szeryng s sound buy a cd of one of the many violin concertos he recorded in the s and the camera does some annoying things but overall it s a wonderful opportunity to watch how he kneads a tone how his ridiculously muscular and flexible fingers seem to come alive on the fingerboard how he like a great opera singer carefully develops a long melody from a soft beginning to spectacular ringing heights how intelligently he interacts with the orchestral accompaniment the second movement of the tchaikovsky particularly is out of this world in its combination of soaring melody and darkest passion and pathos for anyone interested in the violin and its capabilities this is an indispensable document 
a forgotten and overlooked dramatic gem i picked up a prayer for the dying on a whime one day i have always liked mickey rourke and i think he is one of the most underrated actors int he business i never heard of this film before and bought it and not knowing how good it would be upon viewing the film i couldn t help thinking how much better this movie could have been mickey rourke gives an absolutly moving performance as a hit man wanting to give up his evil ways i know that that has been used as a plot for a hundred movies but this is easily one of the better of those films some people bob hoskins as miscast int he role of the priest but i found him to also give a good performance overall i was very moved by the film i only wish it went a little more in depth with bob hoskins character it gives hints that he and mickey rourke s character are much alike but doesn t go into real depth i have also heard that mickey rourke was upset with the final result of the film though it could have been much better it still comes off as a very good dramatic piece of cinema this film is a great way to spend a saturday afternoon 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography 
classic cosby this is just classic cosby stand up i think he has done better stuff but this is a good dvd 
a terrific b film noir no one smokes in it and there is very little rain on the night streets but a fox release called i wake up screaming is definitely a film noir and a very good one working with a dwight taylor screenplay director bruce humberstone who directed four charlie chan films at fox has a terrific noir cast atypically cast betty grable is jill lynn her fashion model sister vicki carole landis is found murdered leading the suspects is sports promoter frankie christopher victor mature along with oily detective ed cornell laird cregar and hotel desk clerk elisha cook jr there is also a gossip columnist alan mowbray maybe jill herself is the killer in an act of jealousy possibly jill and frankie did the crime together i wake up screaming has wonderfully atmospheric new york city locales the movie has beautiful b w photography by edward cronjager who worked in technicolor with ernst lubitsch a couple of years later on heaven can wait and it has very suspenseful plotting with the classic noir flashback device vicki s body is discovered in the opening scenes for most of the movie frankie and jill are being interrogated in two police offices under harsh lights while also being given the third degree by the pesty cornell all over manhattan the ending is a real surprise or was to me i wake up screaming also makes beautiful use of over the rainbow borrowed from mgm and the classic fox street scene theme this is an minute b movie and no classic but is still a gripping and rewarding entry in the fox film noir dvd series with an outstanding cast and crew it is certainly worth your time if you like film noir the underrated grable does excellently in a non musical role humberstone had just completed sun valley serenade with her dvd bonuses include an audio commentary by noir expert eddie muller a deleted scene and alternate hot spot opening titles this movie is currently selling for only brand new from amazon so it is probably a better sales item than a rental 
kickboxer goes on without van damme for the better kickboxer the road back deals with david sloan the brother of kurt amp eric sloan david is running his brothers kickboxer school tung po killed off van damme s charcter for the first kickboxer i say good sasha mitchell is a lot better tung po can only regain his honor by fighting david since kurt is dead so david vs tung po with glue and glass is a bloody battle great movie the best in the series 
i don t own many movies but this is a must have my husband and i do not own many movies but this is one we bought right away it is the type of movie that you need to see more than once to absorb all the intricate details if you enjoyed movies like pulp fiction and memento because of the non linear progression of time you will love this film i was skeptical of an aston kutcher movie because of his previous silly comedies like dude where s my car but he is a first rate dramatic actor in this film the infinifilm features are also fun if you enjoy things like deleted scenes and what was the director thinking type explanations love it 
a great film it all started with john malkovich me seeing the movie i mean not the film itself i was scanning through malkovich s filmography and saw this film in their i had heard of the film but had no idea what it was about but i checked it out malkovich is close to top billing but his role is really small having said that this was an amazing film truly a work of art the movie stars sam waterston serial mom playing sydney schanberg a new york times columnist who heads to cambodia on the brink of war bombs have been dropped labor camps have been set up and schanberg wants to write about all of it when he gets there he meets dith pran haing s ngor who won an oscar for the role who becomes his friend and interpreter malkovich plays schanberg s photographer al rockoff his role is brief but he leaves his mark after schanberg s war entraps himself and his fellow journalists pran saves him from being executed but is himself placed in a labor camp the script is based on a new york times article by schanberg called the death and life of dith pran when i saw that i figured this would be a rather depressing story truth is the film is quite uplifting the choice to use john lennon s imagine for the final scene was perfect anyway back to the synopsis schanberg is back in new york while pran slaves at the labor camp schanberg has no idea whether pran is alive or dead but doesn t give up on the idea of one day reuniting with his friend most films that take place in this setting i m not a big fan of i m not saying i didn t like these films but movies like the constant gardener and beyond borders are a bit like this movie although for the record this film is way better having said those last two things i was surprised that i liked this film whether you re a fan of these kinds of movies or not you need to see this it s an important and uplifting movie that no one should not see grade a 
a charming clever british comedy charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly played role as england s king henry the eigth who infamously married six different queens divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty capacious king laughton as ever is a marvel skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly cariacatured lout and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point this is all about the cleverly rendered script which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads and on the classy ensemble acting which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print im writing in the year perhaps criterion or some other class act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon still fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot 
barbarella is the unchallenged queen of the galaxy after watching jane fonda as barbarella i have nothing negative to say about her 
a classic this movie is a great accompaniment to pbs s recent documentary watergate plus years later we watched them back to back as pbs aired them this way as well 
worked wonderfully download takes awhile but the picture quality was great even full screen it played all the way through and to boot it s an excellent show 
love atlantis i think this was a great spin off from stargate sg which was starting to get stale even though i love watching it still love being able to download them all just wish they d get updated quicker honestly when i left weeks ago i saw the last episode available and i ve missed the next 
who knew a honeymoon on wheels could be so funny the long long trailer is the second lucy movie i saw and it s probably my favorite one with a dynamic cast who dosn t love lucy with ricky and a surprisely funny plot you can t help but love this hidden lucy treasure i watch this movie again and again i m only disappointed it hasn t come to dvd tacylucy and nicky desi have it all love but there love is soon tested when they decide to buy a trailer instead of a proper home soon casosis erupts as lucy and nicky have to deal with cramped spaces car problems dozens of nick nacks high mountains pesky relatives trailer brakes and annoying neighbors which eventually lead to martial fueds and a break up will nicky and tacy be able to overcome the trailer who could of guessed a life on four wheels could be so funny this is one of my favorite old movies of all time and more importantly it s funny i still laugh everytime i watch it this is a must for any old comedy movie buff or any lucy or desi fan 
brilliant as a fan of new order and joy division this was on the top of my list fast paced witty and shot in documentary like style hour party people is a great movie along side the more traditional narratives like go all gone pete tong groove etc winderbottom does a terrific job in satisfying a range of audience and steve coogan is terrific the soundtrack is solid and the produciton value is high not to be missed by fans not ultimate fans and general movie goers alike 
conventional but still slyly subversive i caught this movie on television after having avoided it in the theater fearing it would be a conventional mainstream comedy it hooked me immediately and was far more entertaining than i would have expected jack black s scruffy rocker character had a surprisingly deft touch with the schoolkids one that was supportive and positive and fair minded and thus disarmingly sweet and his character was also hilarious i also liked the the portrayal of joan cusack s character as a woman who had been warped by her high pressure stultifying job as a school principal nice underlying theme about rejecting the pressure by society to live up to different types of perfection and instead just rockin out 
riveting and disturbing hearing the and i cannot think of a more appropriate word for it bigoted assertions of the deaf community individuals regarding cochlear implants for their children i was consistently reminded of instances we ve seen wherein some parent would assert i only had a high school education and that has been good enough for me no kid of mine needs to go to college i wish the deaf community well and their thinking requires a tremendous deal of exercise 
psychological thriller this movie did a good job of presenting the trials and tribulations of acceptance i honestly felt bad for the badguys at some points in the movie the drug dealers were like family but their actions weren t commendable by far the money and love provided by the underworlds were quick fixes for the things the main character seemed to be lacking it made me really think how easy it could be to get engulfed in the life of crime if the situation presented itself 
no way out sidney poitier s first movie no way out is one of his best this movie needs to be put out on dvd so everyone can benefit by the format dvd would bring to it the supporting cast is wonderful i highly recommend this movie 
food for brain do you have large appetite i think this ultimate movie is definitely for collection instead of renting it again and again to unlock the mysteries just buy the lock and take your time solving the puzzles and save too it s not a theater movie it s a home couch solitary movie these clues are helpful only if you have watched the whole movie in the beginning the movie zooms into a sleeping woman which means the coming up things are dream dream of diane in dream her name is betty which she would only dream in real life the car accident of rita real life camellia girl friend of diane which was almost similar to that one night in real life of diane when camellia broke her heart breaking up with her and announcing her marriage with a movie director it was no less than a worse accident for diane which she wanted camellia to experience so there is rita only survivor of a bad car wreck in real life camellia is a vamp so diane dreams rita camellia with lost memory that makes rita very innocent and loyal to her the opposite of real life in real life camellia is helping diane getting movie roles but in the dream betty real life diane is helping rita in dream betty is full of life and acting talent but in reality diane is just opposite in reality diane had come from canada to her aunt place where she is living so she dreams about going to her aunt house where she meets rita the director in the dream is the one camellia is going to marry and once in a party diane overheard the director saying i get the pool and you get the pool man which she dreams later she dreams lot bad for the poor director she also dreams that there has been lots of conflict going on between director s and producer s choice to cast the lead actress this shows the competition between diane and camellia in real life camellia is the director choice the hit man is the one she hired to kill camellia the cowboy is still a puzzle he appears times in the movie betty and rita discovering a body of diane is also puzzle the restaurant scene with the scary guy is still a puzzle to me the silencio club part of the movie is a hint for the viewers and gives betty the puzzle box for which she has the key when rita unlocks the blue box the reality starts diane is in horrible condition as she missed camellia she knows that camellia has been murdered because the hit man has returned her the blue key she is so paranoid that she kills herself so basically diane who lost her gf camellia and had her murdered is dreaming a better world till the silencio club part of the movie when she wakes up she realizes her mistake and kills herself 
there has to be more on the way i need to see more voltron they need to come out with a box set or something this was a great video to watch because it brings back so many memories everybody that watched voltron knows what i m talking about if you used to like it then you might as well get this one too 
bleak powerful honest given the recent spate of chest thumping rough butnoblesoldier films complete with overblown stirring scores slo mo hero shots about wwii it s refreshing to return to a truly honest film about that war and about all wars what we have here is the reality tired dirty emotionally shocked men unprepared for the randomness casual cruelties of war ironic that it takes an absurdist tale such as this one complete with time travel aliens to present the indifference of the universe far more accurately than supposedly realistic films but it s so there s no divine historic mission no larger thanlife heroes no ultimate glory honor there s just the destruction of civilization the slaughter of the innocent all in the name of the state or the flag or our god or some other empty platitude like many late s early s war films this one has a stark look to it with all the gloss wiped away revealing the senselessness of war the hollowness of its justifications it doesn t excuse the evils of something like fascism or the necessity of stopping it it simply points out that the good guys tend to become what they re fighting that it destroys their humanity that it swallows human beings whole sucks out their souls war is simply an ugly filthy business and it shouldn t be decked in patriotic ribbons noble sounding phrases the cast is superb here with valerie perrine s soft porn actress montana wildhack a standout full of joy life the antithesis of war tellingly billy pilgrim only seems truly happy content during his time with her rather than in his by thenumbers marriage where the only true affection in his life seems to be his dog ron leibman s psychotic paul lazzaro thats two zs dammit is all too real a wounded self loathing shell driven by his own consuming fear hatred insecurities while eugene roche s kindly but fatally naive trusting edgar derby is both comic tragic at once the transitioning between time periods is cleanly subtly accomplished one memory leading to another as well as suggesting the randomness of the universe itself in short an underrated gem from the golden age of american filmmaking and a welcome antidote to films that pander to the most simplistic worldviews all in all most highly recommended 
dvd is on the way good news mike leigh fans this movie is now scheduled to be released on dvd on september according to amazon ! the movie is an excellent one sometimes unjustly considered one of leigh s lesser works it functions both as comedy and drama as it looks at the reunion of two friends from college several years after they have graduated and have been trying to find their niche in the world told in a series of flashbacks and in present time it shows how he characters have grown over time while many of their vulnerabilities remain a must for any and all mike leigh fans 
decidely nasty insects with funny shoes a nasty disease is ravaging the children of manhattan the only way to combat it anyone can think of it is to eradicate the local cockroach population that is acting as carriers enter insect specialist dr susan tyler mira sorvino who fiddles around with the cockroach gene to produce an aggressive new strain the judas breed that preys on normal cockroaches the idea is that it will die out after one generation as all females judases released are sterile but that doesn t seem to work and three years later something nasty seems to be lurking around the subway system some street kids bring tyler an alarming specimen in an old corn flakes box and chuy an autistic little boy starts to notice people with funny funny shoes its a splendid little horror movie one of the best of the s particularly liable to freak you out if you don t like creepy crawlies the first hour is the best while there is still an air of mystery about these strange bugs and there are some beautifully clever scary scenes such as that where chuy goes exploring or where tyler is groping for a dropped torch it has its faults the last half hour or so once the protagonists know what they are up against where it just turns into a chase movie is rather less effective the opening title sequence is a quite shameless rip off of seen and the story surely doesn t surely make a whole not of biological sense for it to be possible in evolutionary terms a single judas bug generation can t be much more than a few minutes long in which case its hugely implausible that as tyler decides there s only a single fertile male in circulation at a given time killing whom off will solve the problem but not to worry this remains a cracking good scary movie 
tiki fan loves blue hawaii mai tai s the spirit of tiki is alive well in blue hawaii with elvis his best film ! everything seems to work in this film script songs costumes cinematography location location location filmed only two years after statehood hawaii still has that unspolied unoverbuilt vibe look there s hawaiian shirts babes mai tai s a plenty coupled with elvis s charisma he really looked liked he enjoyed doing this film the final wedding scene is a hawaiian kitsch homerun wow ! 
beat street honestly beat street is the best breakin video out there period this like the orgin of hip hop music dancing and grafitti to this day the storyline is alright not going to go into details but it send out a positive message to everyone that was there and even today honestly just buy the movie why read this review ! 
sumptuous lavish and impressive we loved this film foremost it was beautifully filmed with lavish costumes sets scenery the music is beautiful i m disappointed that it s not available i m a fan of movie scores i thoroughly enjoyed the story line also not being familiar with the history of siam thailandburma i can t vouch for its historical accuracy whether correct or not it s a fascinating story my only criticism is that we became slightly confused by the interwoven relationships of the characters i d have liked a guide or family tree to follow so i could keep up with the many hierarchies it was sometimes hard to keep up with who was doing what to whom why if they were related familiarly or only politically although much of this was unfamiliar material i highly recommend it if you enjoy subtitled films we were never bored 
fascinating film great film about human relationships culture tradition and self determination no where near as controversial as one might guess from the bruhaha 
two thumbs up in my opinion this movie is exactly what you would expect it to be sure it is vulgar sure there are a lot of explicits throughout the movie and much drug use but it is what it is scott s charachter is coming to grips with his friends death and looking to fit in and rebel where ever he can it is a dark movie not suited for children but if this is the type of movie that you enjoy and go into it knowing that it is dark vulgar and morbid and that is what you want to see at the moment then you get what you rented no this is not what teens are like nor is tx chainsaw real either the point is just sit back and either enjoy it or hate it but i give it out of stars it is what it is 
way to go amazon ! very cool just got done watching the show and it was awesome of course i had to download the tool how else do you get started once it downloaded it worked very well and the video was right there to watch when i was ready note to self get cable dsl is a slow download but it worked great and the picture quality was awesome no commercials i didn t have any troubles installing it on my computer and the help tool walked me through it 
i know i shouldn t like this but i do yes the movie is juvenile yes the movie has some gross out moments yes the plot is basic but it is still fun ! i know that now that i am in my twenties i am supposed to be more into classical films and literature and modern smart and well written films and literature and i am but i also really like movies like this films like out cold hackers grind etc all have that same magical combination of good times outrageous skills or situations comedy adventure and some deeper meaning ultimately these types of movies speak to the inner child in all of us especially those of us that missed out on some of the light hearted teen years due to some reason or another dont watch this movie to learn anything or to expand your mind watch it to have a good time and get some great laughs 
pate bros nd joint rolled with creeper the cool thing about watching movies constantly is that you see so many bad ones that occasionally a movie as slick as this plays out the cast is top notch as is the directing by the pate brothers whose other credits include quotthe grave quot and the short lived but cool tv show quotgvsequot plenty of twists and turns abound in this movie that centers around roth in one of his best performances taking a lie ditector test from two shady cops rooker and penn to find out if he is a murderer a film that relies on character development and suprises that pays off in the end with something to think about this is a good one it would be nice to see on dvd but is not yet released on that format 
jane eyre i have this original version of jane eyre with orson welles i fell in love with it as a young girl watching it on tv it is truly wonderful i also have the version with william hurt and charlotte gainsburg hauntingly beautiful i recently purchased the newest jane eyre from masterpiece theater this is an updated version with just the most subtle hint of spice also wonderful anyone who loves the jane eyre story should treat themselves to all three versions you won t be dissapointed 
the hunger catherine deneuve i have been looking for this vampire movie for awhile i love this movie and am glad i found it 
a very sweet british film i loved this movie right from the start craig ferguson and brenda blethyn are wonderful together and some of the scenes of little old ladies geting unknowingly giggly on tea are just a hoot i d always liked craig ferguson as mr wick on the the drew carey show and it s nice to see that there is so much more to him than just that character 
very depressing tale the title of this movie holds no secrets the virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic between the acting and a great story line but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions 
a mystery solved vampire enthusiasts who have read strieber s novel had a bit of a surprise when they saw scott s the hunger there were several liberties taken with the film still on many occasions adaptation for screen often includes sacrifices especially for time and budget we accept this there was always something a little off here lets start from the beginning this film is exquisitely shot the framing is simple and beautiful in fact the composition is almost breath taking still frames could appear as individual photographs suitable for display likewise the acting is beyond reproach pitch perfect the costumes unforgettable the glasses alone the soundtrack is lush in fact when i first rented the film in middle school i was inspired to explore classical music today i have an extensive collection and bach cello suites remains my favorite thank you mr scott for such a wonderful gift the tale is both sensual and heart breaking spoiler stop reading now if you have not seen this film interestingly susan sarandon describes the film as a metaphor for addiction in the director s commentary she explains that her character would rather commit suicide than to live with an addiction to blood with an addiction to death to be a conduit of death does that comment sound odd considering how the film concludes here is what happened the film was intended to end with the powerful death of dr sarah roberts it was to be a story of sacrifice but as scott and sarandon reveal the powers that be their words meaning the studio executives demanded the tag at the end you see the studio was hoping for a sequel and obviously more money so the entire message of the film was destroyed not to mention the attention to continuity was left in ruins the bitterness in this commentary is justified by insisting on a nonsensical ending so how did miriam s lovers decompose if she is still alive the film did not achieve the box office success predicted and the sequel was shelved so why grant this film five stars no matter what this film is nearly as engrossing as the first time i saw it it is in my opinion one of the most inventive captivating vampire films ever made and seeing peter murphy made me feel thirteen all over again i think i ll break out some bauhaus right now suggested reading hanson ellis vampires who bite out takes essays on queer theory and film ed ellis hanson durham duke up this essay explores lesbian vampirism in film history with particular attention to draculas daughter vampyres and the hunger 
excellent this film has fascinated me since i was a small child and stil does without fail the music is wonderful also everyone who wants or needs something to boost them up a bit watch this 
van damme at his best love this movie jean claude van damme at his best great fun for all action fans do not miss this one 
the shooter dolph decided he wanted to make the transistion from action hero to well respected movie star so he dedicated himself to acting on broadway in an attempt to relearn his trade this was his first film afterwards and you can notice the change dolph makes the jump from bare chested shenigans to silk suits and his acting stands him at head and shoulders above the rest this film has at all set in the beautiful city of prague it has great scenery action scenes including the traditional groping for a gun while hanging off the edge of a building love scenes dolph manages to turn a lesbian onto men and great cliches buy it you ll love it 
i can t believe i m saying this i usually don t like these sophomoric movies that have thin plots and not much substance american pie scary movie van wilder etc but i found this one funny ! the three main characters played their parts so well and were very funny this is one movie i can watch again and again and still laugh give it a try it might surprise you 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
un box revisited this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i don t see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in mb bites each hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy 
only one question my only question is when can i buy season this is the perfect medium to continue the most enjoyed show that tv execs killed this decade 
old plot but overall great sure it s the same old plot you see in every ski movie some rich developers trying to take away the ski resort from the locals but the characters in this movie are really interesting some parts are really funny and the music is good too i highly recommend this movie if you like snowboarding at all also check out ski school 
a lyric tale of two exiles music is the center of thewlis world and it is the center of the movie you ll appreciate your sound system during this film because it is made up of music rather than dialogue or stunning visuals although thandie newton is certainly a stunning visual this movie stands out because it is so absolutely like no other not even bertolucci s previous efforts prepare you for it thewlis you might remember from naked plays the decadent westerner all bertolucci lead roles are that we are asked to pay attention to thewlis does not demand you pay attention like brando does rather he is so quiet and mysterious you can t help but pay attention only when he plays piano do you find out how much is going on within him and what music the piano is the third major presence in this movie thewliss and newton come from different sides of the world and neither is perhaps very satisfied with the place from whence they come both exiles and each is very curious about the other many times the camera is on one at a time while each wonders about the other in the next room it doesn t sound like much but it is drama of a very peculiar sort two humans two cultures perhaps slowly coming into contact very strange and very powerful movie you may as well order the soundtrack too 
gang tapes i think this is the best movie i have seen in a while if you arelooking for something new to watch this is the movie for you i watched it twice in the same day i believe i may watch it againtonight i fell in love with darris love after his portrayal of the character alonzo 
doctor who and the first download doctor who materialised without his tardis on this my first timelord download in the amazon unbox which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside for a very reasonable sum my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration where he encounters the nestene conciousness the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental a great experience and will not be the last easy to navigate and fun for all the family someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type tardis 
great i haven t heard the original cast recording so i can t compare this to it but i think this is a very good movie musical madonna and antonio banderas did a great job ! the music is really good this musical is not as good as the phantom of the opera but it is hard to be better than phantom you must see evita 
the strong should protect the weak or slaying the judicialbureaucratic goliaths paul newman is great as a despairing alcoholic david once second in his law class once part of a prestigious law firm once married till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner and father inlaw who wanted to fix a jury the above is past history just mentioned in the film it is some years after and alcoholic newman with only cases in the last few years has an epiphany where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens as he gets the picture so to speak of a woman treated unjustly whom he can help he forgets himself and his troubles and the people who have pushed him around and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman against the hospital and doctors who damaged her he will later awaken the conscience as the movie hints of one of the goliaths he goes up against however there are pitfalls as opposing lawyer concannon is not above using any trick or person to destroy the case paul newman s epiphany scene which i won t describe further to spoil it for you but which is clearly recognizable is quite moving his goliaths include the biased hostile judge the prince of darkness superlawyer concannon played well by james mason always good at suave villians the doctors and most of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate deborah ann kaye and the somewhat hesitant bishop brophy head of st catherine s the hospital where mrs kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage set in boston a largely catholic city i am told we here have nominal catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the christian good samaritan story seriously my family caution there are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene the verdict implies the barely seen who also are key players the jury who must deliver the verdict will they go with the letter of the law or its spirit if you are familiar with this phrase from the christian faith you have the answer hint of spoiler below my wish is that brain injured terri schiavo had had a jurywho could see the spirit of the law instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a congress that dared how dare they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude to merely ask for a second look at the whole case meanwhile terri slowly starved to death shame on us ! shades of nazi eugenics 
kinda cute but the traveling plot seemed like a take off of trains planes and automobiles traveling from ny to savannah vs traveling from chicago to ny same sequence airplane delays then train occurrence then bus then jalopy type car but since i totally enjoyed the steve martin movie i also enjoyed forces of nature the writer even threw in some weather and fire same as trains planes and automobiles because of the similarities i rated it four stars instead of five i thought the movie was cute and i like both sandra bullock and ben affleck i saw the movie as being typical of infatuation with a good looking person to whom we ve been thrown together with for a brief unlikely encounter and of indecisiveness prior to the marrage ceremony but ben was indeed committed to his fiance and to his future which was a positive attribute on his behalf unlike some other reviewers who stated commitment was void i felt it was very much stated in this movie in spite of other s around them having their own relationships fall apart sarahs life was to be her son and her relationship with him to build it up after some years of absence the movie ended correctly everyone got what they wanted gail gupton author the day diet of spiritual enlightenment and seekers of truth 
my favorite van damme movie anyone who gave this movie a star rating needs to go find a really high cliff to go jump off of this is actually a pretty decent film with some beautiful shots and cool desert scenery and ok acting from van damme most of the supporting cast play their parts quite well too i believe and seemingly good chemistry between the main characters i mean yeah of course this isn t lawrence of arabia or saving private ryan but then again what else is i can t tell you how many times i ve watched this movie it has some kind of pleasant addicting nature to it that i can t quite describe a great film to watch if you are sick at home or just plain out of your mind bored and also i ll definitely have to give this movie props as being the best movie i ve ever found in the walmart dollar bin even better than the lower budget clint eastwood flicks that i ve found in there it s that good !

brilliant and profound film this french film with subtitles of a play of the th century is excellent it s hard to describe other than it s about love integrity courage not being a yesman in opposition to the trickery murder and bad luck tragedy of this fallen world if one doesn t have courage the other virtues are impossible i watch it regularly with my children and let this beautiful and uplifting film wash over us no teenager should grow up without seeing truly this film and disney s pinocchio i live in ireland and had to buy it in the u s because for some reason the dvd is not available on this side of the pond 
world s finest heroes in after producing at least seasons of batman the animated series and one season of superman the animated series the creative minds behind both tv sensations decided to craft a story focusing on what would happen when the two greatest heroes in the dc universe came together the batman superman movie finds batman voiced by kevin conroy and superman voiced by tim daly having to join forces to thwart a new evil scheme being hatched by the nefarious duo of the joker voiced by mark hamill and lex luthor voiced by clancy brown one problem for superman and batman being able to work together is that they both know the others secret identity and making matters even worse is the fact that bruce wayne has begun a relationship with daily planet reporter lois lane voiced by dana delany and this is just what was needed to make clark kent jealous will these two heroes put aside their differences to save metropolis from the clutches of the joker and lex luthor or succumb to their petty rivalries after a very successful outing with their first animated feature film batman mask of the phantasm and a not as successful yet still entertaining sequel batman mr freeze sub zero both warner brothers and the producers of the two series were leery of jumping into another animated feature film so instead of trying to come up with a story that exists outside of the standard continuity of either series they opted instead to have the movie s storyline take place over the course of episodes within the second season of superman the animated series this way the continuity is left intact for both characters and if the part story arc is successful in terms of ratings then release them all together as a feature length direct tovideo film well obviously since i m reviewing the film it means that the part arc was successful and proved to be very entertaining one nice piece of trivia about the batman animated movies that had been produced thus far including this one is that with batman mask of the phantasm and the batman superman movie the two series creators bruce timm alan burnett and paul dini were producers for those movies and also served as co writers however on batman mr freeze sub zero none of them are credited this piece of trivia may prove to be why the two of the movies were very successful and entertaining on many levels while the latter was somewhat inferior one more thing for fans of these two characters respective animated series and their animated movies you can find the entire episode story arc that comprises this dvd movie in the recently released to dvd second volume of superman the animated series it s up to you whether or not you choose to view the episodes as they originally aired within the season or stand alone as a movie either way they are still great additions to excellent animated series the batman superman movie is unrated and contains violence 
the big one michael moore s crusade against corporate america g d bless you michael moore for your crusades not only in the books you have written but also for your doccumentary movies to safeguard the working man blue collar workers the big one is depressing and funny at the same time his political satire and savy humour helps you deal with the horrible reality of the coruption in government and in corporations in america it is about time someone stood up to the corruption of the ceos and corporations g d gave michael moore the heart and the guts to go out there and fight the good fight not only for faith but also for justice 
nice story even for non jazz fans this is jazz fans delight tons of jazz featuring tenor saxophone with some bebop thrown in most of the music is nice mellow stuff and interesting to hear even to a non jazz buff like me the music and interesting story made me purchase the dvd which i have subsequently watched few a couple of times the story is pretty laid back a simple tale of an american alcoholic sax great playing in france who reforms because of a french fan who cares about him dexter gordon s unique voice makes helps him become an interesting character to hear and the real life jazz great proves to be a decent actor too francois cluzet plays the admirer who goes out of his way to help his idol gabrielle haker is pleasant to watch as cluzet s young daughter she always seems to have a pleasant smile on her face i don t why this film was rated r because there is no sex no nudity little profanity except for several mfs which must be the reason for the rating nevertheless it s a pretty tame movie even though the story is a bit slow and would probably bore the heck out of most young people today i found it entertaining and definitely different it s just a nice gentle story whether you are a fan of jazz or not 
deserves far more than stars i ve been looking for a dvd like this one for years ! i ve been dancing middle eastern for years but have always been fascinated by gypsy and flamenco dance i ve bought several videos some of them better than others but with one exception and that dvd only offered a few steps they don t break down the posture hand movements upper body lower body steps etc lunaris dvd is completely the opposite ! lunaris breaks down both dances into combinations which she then carefully breaks down still further beginning with the absolute basic how to get your skirt up to your hand from there she explains posture and attitude separates and explains upper and lower body steps and hand movements and then demonstrates how to put it all together on top of this lunaris is lovely and her demeanor and accent are delightful she provides additional personal commentary on a few steps too for instance she describes how in spain children learn one hand movement as picking an apple eating the apple throwing the apple away the dvd is so detailed and careful i d happily pay this much for a video that provided just one of these dances i also love the way lunaris explains dance as a language she teaches the steps as vocabulary then suggests that once you know the vocabulary you can improvise to music my only complaint with this video and it s slight enough i still wish i could give this dvd a dozen stars ! is that she faces the viewer and uses terms like this leg instead of right leg nevertheless this dvd is an absolute must buy if you ve ever been intrigued by spanish dance whether gypsy or flamenco it s a fantastic addition for middle eastern dancers who would like to add a little flair to their dance when i m finished with this review i m going to buy both of lunaris other videos ! 
maybe the most honest film on addiction ever made i have heard it said many times that no addiction starts out as a physical dependancy addiction really begins as a psycological spiritual defect deep down inside i think the way that the movie in the beginning showed the insecurity and unease of the two main characters is the most underrated aspect of this brilliant film the alcohol washes away the unease and pain for awhile but when the mask wears off literally all hell breaks loose ! some have commented that jack lemmon s greenhouse scene and subsequent mental ward scene were not realistic i disagree with this as i think his character s mental state was such that a complete breakdown was a very real possibility at that point in the story ultimately this film is more than just a story of the dangers of alcoholism it is a story of the dangers of low self esteem and not loving yourself that is the true breeding ground for addiction and i don t know if there has ever been a film that does a more effective job of illustrating this an absolute classic one for the ages ! 
an entertaining exploration of a fascinating hollywood personality this could also have been entitled the comeback kid though the initial purpose of this documentary on the life and career of famed producer robert evans was perhaps to act as a nice coda to a colorful riches to rags story in fact it has served to put evans back in the public eye and revive his career as a producer only five years ago evans was largely a forgotten man but today he has a number of projects underway no doubt this is in part due to having his various legal problems behind him but clearly his memoir which was then made into this documentary played a major role the kid stays in the picutre is not your typical documentary for one thing the only person who talks to the camera is the subject of the film this is hardly a mea culpa or apologia it is more of a warts and all self affirmation of everything evans has experienced in his career much is left out there is surprisingly little detail on his love life excepting his romance with ali mcgraw which was clearly the dominant relationship of his life but there is a frank acknowledgment of many errors made combined with an attitude that could be summed up well i made a mess but at least it was my mess the heart of the film concerns evans s triumphs as a producer certainly few producers not named weinstein have been involved in so many remarkable films rosemary s baby love story the godfather chinatown marathon man and the cotton club are only a few of the many films he was involved on there are many fascinating stories about many of these though for me the most fascinating was the behind the scenes footage taken during the filming of rosemary s baby another great moment is the short film that evans made for the corporate powers that be who wanted to pull the plug on the godfather almost as important as evans as a character in the film is his beautiful home there is shot after shot of the grounds and the film finally ends with the only contemporary shot of evans in the documentary showing him sitting inside simply being robert evans if the film has a nadir it comes when evans was forced to sell his beloved home to a wealthy foreigner when he wanted to repurchase the home the man wouldn t agree to do so but evans s friend jack nicholson took matters in his own hands and flew to visit the man literally getting on his knees to beg him to sell the house back to evans he relented and one of the most touching moments in the movie was the camera zooming in on the welcome home card that nicholson wrote evans all in all film fans will find this to be an interesting and highly entertaining documentary evans has had a colorful life making his share of mistakes suffering his share of both really great and truly awful luck but sticking it out and partly because of this film the kid did manage to stay in the picture and his name will unquestionably appear on a few more films in the years to come 
the best old movie i ve seen i recently read the fountainhead and atlas shrugged for the first time and found this version of the fountainhead to be the best old movie i ve seen granted i don t watch a tremendous number of old movies but i really enjoyed and recommend this movie

somber subdued and well done serial killer movie here s an oddity a modern day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noises and it takes place in russia there are only two short action scenes but they are horrific the rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders this is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero stephen rea as well yet the story is not depressing and it s very interesting all the way through rea is outstanding as the determined harried looked detective jeffrey demunn is downright scary as the killer donald sutherland s russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmth once again the story is dotted with liberal agendas ie not one but two references to bias against gays the total validity of secular psychology police and government officials being boorish crudebigoted yadda yadda yadda otherwise it s an intelligent and refreshingly low key crime film this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it since it s based on a true life account of this killer it s all the more chilling don t pass this by just because you haven t anything about it 
i love it but i can see why others would hate it this movie s really good it s arty scary gothic and to top it off bauhaus is in the begining it s a really depressing movie but that doesn t take away from anything it just makes you love the movie that much more but it s alittle hard to follow sometimes and the vampires don t really do anything cool they feed by cutting you with there cute little necklesses and then sucking on the wound but it still works there s mad chicks making out too i could see why some people would hate it though it s slow sometimes the artiness can be alittle much sometimes and it s really really depressing but if you re into that sort of thing this movie is perfect for you i loved it i stole it from hollywood video and am still collecting late fees 
another widescreen review picture quality sound quality the overall picture quality is pleasant and satisfying color is nice but pxilazation is very present in the begining of movie improves as movie goes on this being a very senic movie i was not completly happy but still satisfied could ve been a bit sharper and remastered from high definition but wasnt the sound quality in dolby was awesome not in dolby digital but on a system with pro logic ii it souded great if not better than most non digital dolby surround all surround sounds are present and really stood out the soundtrack is placed perfectly and surrounds the room very happpy with this dvd sound quality the movie note spolier the movie was excellent in all entertainment areas if your looking for a fun western movie comedy action stunts scenery and many great actors everything you would want in a quotfunquot western film in the old fashioned tradition light on violence and good enough for the whole family spoiler the best and my favorite thing about this movie is the fact that james garner still plays as maverick even though the audience doesn t know it watching it over and knowing that mel gibson is playing his role as quotthe son of maverick quot and james garner is still the orginal character he played in the past makes this a great movie to watch over and over my overall review is that it is worth buying and i d give it stars if the picture was just a touch better don t be fooled though i have a large projection widescreen tv with a progressive component dvd player so i see almost any grain there is if any is present overall this dvd was satisfying enough to make me happy i bought it on any other tv it will display a perfect picture sound quality is great on a home theatre sound system this is a movie that should be made on a superbit dvd 
give the devil his due a witch betrays her cult is sentenced to wear the mask of satan a spiked facial enclosure bearing the image of the prince of darkness before her punishment the witch utters a curse in the name of satan that she will continue returning throughout the ages resurrecting by their sons blood she becomes vampyr the movie begins with a stern warning to the timid the young advising that it may be too frighting disturbing and so two noblemen a professor his apprentice make their way to the dark castle in the hills on their way they uncover the skeletal remains of the witch who manages to get a taste of their blood thus bringing her to life the castle itself is wonderfully beset with images of griffins gargoyles dragons particular of note a marvellous draconian tapestry adorning an ornate fireplace which holds it will suffice to say many secrets a satanic altar is found deep within the bowels of the castle where the vampire witch sleeps a zombie like guardian lurks who bears the satanic dragon insignia on his chest black sunday manages to preserve quite an eerie embiance much like the undead will keep you in suspense 
preferred the rummer godden documentary in this dvd i watched everything on this dvd and i am giving it a star rating not for the film but rather for the british tv documentary that was included at the end usually i don t watch the special segments on the making of a film the cast the location etc but in this case i found all this information much more interesting than the film itself i think i watched it all because after i watched the film i was somewhat disappointed and wanted to know what exactly all the fuss was about the movie is very visually artistic and enjoyable to watch with that expectation only india was gorgeous and unsurprisingly director renoir kind of made the story and setting into a non stop stream of watercolors i don t think i have ever seen anyone else do it better than he did in this film however as for the storyline i found its presentation too french for me what i mean by this is that i have often found the female characters in french films made by male french directors to be too adoring too emotional or too wicked if not all three at nearly the same time there often is this element of melodrama and sudden emotional swings as if all the females were pms ing at the same time fyi i m female by the way even some of the male characters acted too melodramatically for me i have not read the novel by rummer godden or any of her books for that matter so i do not know if this was how the book was written or was due to free license taken by the director however there was an hour long british tv program about godden s life and her return to india decades later included on this dvd it was excellent ! this dvd is worth watching just for that alone i was mesmerized listening to her tell her life story and watching her reactions as she revisited scenes of her childhood and young womanhood she has had an extraordinary life and she is so honest about herself good and bad to me she was the great work on this dvd and watching the film was the background special bonus material i wondered how she liked the film and listened for her to give some indication maybe i missed it but i don t think so 
very good as expected this yuen woo ping film is very good nice fight choreography and even includes a cameo by simon yuen the hero is the same hero from dance of the drunk mantis which i felt was more entertaining however both buddhist fist and dance of the drunk mantis make excellent additions to your collection 
cats a to z come play with me the cat returns ! this hilarious sequel is great ! the reason why i gave this review its title is because the cat in the hat brings all his friends cats a to z just like thing and thing in the original story these cats reek havoc in the walden home also check out the stories of fox in socks and there s a wocket in my pocket 
worth every penny this is a very enjoyable documentary ordinarily i don t watch movies a second time but this one is so good i purchased it this film follows two surfers from s america as they travel around the world in search of the perfect wave they are gentlemen it is interesting to see the world welcome them americans from a kinder much less vulgar era even though it is now forty years old the production value is high the soundtrack commentary and beautiful scenery all contribute to a very well made film forty years later people continue to buy this movie 
awesome the lord of the rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money but without the awards and critical recognition of the lotr movies not so with viggo mortensen right after lotr he followed with this awesome adventure story by disney coming out the summer after pirates of the caribbean this was supposed to be disney s next big live action summer adventure hit unfortunately it flopped at the box office luckily it has made a comeback on the dvd market which is where this reviewer saw it all in all it is a great movie and probably one of the best live action movies disney has produced in a long while judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb comin short this movie is about frank hopkins half white half native american horserider who is mired in middle age guilt and self remorse along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery a trip to the arabian desert for a race frank takes the challenge with his horse hidalgo and of they go the race across the arabian desert tests both rider and horse and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like disney could have created we have the strong willed girl full of innocence and inner strength a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs an arrogant prince with no moral bounds etc etc it all reminds our protagonist of his days in montana ! during the course of the race which frank and hidalgo win of course both of them are tested to the limit the movie ends on a triumphal note for both the rider redeems his guilt by freeing hidalgo from human ownership forever and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals the soundtrack is awesome the cinematography is great the dialogue is realistic and for once a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area ! my compliments to disney and the cast and crew of this movie i highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up 
a brief comment the incredibles is a fully fleshed out and developed computer animated story that isn t just another summer kiddie flick the incredibles family members aren t cookie cutter cartoon characters but real people who just happen to look like something out of a cartoon the intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years the action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular and after a while you hardly remember you re watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life overall a great effort from pixar and they ll have to work hard to top this one 
one of the best bibically based films this is one of the very best bibically based films ever and it was also on of the best of the early sequels taking up the story precisely where the robe left off it is an even more exciting tale of the greek slave demetrius and his quest to protect the robe jesus wore at his crucifixion a must for the easter season or for any time one needs reaffirmation of faith 
family entertainment now this is a great family movie no need to worry about anything your child shouldn t see simply great music and acting a must have 
fun film interesting story to me this is a fun film as long as you don t go into it expecting much you will find it a good way to occupy your time 
awesome you know i wanted to see this because it was nominated for best picture but in a weird way my expectations were not that high i anticipated a somewhat preachy newsy type movie that would be a little sanctimonious and maybe boring i don t know why i felt that but it must have been some combination of the marketing the best picture nom in itself and the subject matter everything about it screamed important anyway i saw it this weekend and it is actually excellent this is a great story dicaprio does a great job as a menacing but very human south african mercenary i think i was not sure this role would be a good match for him there is lots of action and a moving story at the core i actually think it was better than the departed so in case you re on the fence about getting it because you think it might be all best picture y don t worry about it it s a lot of fun too 
finnaly after years i have found it weeeeeeeeeeeee i love this movie i grew up with the chuck jones kipling series and i love it better than disny which was just too long his were short and left me wanting more when i was like i saw riki tikitavi for the first time at my aunt s houe and even though i am deathly terrified of snakes i loved this movie my parents spent like renting this movie from blockbuster then finnaly it came on nickalodean and we recorded it after time it wore out and we couldnt watch it when i was in th grade my teacher mentioned that we were studying kipling and i got excited when she told us that we were to watch riki tikitavi that was years ago and now i m to this day i can recite that movie from memory which cmes in handy with my theater class the characters are memorable and fantastic and nag and nagaina are still as creepy as ever ! i recomend that children need to see these works of art the white seal mowglii s brothers 
about the movie sudden death this is one of the best fighting action van damme movie film in his whole series of collection a recommendation for those whom are interested in this genre of movie films enjoy

or is it rosenstern and guildencrantz i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of shakespeares works it does help to have an idea of hamlet and i would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost it gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players rosencrantz and guildenstern however it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of hamlet 
not just the cookie the first min of this movie was stragely frighting beyound beleief because it is not a horror flick at this point then it heads into a fairly common wearwolf flick very good flick but not in the psyco class 
a high water mark for journalism and film one of the productions of which he is the most proud robert redford s all the president s men should be required viewing and the woodward bernstein book should be required reading for all who aspire to the profession of journalist redford was fascinated with the story of two young untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the watergate break in until it led to the highest office in the united states redford s involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary so he followed as the story developed he got to know bob woodward and carl bernstein when they were still at ground level still unsure as to where this would all lead but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics redford has always been a political animal with a reporter s instinct and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the american political climate earlier he and director michael ritchie had made the candidate a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well meaning of men or women and a film well worth your time it took two years of hard work to get all the president s men off the ground it was turned down by several studios with the excuse that people were tired of watergate but he was finally able to get warner bros to say yes provided redford himself would star dustin hoffman was enlisted to play carl bernstein redford s old friend jason robards won an oscar as washington post editor inchief ben bradlee jack warden was cast as editor harry rosenfeld martin balsam was editor howard simons jane alexander was judy hoback bookkeeper to the committee to re elect the president creep ned beatty was martin dardis who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence stephen collins was hugh sloan whose wife debbie played by meredith baxter kept his conscience working on the right side robert walden who would go on the the fine television series lou grant was dirty trickster donald segretti and hal holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story the mysterious deep throat who helped woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall of course we now know that deep throat was the fbi s assistant director w mark felt an old friend of woodward s and a man torn between his loyalty to the fbi and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings onredford asked alan j pakula to direct and gordon willis to handle the cinematography and they crafted a look that is part documentary part thriller if you get a chance also see pakula and willis the parallax view starring warren beatty another outstanding scary political film william goldman who won an oscar for butch cassidy and the sundance kid wrote the tight exciting screenplay for which he won again this was actually the fourth time redford and goldman had worked together goldman also adapted donald e westlake s the hot rock a very funny caper film and the poignant the great waldo pepper which was out for a short time on dvd in pan and scan but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful widescreen splendor universal where are you the efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes all the president s men a smashing success it succeeds as an exciting suspenseful procedural as a statement on the neccessity of a free press as a character study and as a great movie moviethe double disc dvd set is the one to buy the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp clean aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by redford himself the second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film on woodward and bernstein and on deep throat there is also a vintage documentary on the making of the film and an interview with jason robards on the dinah shore show a deserved landmark in film and in journalism all the president s men is a must see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be a must own in our darkest hour when all seems obfuscated and hopeless it reminds us that light can be brought to bear people can make a difference 
uptown girls is a very enjoyable movie uptown girls focuses on the friendship that develops between ray an year old going on and molly her nanny who acts her shoe size rather than her age for those who have not seen this movie it may appear corny or designed for a younger audience however it is much more of an adult film than it may outwardly appear in her usual fashion dakota fanning gives an outstanding performance with an aptitude for acting well beyond her years ray and molly s disparate personalities result in many clashes but eventually they teach each other how to act their age a very important life lesson 
classic propoganda film october is a re telling of the events of the russian revolution however it was commissioned as a propoganda piece so that the only character that stands out is lenin who of course is idolized there are the populace and soldiers who are on the side of the bolsheviks but they are basically nameless and faceless as is the other side mensheviks however its not the plot that makes the movie fascinating but the use of montage and imagery sometimes dizzying not quite as good as battleship potemkin but still fascinating certainly not as morally disturbing as triumph of the will which it influenced but still a film made to support a government sanctioned point of view however the crowd shots and the quick cuts from one scene to the next in a rapid but still coherent fashion resonates through current film and even music videos 
a classic i loved this movie when it first came out ! and come on what kid didn t make tomatoe and mayo sandwhichs for the next month after watching it it is and will remain an all time favorite of mine 
a movie filled with universal truths even with a small budget spike lee can still get a lot done and still find great actors spike lee s school daze is probably his best flim standing next to malcomb x respectively the movie was released in years before i even entered college and all of issue that disrupted and seperated the black student body then were still at the forefront when i went to college every character can be found somewhere on your college campus now whether you are at an hbcu or not the movie is filled with many memorable scenes and will leave you with a feeling of belonging to one group or the other either a black fratcat or a black conseious community builder the movie also embodies spike lee s theatrical style that depicts the black culture of the time talks about its issues and in turn influences its future for example this movie influend late s and early s hip hop music the way we dressed and how we thought about hbcu s as a matter of fact southern hbcu s had a enormous growth in enrollment from blacks across the country after this movie was realeased in and the ever so popular freakneak in atlanta ga was born out of this movie it s a must see for any person wanting to know more about college life for black students a great movie 
looker this is an excellent thriller for the time period in which it was created 
joan shines in spruced up classic crawford fans already know that while this movie was a famous flop for joan it contains one of her most interesting performances now they can see it struck from a near immaculate print and enjoy both the gorgeous cinematography and those wild closeups of joan a friend of mine who is not a crawford fan described her look in this movie as quotmakeup poisoning quot personally i love joan s characterization of south seas prostitute sadie thompson highly stylized it s a little ridiuclous but compelling in her quotredeemedquot scenes sadie is quite moving and stunningly beautiful ! this was crawford at her peak sadie s ascent up the staircase to confront walter houston s lustful preacher is brilliantly handled and has to be one of joan s best confrontation scenes ever ranking right up there with mildred slapping veda a little talky and slow in spots but the rewards are worth the wait 
intoxicating mr placido domingo is perhaps the most exciting operatic actor singerof our generation and once again he proves it in this wonderful opera his three great loves baltsa cotrubas serra his rivals and the restof the crew unforgettable 
a wonderful vehicle for errol flynn the performances of flynn and rathbone shine in this fine remake of the o original which conveniently used much of the same aerial footage major brand basil rathbone the commanding officer of a squadron of the british royal flying corps stationed in france has been called a butcher by his top officer captain courtney errol flynn because of his hardened attitude toward sending inexperienced young flyers to their death courtney and his best friend lieutenant scott david niven have their own way of coping with the constant death of new recruits they drink a toast to the dead sing a song and then go back to devising diverting thrill seeking pranks it has been implied that howard hughes sued warner bros claiming that certain story ideas and techniques which were used in this film were curiously similar to some of those used in his o production hell s angels hughes lost the suit when it was determined that the disputed ideas originated with john monk saunders via his personal experiences in the air service it was the basis for the first aa winning film the silent wings in warners blended aspects of their film ceiling zero and this one amp came up with flight patrol among the musical numbers which are heard in this vastly entertaining film include such vintage goodies as pack up your troubles in an old kit bag amp poor butterfly 
uncompromisingly brutal pessimistic and affecting brute force is one of the most violent film noirs of the classic era as well as one of the most pessimistic and this is after some violence was removed to comply with the production code the story takes place within the confines of westgate penitentiary an overcrowded prison whose deficient living conditions and sadistic guards make the inmates lives nearly unbearable prison life is no less than a war between the inmates and guard captain munsey hume cronyn who routinely uses blackmail and torture to control the prisoners when the warden revokes all the inmates privileges in response to the deaths of two men inmate joe collins burt lancaster hatches a violent and risky escape plan with his cellmates and a senior well respected prisoner named gallagher charles bickford director jules dessin doesn t let a glimmer of hope into this film the violence is brutal and wholly without sentiment or regret the utter hopelessness of the situation in the prison is overwhelming brute force is the only means in westgate penitentiary the standout performance is by hume cronyn as the nazi inspired captain munsey an unabashed sadist who uses social darwinism to rationalize absolute dominance of the prisoners who are after all behind bars not free to challenge him the prison doctor a disgraced surgeon named walters art smith numbs himself with alcohol and articulates the film s themes do you know what this prison is he says one big human bomb ! the film is a little too long and the flashback scenes of wives and girlfriends are superfluous this is perhaps the most blatantly existential film noir it takes the position of sartrean philosophy articulated by dr walters which is juxtaposed with nietzschean philosophy articulated by capt munsey i m not normally captivated by either of these schools of thought but brute force kept me interested for the duration of the film it is a brutal beautiful film with sharp dialogue solid character writing and great attention to detail the dvd image entertainment this is a good print of the film with no obvious image or sound problems bonus features include filmographies of director jules dessin writer richard brooks and of the film s stars choose filmographies then next to see them the stills and pressbook gallery minutes is a slideshow with accompanying them music by miklos rozsa of production stills posters and advertisements for the film 
i remember how the meaning of words began to change v for vendetta is an interesting movie that won t allow you to remain indifferent love or hate it i m pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film based on a comic written by alan moore adapted to the big screen by the wachowski brothers and directed by james mcteigue the story begins in england but not in the england we know mcteigue s england is eerily similar to the country that orwell s tells us about in there is a dictator chancellor adam sutler john hurt that was chosen in free elections but that afterwards decided to become an absolute ruler exerting power without any kind of restriction the citizens do nothing they have relinquished their right to participate and to decide and are merely sheep being told what to do and what to think their freedom is curtailed but they feel safe however someone is prepared to shake their certitude and make them realize that things are not what they seem to be that person is v hugo weaving a man that is willing to risk everything in order to turn meek sheep into citizens and to wreak havoc on the enemies that destroyed his life a long time ago evey natalie portman a young woman that v rescues from sutler s minions is a privileged spectator of v s plans and the first person to become a fervent follower that path though is not easy as evey s new strenght will be forged in the fires of prison this is a highly controversial movie that delves upon difficult subjects for example whether the end validates the means and the power of words all the same v for vendetta makes you think has great actors an original cinematography and a hectic pace from my point of view this film is simply a must see belen alca 
it s jimmy carr need more be said thanks for keeping a brit sane in a country full of my wife says jokes your wife is fat and ugly and i don t care what she says because she s ugly and fat and not my wife 
great movie but poor transfer this is my favorite version of the book the romance between jane seymour s ethne and beau bridge s harry is the key to the story here which is the way it should be the story of course is also solid however this is dvd sports an iffy transfer that seems to have been taken from some shoddy elements the sound also is iffy in parts i love this movie though so i had no hesitation in picking up this dvd 
foxfire heddy burress shines foxfire is a good story wonderfully acted about a group of girls who reject being pushed around by the men in their life one a teacher one a parent margret angelina jolie is the stranger who wanders into town and befriends maddy wonderfully played by hedy burress heddy burress was a newcomer to movies when she starred in this film and delivered a poignant thoughtful performance it s a shame hedy hasn t played more prominent roles in subsequent films she does a lot of voice over work to pay the bills 
hilarious i love this movie i laughed through the whole movie if you haven t watched this movie then i suggest that you do however do not let your kids watch that is unless you don t mind them watching r rated movies just remember its rating so you can know what to expect 
nastalgia my goodess ! i cannot believe that so many others had only slight memories of the details of the film and yet it had such an impact and never left their thoughts i ve periodically thought about the red balloon for over years and was just reminded to search for it when my aunts beau was talking about some of the scenes at thanksgiving dinner and i just screamed thats it ! i haven t purchased it yet but thanks to you all for the reviews i m going to get it right now 
very compelling movie saw this film recently all the way through the thing that grabs you is the natural way the film is presented in without compromise or hestiation strogn writing acting is what carry this film from start to finish the pacing of the film keeps your attention from start to finish 
great movie i don t know why but i love this movie i recommend if you haven t seen this movie have a couple beers and clean your guns while watching 
two great actors in a great movie boys town stars two of the greatest actors of the golden era of hollywood mickey rooney and spencer tracy and their parts in this movie are among their best roles boys town doesn t have quite as close a connection to christmas as the other two titles in the classic holiday collection theres one scene set on the holiday but this true story of a priest who builds a boarding school for troubled youth is one that will warm your heart tracy plays father flanagan a kind socially conscious priest who can be tough when he needs to be and mickey rooney displays his wide ranging acting talent from tough talk to tears as one of the neglected boys whom flanagan sets on the right path boys town is accompanied by its own less famous sequel men of boys town so you re getting two features on one disc you also get a featurette about the real boys town which still exists and has expanded beyond its original nebraska location as well as a radio program promoting the movie with tracy and rooney if you like this great movie you may want to consider getting the excellent classic holiday collection which includes this film along with two other great classics christmas in connecticut and a christmas carol

great show works now avatar is one of my favorite shows i am so thrilled that it is on amazon at first the episode i downloaded didn t work but they fixed the bugs i have it on my creative zen vision m and it looks great 
rob reiner s best the princess bride is hour and minutes of excellent entertainment it is based on the book of the same name which is worth checking out as well the witty dialog and charm of the movie is no accident it comes straight from the book the movie is set in medieval times in a fictitious kingdom called floren and it is a story of true love the heroine and hero buttercup and westley express and affirm their love for each other but are then separated and the movie is the story of their efforts to re unite a subplot involves a spanish sword fighter s year quest to avenge his father s murder and these two story lines are rounded out by an affable giant s effort to be helpful in both situations the princess bride begins and ends and is interspersed with a modern day scene a wise and loving grandfather reading the original book to his smart aleck grandson who is sick in bed this plot device works wonderfully as it draws us in and makes the story which is already pretty good even more personal and lovable there is not a dull scene in the entire picture and there are many superb performances whenever you can say that peter falk s performance ranks lowest among those of the principle actors and actresses you know that the quality of the acting is pretty high and such is the case here the best job is turned in by cary elwes who plays westley he is very charming and likable and he handles some pretty complicated scenes and lines with ease or so it seems robin wright as princess buttercup is also excellent her natural beauty and innocence make her character a woman who without a doubt a man would risk his life to rescue mandy patinkin plays the spanish sword fighter indigo and he makes him into an endearing and good hearted character even though he s a character who kills people with his sword the giant is played by the good hearted andre the giant a role straight out of the book and a role that andre seemingly was born to play andre is kind of hard to understand at times in the film english was his second language in real life but his good nature comes through loud and clear fred savage plays the sick grandson and he absolutely nails the part chris sarandon plays the bad guy prince humperdinck it must be a thankless job to play the heavy but here he is none theless effective and it is easy for us to loathe his character but the princess bride rob reiner s best movie i think is the story of the triumph of love over adversity there is plenty of action and plenty of suspense and drama but it is this theme of love that gives the movie its life 
the cutting edge gold medal edition the fil is good and interesting you can enjoy and pass the tim 
it almost goes the whole way to perfect this movie was really on track to be an earth shattering experience for us sci fi geeks here s why creeped out techno music not creepy and etherel in itself but creeped out in the sense that everything is angled and black and white in contrast to the driving beat it s incessant and a great effect max s voice overs add to the overall creepiness fantastic concept brilliant really every pattern can be graphed what if you could graph the pattern of nature and discover a secret formula to life max is in it to win it for the sake of knowledge not great stuff tonsosuspense the movie really builds up well almost too well as my one negative comment will show you will get a really strong sense that something of major importance is going to be revealed if you keep watching tripped out lead character complete with hallucinations quirkiness and the obligatory disdain for normal human contact we re talking visions of brains that shriek and vibrating walls the lead character is great if not a little contrived at times by the actor i mean he s getting revelations to the meaning of life the universe and everything by the swirling eddies in his coffee ! yes but i only gave pi stars for a reason the letdown i mentioned that this movie makes you feel like it s building up to something so grand that it may even aid you in your own life i mean i was right there hook line and sinker but i was left on the line at the end the ending isn t bad but it seems like a cop out max solves the problem by drilling a hole in his skull no more special gift no more math at the speed of thought no more secret formula or mystery dang i was disapointed i tried really hard not to be because the movie had me so enthralled but i didn t get the whambam experience i was hoping for at the end however i would highly recomend you checking it out for yourself i ve spoken with a lot of folks who totally disagree with me and dig the ending great addition to your underground sci fi pick it up ste 
carl sagan inspired many with his series cosmos it was a great experience for me to see the quotman behind cosmos quot a series that years ago changed my life 
another great slater film having seen parts of this film over a span of the last decade or so without fully seeing all of it i noticed this dvd on sale at a huge retailer rhymes with ball mart for only i couldn t resist picking it up to see it all finally was it worth it yes i am a straight married guy and a huge fan of christan slater i have seen damn near every movie with him in it and pump was another classic did i love everything about this movie no it definately reeks of late s references and inuendo i e bill and ted clones the story was very well done however it contains major flaws i am a cop and i know for a fact the federal government would not send the fcc after a lone pirate station who is not screaming for the downfall of government but is ranting about the local high school administration i didn t like the ending i won t spoil it for you but just say it could have been better overall it was a out of not bad for a film from 
when comes the end of this movie this is a very tedious movie about a female rancher played by jane fonda who is trying to eek out a living at the same time she is trying to atone for fornicating with the bad guy which broke her daddy s heart so she kinda has her hands full then james cann arrives all shot up and she has to be a nurse too then the two of them along with their elderly ranch hand try to drive cattle and make a good sale this movie is only redeemed by the wonderful performance of veteran actor richard farnsworth who i understand started his career as a stuntman j r ewing s daddy is also in thus movie with the unlikely name of julie 
fantastic soundtrack too love this film as i have reached the ripe old age of thirtysomething no don t get me started i hated that show but cannot resist the anachronism and am now married with kids it is just so funny to watch this movie again and relate to get angry with the characters been there done that and admittedly will probably do it again and again 
its silly but i love you i wanted to see you to see if i d want to see you i finally did it i finished watching bout de souffle aka breathless i kept putting it off because i usually have problem when everybody tells me that such and such film is the epitome of its era or it breaks all the rules starts the revolution and reinvents the cinema well bout de souffle does not put you under the pressure it takes you for a ride and you follow for minutes its incredibly young characters common crook jeanpaul belmondo and his american free spirited girlfriend jean seberg on their journey on the streets of th paris along with raoul coutard s legendary camera i am not going to tell here how great the camera work was how fantastic the music score and the views of paris were the fans of the film know that already they also know about the beginning of french new wave and how it influenced the future cinema i just want to say that the movie was made over forty years ago the smoking was cool back then and belmondo made smoking look very sexy belmondo fascinates me in this film i ve seen him in a lot of later movies he s always been good i recommend le magnifique and le professionnel but in bout de souffle he is not just good he is embodiment of cool his face changes its expression every moment you can not take your eyes off him is it me or he does remind the very young mick jagger not commonly handsome but irresistible and sexy he and young she was at the time jean seaborg made one of the best screen couples ever my favorite scenes michel drives the stolen car in the beginning of the film and he starts to talk to us the audience the day is nice the sun is shining and the life is beautiful michel and patricia drive in the convertible the wind plays with her short hair we only see the back of her head and her neck michel tells her that he loves the girl with a beautiful neck wrists knees but she is a chicken patricia comes to the hotel to find michel in her bed they start talking about nothing and about very serious things they smoke she tries to find a good place for her new poster and he wants to sleep with her in the end of the scene his face he looks at her there is love in that look there is more i am sure everyone who saw it has his her favorite scenes 
fandango i have loved watching this movie through out the years on tv when offered the original road trip kevin costner s best movie in my opinion 
what are you nuts or something maybe woodrow comes from a small close knit town in california his grandfather owned the land the town was built on and his father was a brave marine who die for his country so when woodrow is kicked out of the marines after one month for chronic hay fever he s too embarrassed to go home he works for a year at the shipyards and mails letters home via outgoing soldiers one fateful evening some marines on leave hear his tale and concoct a fake war hero story and escort him home thinking that only his poor worried mother will hear their lies they even gather up some medals for him but when they arrive on the train woodrow s greeted by a cheering crowd and five marching bands all playing different songs at one time the mayor gives woodrow the key to the city the town folk pay off his mother s mortgage they nominate woodrow for the upcoming race for mayor a statue is being erected and they even write a song about him woodrow tries over and over to tell everybody the truth but each time he does the lie only gets bigger and bigger made the same year as sturges screwball classic the miracle of morgan s creek this movie has a number of the same actors i lost count at and is almost as funny but for some reason it s kinda slipped through the cracks would make a great double feature with the miracle of morgan s creek why is there not a preston sturges dvd box set d preston sturges the miracle of morgan s creek the lady eve woodrow lafayette pershing truesmith eddie bracken the miracle of morgan s creek home alone libby ella raines the senator was indiscreet brute force sgt heppelfinger william demarest the miracle of morgan s creek it s a mad mad mad mad world 
acting masterclass served on a silver tray there are no axe murderers lurking in the closet but joseph losey s decadent class struggle allegory the servant matches polanski s repulsion as a classic of psychological horror dirk bogarde delivers a note perfect performance as the manservant hired by snobby playboy james fox in his screen debut to help him settle into his new upscale london digs it soon becomes apparent to the viewer that this butler has a little more on the agenda than just polishing silverware and dusting the mantle actors talk about giving the character an inner life just watch bogarde s facial expressions and see a craftsman at work ! a young and quite alluring sara miles is memorable as bogarde s sister who is hired as the maid if you ve seen wings of the dove or days of heaven you will likely figure things out early on but you ll enjoy the ride all the same the expressive chiaroscuro cinematography sets an increasingly claustrophobic mood as the story progresses watch for the clever use of convex mirrors to trap the images of the principal characters by the way if you are a fan of s british folk music you ll want to keep your eyes and ears peeled for a rare unbilled and all toobrief glimpse of legendary and reclusive guitarist davey graham playing and singing livenot dubbed in a scene where james fox walks into a coffeehouse the dvd is bare bones but picture and sound are excellent a must see 
down to earth nice easy going flick to watch cute and corny makes for a great popcorn companion 
great movie about dysfunctional family at christmas what can you say about the ultimate dysfunctional family king henry keeps his wife locked in a castle miles away and only lets her out on holidays it s a great christmas movie think i m nuts watch the film you can t beat peter o toole and kate hepburn duking it out over which of three unsavory son s will take over the realm it was a terrific play and translates well to the screen killer dialogue the dvd it s self was a good widescreen transfer nothing major in the extras category but a solid dvd of a terrific movie i wish they d hurry up and put out becket 
bloody amazing when you consider the physical condition olivier was in his performance is pretty damn good the supporting cast are mostly excellent with diana rigg a standout as a venal vicious voracious yet strangely feline and alluring regan and dorothy tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful goneril leo mckern is the definitive gloucester 
not quite purrfect but close this is one of those movies that you think to yourself this wacked out stuff could entirely happen because honestly this wacked out stuff could entirely happen where this movie misses is that when they are going for the serious they are really kinda funny however when they are going for the funny they end up just kind of lame and honestly the whole fern violette subtext waaay to over the top they could have simply bribed her by putting her in the spotlight not redirecting the spotlight toward her and then marveling at the monster that they created great cameo from marilyn manson as the greaser in the bar and the donna s playing the prom i went to see them in concert and they are almost worth picking up this movie all on their own 
i need to be a hero as this wonderful movie opens we enter the world of eve s bayou the louisiana home of ten year old eve jurnee smollett and her charming philandering father louis samuel l jackson her glamorous and superstitious mother her psychic aunt debbi turner and her big sister who idolizes daddy as much as eve does the narrator s opening line concerns a murder and we wait for this terrible event to occur i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie it drew me in and held me spellbound with it s believable story and likeable characters we really get to know and care about eve s family and all their secrets the actors are uniformly excellent especially the young star jurnee smollett the director succeeds by constantly reminding us of the picturesque bayou setting and its unique community as the story got closer and closer to the inevitable tragedy i was almost holding my breath it s an intense story about real multi layered people highly recommended 
creative surreal n crazy i enjoyed the film it was uncanny bizarre and colorful wow it was a nice family movie 
indiana jones and the temple of ick the quotindiana jones quot trilogy will endure for a long time everyone adores cliffhangers and romance and these three films have plenty of both of the three the middle film indiana jones and the temple of doom is by far the ickiest the assortment of bugs monkey brains millipedes burning bodies and unique open heart surgeries are visually more stunning than tangles of snakes and melting nazis but like the other two temple of doom is loaded with action great pacing and on themoney performances 
competition this is a good cartoon for competition with rocket robin hood hope they come to quick agreable turms msp didnt see the black wolf or fox 
enjoyable even if it isn t your usual fare as an american watching a translation it s sometimes difficult to determine a film makers intent ever since crouching tiger hidden dragon we in the west have had to re evaluate martial arts cinema its not always about revenge sometimes it seems pretty inexplicable you know different culture different philosophy etc thats what i m told anyway since i don t speak chinese i couldn t exactly say what gets lost in translation regardless of culture or genre the big question always has to be did you like the movie well yes i liked it i don t know if i get all of it but i liked it the action sequences and special effects are soundly executed without taking over the film the actors are enjoyable to watch and i actually got the jokes there were many at the end of the movie i felt like i d watched a story and not just fluff there was a theme and hidden plot behind all those flying people with swords you gotta like that 
baseball fans will enjoy this one the curse of the grebes is sort of a tribute to the red sox return to world series glory with cameos by damon timlin and renteria timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by emily dickinson with remarkable aplomb arthur changes gears is also great he gets a bike he s been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he s so worried about getting it dirty that he won t ride it 
classic james cagney performance in one of the landmark gangster films of the depression era few performers have become so identified with one particular type of role as james cagney did with the gangster genre and even though in later decades he proved his ability in many diverse areas of screen acting his tough guy playing in early classics like warner bros studios hard hitting gangster story public enemy is what stays in the mind 
i loved this video this is an amazingly soothing relaxing routine that leaves you feeling mellow and at the same time is good for you as on her other videos mirabai holland provides lots of information in this case about the importance of stretching for flexibility and slowing down the aging process she explains the physiology of muscles and connective tissue in an easy to understand way clear explanation of all the movements no equipment needed an easy to follow routine that is de stressing and soothing it leaves you feeling incredibly mellow 
assassination buffs this is a must you may not agree with all the wild conspiracy ideas and you may believe in the lone assassin like myself however i really think in order to take a stand you need to read the warren report and have a dvd of the zapruder film these are the essentials then i would suggest to buy an early period conspiracy book like six seconds in dallas and a book that shows the flaws in the warren report like accessories after the fact only then would i suggest getting into the deep conspiracy ideas 
really my all time favorite my husbands laughs when i say a movie is my favorite i have many favorites but this one really is i also love to read and what sets this adaptation apart is the way the two complement eachother truly brilliant the movie adds elements that the book didn t dwell on and the book covers all the details that movies just can t some movies can touch your heart in such a way that they leave you a bit raw for me this is one of those movies no it may not be a cinematic event for all but for those who have loved with their whole heart and have been or even risked being hurt you will find a good laugh and a few tears here only nora ephron herself could have wrote a screenplay that complemented her novel so well and thankfully mike nichols brought it to life in such a way meryl streep really is at her best here and the whole cast is excellent i really do love this movie it always amazes me that it is so underrated give it a try 
cute movie i like both cary grant and doris day and i really enjoyed watching that touch of mink and i wish they had made more movies together besides this just one btw i also liked audrey meadows who played doris day s friend she was pretty funny 
a new meaning to coming out this french film is one of the funniest movies ever with great writing and a cast of huge talents it all begins in a condom manufacturing plant with a boring accountant daniel auteuil who overhears from a bathroom stall that he will be fired from his position upon returning home he informs his ex wife and son of his pending predicament and vows to find another job in order to keep them in alimony he meets a new neighbor michel aumont who convinces him not to jump from his balcony and the fun soon begins together they concoct a story to save his job believing that if he can convince his company that he is really gay he will save his position by suggesting a prejudice exists the company sends its dogs out to fend off any chance of a lawsuit and uses the services of its most macho employee gerard depardieu to romance away any perceived distaste for the new discovery from here the story spins and weaves into a web of hilarious lies that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter this film is so well written and easy to follow that the sub titles are easily accepted by even the most english of all english speakers while some of the references in this film might be taken harshly by those of the gay persuasion it is really only a lighthearted stab at all of the stereotypes that lurk within a corporate existence boring accountants could also take offense for that matter ! auteuil is fantastic as the bumbling lead depardieu is never better as the macho man who eventually finds his true passion aumont wonderful as the helpful neighbor with a few secrets of his own the incomparable jean rochefort adds his own brand of humor to the film cast as the company ceo and the cast just continues into a complete brilliance if you love to laugh especially at yourself this film will keep you in stitches and one viewing will leave you wanting more for collectors of comedy films this one is a must have so forget your hang ups and enjoy a moment out of whatever closet suffocates you 
i love this movie this movie has great actors a great screenplay and a great director i can t fully write how good this film is and why it s considered a classic it won the best picture oscar and is one of the few winners that really deserve the mention as an award winning film the director made the romance is low key which makes sense considering the cynical nature of the film billy wilder director also knew when to inject humor and when to inject drama very few directors are good at having a sense of when to incorporate humor into a dramatic moment any other time it just distracts and messes up the flow of the picture but here wilder kept things smooth i also love the ending which from my viewpoint is perfect considering the cynical mood set by the characters this film has a little romance mixed with a dash of drama and a hint of comedy making a delightful piece of classic hollywood film 
you wet socks why are you crying you should pull yourselves up it is one of the best movies i have ever watched amazingly funny sometimes sometimes deeply heart breaking just like life itself is tony leung chu wai acts wonderfully faye wong is so lovely you will be longing to see all wong kar wai movies after this that s what i did and i do not regret at all i am a fan 
powerful and moving this is a fine film that stresses the importance of culture and family while never losing its entertainment value following the same mexican american family from one generation to the next the film crams a lot into a two hour running time but the story is effective well told and moving while some of it was a bit far fetched especially jennifer lopez s opening bit as the younger version of maria the mother crossing an angry river with her newborn son the film does pick up and becomes a moving epic about a tough family and their struggles the casting is terrific each cast member very believable with their strong performances i enjoyed this movie and it made me appreciate all my parents have done to keep our family together this is a terrific slice oflife made enjoyable by the realism and top notch cast 
slap stick fun comedy absolute fun classic with classy slap stick fun never a dull moment in this film really funny fun they don t make them like this anymore fun for entire family and all ages 
another good csi ny though csi ny is most least favorite of the three csis they still manage to make a good one sometimes this is one of those good ones 
good but not the best one of better movies from jacq clusoe series although not the best there are some dull moments but also plenty of laughs supported by peter sellers antics recommended for pink panther series funs but also for those who love european comedies in general 
charming classic i remember this movie from my childhood i remember seeing in theaters when it was first released back in and i remember it being a huge hit now i d like to purchase it on dvd but i kind of hesitate to because i haven t heard many good things about the quality of this dvd issue not the film the dvd after seeing some screenshots online i am shocked to find the film deteriorating far beyond it s original brilliance i remember it being sharp bright and colorful after having seen robin hood four years before the animation used in the rescuers looked so refreshing and lively and above all well done however it seems that lines have thickened colors have faded and the entire print has become subject of artifacts and scratches shameful it seems so unfair that up to this day films that are even less than are getting massive restoration undergoings while other older movies are left to rot to this kind of state disney is it so much to ask that you should treat all your timeless classics equaly they all deserve it yes all even the black cauldron oliver company or one hundred and one dalmatians well that s all i d like to say for this film i will not have to think twice about purchasing it as soon as the dvd release is what it trully should be 
tati looks like a s chuck jones cartoon but thats good jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled conveniences and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long and several scenes notably the garden party would have benefited by judicious paring still the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy 
down and out in beverly hills this movie has timeless humor and is lots of fun it s widescreen so you don t get a chopped up picture if they had only included the little richard video great gosh a mighty its a matter of time it would be perfect 
by the light of the silvery moon this is pure clean fun it is cute and doris day and gordon macrae make a cute pair it is a great family film that makes you feel good worth owning 
the best of the bounties even though it tends to drag and the abuse gets a bit repetitive this is by far the best adaptation of the famous british navy story gable and laughton are perfect for their respective roles and the period is brilliantly displayed i m not a huge gable fan this and gone w the wind are abt all i like him in 
perfect late night movie basically this is a perfect zombie movie it has everything you could want in one and more i think the director really hit the mark on what zombie movies are really about im not positive but i think this movie was intentially cheesy i mean comon to quote a line from the begining of the movie where a man encounters a zombie no please no im your friend no sorry buddy your zombie food the whole movie was done in a serious manner but once you catch a glimpse of michael or even hear some of the things he has to say theres no way you cant laugh what can i say zombies incest gratutious nudity this film has it all but besides being sucha lovable movie this is a hardcore zombie film if what your looking for is some zombie flesh eating and bright red gore burial ground has more than enough to please you anyway if this isint one of the best zombie movies ever made its for sure one of the most entertaining 
who do you say that i am the greatest story ever told had the very real potential of being one of the biggest disasters in motion picture history think about it for a moment who would want to sit through a hour and minute film about jesus with a virtually unknown blond haired blue eyed swedish actor named max von sydow in the lead role add to that the fact that the artistic integrity of the film was likely to be ruined by the studios decision to populate the feature with a multitude of cameo appearances by just about every living movie star in hollywood sure signs of impending doom surrounded this project surely director george stevens pulled off a major miracle aided by one of the finest soundtracks in motion picture history provided by the legendary alfred newman some of the most gorgeous cinematography and set designs you ll ever see and an unforgetable performance by max von sydow the greatest story ever told lived up to it s title to become the definitive film version on the life of jesus of nazareth a classic from that belongs in everyones dvd library one of the essentials 
whens the future spike lee has said in hindsight that he d lost his abilities as a filmmaker between do the right thing and malcolm x if that s true you won t be able to tell during jungle fever at least not in a way you d expect jungle fever is a lot of things daring empassioned extreme overarching undeniably and intentionally heavy but amateurish it is not watching jungle fever now made me realize all the power lee movies entail which is especially at this point in his career a real voice two scenes of extremes are rendered in equal precision a group of african american women discussing the problems of keeping their men contrasting with an equally long and empassioned scene of pugnacious racism between a group of bensonhurst italians in each scene the experience of its characters is given vividness by the authenticity of the dialogue by the conviction of its cast and of the cast let me add what a treasure of an ensemble it is years later virtually every supporting role some on screen for just minutes has become a recognizable performer its a game in itself to count how many oscar emmy tony and grammy wins nominations not to mention plush sopranos roles these actors share in its leading roles wesley snipes has a seething immediacy john turturro burns with conscience and samuel l jackson in the most fearless performances of his career unfolds so many gripping layers at once the cannes jury created a special acting prize to honor him all that helps make jungle fever provocative in the right ways sparking conversations as well as personal speculations about the modern state of racism of the way that we re never free of our own cultural expectations and how they effect who and how we love the movie s first giant nagging flaw is its attempt to handle too much the plot that follows the path of crack addiction belongs to a terrific different movie its second and this is tougher is that the notion of this fever of flipper snipes and angie annabella sciorra being blinded by each others race is an unfulfilled idea in the movie the characters i m afraid work better as catalysts for thier environments than they do as lovers as their affair is remote and sciorra a gifted actress elsewhere seems far too cold for fevers of any kind yet even these flaws are the product of a force already at work on the film industry the movie suffers only from an ambition to reach all aspects of the urban race experience and succeeds as well as can be expected you ll rarely recall a film who fails its goals this intriguingly 
new holiday kids classic what a great movie moving funny and thoroughly entertaining the kids come across and real the acting is great particularly john corbett and stacy edwards and the plot moves along really well the sequel is better than the original i think this ll be shown every holiday season for quite a while 
favorite episode it was one of my favorite episodes a way to get buffy and angel together without changing the storyline and the characters where able to express how they felt to each other 
no one s been able to live in it it doesn t want people one of the supposed reasons why ghosts remain in this world is that they were murdered and want the world to know who did it so expect a lot of that in the changeling a quiet compelling ghost story that harkens back to old fashioned chillers no ghouls buckets of blood chainsaws or serial killers instead this movie relies on outstanding acting and a timeless feeling that permeates the simple story and it ll scare the skin off you john russell george c scott is on a trip with his wife and daughter when a freak car accident kills them both months later the grieving composer moves to seattle and rents an enormous historical house trying to bury himself in his new job but there are odd sounds and sights in his house faucets running eerie voices the piano clashing and a boy drowned in the tub john becomes increasingly desperate to find out the truth assisted by the real estate agent who got him the house trish van devere with seances visions and a well under the floorboards he begins to piece together a terrible crime from many years ago and the changeling that the ghost wants revenge on anyone who wants blood special effects and lots of screaming had better look elsewhere for their horror kicks the changeling is a very different kind of movie think shirley jackson not stephen king where a wheelchair rattling down the stairs is enough to make your hair stand on end and do i detect some influence on the ring in certain scenes this movie also feels elegant and timeless old mossy mansions horseback riding in damp forests and a composer trying to overcome his grief peter medak drapes the movie in beautiful visuals and allows the viewers to get to know the characters before the plot really gets moving then the changeling becomes creepy very fast the plot grows more suspenseful with every scene building with every new discovery a wheelchair a baptismal medal and a bathtub until something has to erupt the ghost never appears except in flashbacks an appalling murder scene but his keening voice can be heard over and over george c scott gives a pitch perfect performance as the mild slightly reclusive john who is still suffering from his losses and trying to move on with his life van devere comes across as a bit annoying at first but she also serves as a good counterpoint to scott as well as a potential love interest whenever he s ready melvyn douglas also has a good brief role as a politician with a deep dark secret less is more in the changeling a movie whose scares spring from its exceptional scripting eerie ghost and great acting just don t watch this one alone in the house at night 
funny funnyfunny even though this is about years old it is extremely halarious i ve been waiting to see a good stand up comedy the first min is just one hilarious hit after another i love this guy 
thriller i would agree with several other reviewers that this is a moving and captivating thriller ! in the rare case that home invasions occur they are absolutely frightening rourke is one of the best actors playing a slimy thug he is very believable and anthony hopkins is as usual brilliant michael bosworth is a seasoned sociopath mickey rourke and hopkins provides a great good vs evil contrast in this one probably not for children under 
dvd clear vivid picture with great sound bought in brand new condition and i was completely satisfied 
a classic from the s this movie is an excellent buy for those who enjoy classics of the s s i especially enjoyed richard widmark s performance in his first role as the unstable evil laughing gangster tommy udo victor mature does a respectable job as the former miscreant trying to start a clean new life by cutting a deal with the district attorney to squeal on the nasty udo all inall it s an enjoyable classic that i would definitely recommend 
lolita lolita lolita one reason to watch this film lolita davidovich if you don t fall in love with her character and become completely mesmerized by her looks you need to check your pulse her portrayal as olivia is right on richard gere and sharon stone also put in good performances but you keep asking yourself as you are watching yo rich ! are you kiddin choose the redhead completely bashed by critics i think critics can t stand gere or stone and lolita got caught in the crossfire she s a talented actress and deserved much more ado for her performance 
first rate where the sidewalk ends is a winning film noir detective story dana andrews plays a troubled cop with a reputation for abusing suspects in fact he is whacked with a demotion at the very outset events get complicated when he slaps around his very next perp a war hero and the guy hits his head and dies ! wse quickly is in high gear da attempts a clumsy cover up his new boss karl malden quickly fingers rough and tough tom tully as the murderer he is the perfect fall guy but the audience not to mention da knows he is innocent the plot boils when da gets involved with tully s daughter gene tierney here is the perfect uptown girl in a decidedly downtown location this plot contrivance is actually believable will da let his girlfriend s dad go to sing sing for a death he caused the resolution is unmentioned here viewers will have to watch wse for themselves but those who do will not be disappointed wse is fast moving and highly credible there are the required nighttime shots of sleazy night spots dingy tenements dark alleys and dank garages if there was a daytime scene this viewer missed it the suspense is maintained throughout even though the audience has all the evidence the reuniting of andrews tierney after laura by director preminger is a complete success this reviewer made a mistake ! he was reading silver and ward s film noir and peeked at the ending ! even so the resolution to wse was still a great one almost shocking ! viewers are urged to savor the atmosphere in this film noir detective classic and take that fadeout as it comes 
awesome pirate movie great performances highlight this exciting tongue incheek adventure robert shaw and james earl jones are wonderful as is a fine supporting cast of character actors of special note is the outstanding performance of peter boyle as a first class nasty villain ! seeing him today in everybody loves raymond and then as pure evil is really something to behold also watch for a tremendous sword fight between shaw and boyle that ranks with the best of them youll really enjoy this one 
great movie but this dvd needs to be dressed up a bit more first of all i m reviewing the dvd product and not the movie this is one of those movies that you either get or you don t if you ve searched for this movie and bought it chances are you get it so i won t write about the movie itself this is possibly the most disturbing unique and fun kids movie ever i wish there had been some sort of documentary on the dvd even if all the original people involved in the production are no longer with us just some commentary from a film historian would have been interesting just what impact did this film have when it was released in also the dvd navigation acted strangely when i was in the bonus cartoon the return to menu function on my dvd player didn t work i had to hit stop and reboot the dvd to get out of the cartoon and back to the main menu the bonus cartoon however was a wonderful surprise an original gerald mcboing boing cartoon gerald mcboing boing s symphony i d never seen one of these and i totally loved it so i got a great and fascinating movie and a wonderful bonus cartoon but i was left wanting to learn more and all i had left to look at were a few black and white still pictures from the production 
pretty pretty i love this movie maybe it s because it seemed so risque as a kid or maybe it s because jane hates it whatever it s great fun sure the script leaves much to be desired and yea the special effects suck it was what do you want but that only adds to its charm it s a funny movie more on the silly side this is true camp and if you like campy flicks this one has to be in your collection 
talk about christmas spirit i really love bones it has everything suspense drama humor pretty people fun storylines i have yet to miss an episode and even into season this is probably my favorite it adds depth to all of the characters also the winter holidays are my favorite time of year i like holidays that are about what is good in the world bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day i cry through half this episode but in a completely good way buy watch it love it but watch it with a friend if you don t want to cry alone so moving great performances by the whole cast emily deschanel was powerful in this one she brings real vulnerability to brennan here david boreanaz as always the perfect sympathetic hero loveably old fashioned cute funny moments touching poignant moments this really is the best of what is great about bones 
unforgetable actually this film really deserves stars ! i first saw this movie on pay per view somewhere in the later part of the s and you know how there are really only a few titles to great flicks that you can actually remember put it this way years later i still never forgot my family the cast is wonderful the acting couldn t be better it reaches into the soul of the heart and is one heck of a film that you ll never forget 
kind friendly and enjoyable sure this movie has some bad acting and low budget animation but i don t care about that the plot was very good it was touching and the end was very pleasing the only thing that bugs me is that it hardly seems like it s a sequal to the original because the draogn is young and doesn t have the wisdom of draco from the original but it is still good the movie is probably meant for a younger audience but i think people of all ages would enjoy this movie 
watch it ! love it this is one of my all time favorite movies read the book if you want the backstory since the screenplay starts at the half point it s entertaining and that s why we see movies in the first place right matt damon is just so darn likeable you get drawn into his narration right off the bat the screenplay was very well done it is a coppola film after all he does work with some talented people it was very nice to see theresa wright in this film as well 
dreamlike alice starts harmlessly enough as we meet her a dissatisfied ny housewife married to a wealthy banker the fun starts when she goes to a chinese doctor played by a brilliant actor whose name i cannot remember and he gives her various remedies to her problems this kind of plot could easily fall into caricature and cliche but miraculously doesn t the cast play their parts subtly and honestly and support the movie s delicate frame mia is enchanting as alice and i don t usually feel this way about her this quiet film is one that stays with me each time i see it i enjoy it more 
informative this was my first download and it was free the download performed well the mystery of edgar allan poe was informative it ran up to minutes this was a unbox video download it started with the typical intro and ended with the credits some individuals did not get a complete download so i included my experience with the unbox download i hope the review was helpful ty 
the dark side this is one of allen s darker films and immediately any allen fan can tell because of how raw it is allen s films are usually devoid of foul language but this one seems to be cowritten by quentin tarantino needless to say this may be the perfect movie for any person who has enjoyed a woody allen film but who has said that all of his movies are the same the plot is clever a writer makes enemies with everyone he knows because his books are a little too close to fact as dark as this film is i must say that it still is hilarious another brilliant woody allen flick 
the sentinel is still worth watching spoiler alert it is rather hard to review this film without giving away some key components i don t normally include so call spoilers in my reviews but in this case it had a lot to do with the themes of the film this film came out during the glorious era of spiritual horror flicks like the exorcist and the omen and because of the great success of those films this humdinger was sadly overlooked this is truly a horrifying film and deserves a place in your dvd collection especially if you are into this specific genre of spiritual horror flicks the cast is an impressive list of actors who were unfortunately has beens by the s or were up and coming actors who are now rather famous christina raines the main actress sadly never made it big and she should have as she gives a very solid performance in a rather difficult and disturbing film i found the other actors to be good but a bit hammy at times but that doesn t detract from the overall impression of the film in fact it may in a bizarre way add to it considering the casting of actual freaks forgive the political incorrectness of the term in the film this film is like a freak show of sorts or a car accident in of itself we don t really want to see what is on the screen but we can t help ourselves there is enough in this film to revolt some and infuriate many especially in it s condemnation of the sins of man that we try to accept today with our over indulgence of the term tolerance when one sees this odd film one must keep in mind that it is based on the catholic faith s interpretation of sin certainly an instution not well known for it s tolerance of any sin so if you are inclined to do whatever feels good in your life especially to the point of excess you may find yourself squirming in your seat a bit while watching this film either out of an awkward sense of guilt seeing your sins kind of exposed in this film or anger that your way of life isn t considered acceptable by the staunch religious no one likes someone pointing a condemning finger at him or her even when it may be earned our natural instinct is to either feel shame or anger or even a mixture of both by the way i do mean freak show literally when i mentioned it earlier i don t care for that term myself but those in the film considered themselves as such and i grew up in a time and location that had no problem with the term so please excuse my use of it here as i honestly don t mean to be rude there is less make up involved with this film than most are aware of as actual circus freaks were used in the film especially in the climax scene in fact my dad knew a number of them as they were part of the freak show in coney island that famous amusement park in south brooklyn where i spent many a summer day riding the cyclone roller coaster on occasion my dad would take me to some of the bizarre shows in the park and it was interesting to then see those from the shows on film later and be able to say i know that guy for me at a young age when seeing it it added to the oddity of the film my parents were obviously far too permissive in the films they let me see when i was young i saw this film when it came out along with the exorcist and the omen and i was barely in my teens then anyhow i grew up in bensonhurst not too far from where they filmed this movie and i recall taking pictures of the actual house where they filmed the exterior shots i have unfortunately lost them over the years the house and the neighborhood are in the very congested red hook section of brooklyn and despite being directly across the river from bustling manhattan and being in an overcrowded section of brooklyn there is an intense feeling of isolation conveyed in the film much credit for this goes to the director michael winner for achieving this via camera positioning of course he s experienced in shooting in new york having directed the brilliant death wish with charles bronson earlier the whole concept of the film is a bit silly but weirdly interesting in that a lone priest guards the gates of hell until he passes the guardianship over to someone else before his death if he is unable to do so then the gates of hell remain open as they are temporarily left ajar during the transition from one sentinel to the next the idea satan played by burgess meredith comes up with to keep hell s gates open and open wide is to convince the new sentinel to commit suicide a mortal sin in the catholic church and something the main character as attempted once before in her life instead of accepting a thankless life of isolation and servitude as a means of redemption for past sins as silly as the premise is in the film one can t help but to feel both uplifted at the end and sad for the new sentinel for her sacrifice made on behalf of thankless strangers the analogy to christ s crucifixation and life in the priest nunhood is clear here as is the notion of how sinful ugly and sadly self centered suicide can be as viewed by the catholic church and many outside of it please spare me the negative comebacks as this isn t my personal view of suicide i tend to feel that god takes great pity on those who can not face the trials that life often brings and those who attempt or succeed at suicide are often distraught and not thinking clearly i have trouble believing that god would the punish such a troubled soul but that is another discussion argument like the exorcist and the omen before it we are sadden by the losses sustained and the sacrifices made at the end by main characher who may not be totally noble but is certainly likable in the sentinel alison reluctantly takes on the role as the new guardian she wanted so much out of life and already felt that god owed her something hence her suicide attempt earlier yet she still gives to god and others in spite of her past pain one can t help to see how she may be being offered redemption for her past mistakes by taking on this burden but she is allowed the free will to not accept it but she does and although she may do so begrudingly she does it to the salvation of the world in the exorcist father karras does not as misinterpreted by some commit suicide at the end but rather sacrifices himself to save regan the possessed girl he catches the demon between souls so tospeak in the omen peck s character mr thorn is willing to kill his only son to save the world does that sound biblically familiar at all these spiritual horror flicks were popular for a reason and still are because we respect those that are willing to sacrifice themselves selflessly for others even if they don t really want to do it perhaps it s because we may think ourselves incapable of such action or would like to believe we would take the same road as these heroes it matters little in the end what your religious beliefs are or if you have any at all we just can t help being moved by one so noble in nature even if he or she is reluctant to be so consider george bailey in its a wonderful life giving all he or she has for our benefit consider our love and appreciation for soldiers who fight for us and police and firemen who equally risk their lives for us complete strangers and you get my drift i have always enjoyed these kinds of spiritual horror films and when they are well acted written and directed they become classics i am a bit reluctant to label this film a classic but it is still an excellent film that holds up well it didn t define a genre like the others i had mentioned did but it certainly accomplishes what it set out to do it frightens us at the appropriate times grosses us out in others it is very graphic and gets us to see both the worst and best in humankind it may not be a true classic like the exorcist or the omen but it is certainly a solid companion to such films and worth a spot on your shelf 
interesting sleeper the big town doesn t break any cinematic ground but it s more than worth your while how can you go wrong with a film that sports two oscar winners tommy lee jones lee grant and three nominees matt dillon diane lane bruce dern in the cast director ben bolt imbues the film with terrific period atmosphere and the selection of rock rhythm and blues and country and western music is impeccable the film has a gritty sensiblity reminiscent of classic film noir dillon is fine as the kid from indiana with a knack for dice rolling who seeks his fame and fortune in the seedy backrooms of chicago it s jones however who steals the picture in an understated turn as the film s ostensible villain jones doesn t have to say a word just a squint of his eyes and a look at his craggy visage says it all good character turns from vets grant and dern as the couple who bankroll dillon s endeavors the two women in dillon s life lane s exotic dancer and suzy amis aspiring dj are kind of underwritten these two are kind of cliched in representing the good girl bad girl dichotomy the promised showdown between dillon and jones is kind of a fizzle another disappointment is lane s less than erotic fan dance

funny film i bought this movie w o seeing it first which i never do i was glad i did it though my money was not wasted colin firth plays john worthing a wealty man who pretends to be his younger brother earnest when he goes to london the catch is he doesn t have a brother the reason why he does this is because he is smitten with his friend algy severett cousin who wants to marry a man named earnest hence the name as the film goes on worthing finds a way to get rid of earnest by telling those at his country home that earnest had died but before worthing arrives home algy shows up to worthing s house because he falls in love with worthing s young ward cecily pretending to be earnest worthing comes home a day early finds algy and all heck breaks loose ! this is all i am going to say w o spoiling the ending ! you will just have to see it now despite some confusion the film is very funny and it all came together in the end firth and everett did a fantastic job and i would recommend this movie to anyone 
this is the only comedy i like this is a really film you don t have to worry about the acting or the story just have a fun time watching road trip on a friday night with a pal or your lover before i thought this was going to be a silly college buddy film which it is and have barely funny lines i was wrong and i had a hard time trying to calm myself down from laughing too hard at some secens like the boys got in their car and jump over a bridge and then the car broke down and my favorite part was the skinny boy having sex with a big black girl 
incredibly sexy movie with aaaaawesome s soundtrack this is one my absolutely favorite s movies if you love s music then this is for you one of the best soundtracks out there the plot is kind of cheesy but in a really fun way that takes you away from reality it has a very sexual tone to it that makes you want to jump steven bauer he looks totally hot in this movie it s definitley worth watching 
informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
triumphant return to giallo for argento argento s return to giallo in after his two supernatural outings suspiria and inferno was triumphant one by this point argento was so well versed in the sub genres conventions that tenbre has an effortless feel about it the sense that the director was hardly stretching his innumerable talents the film has a nice allegorical feel in its exploration of the effects of violence in the media on people in this case it is not a film but a novel argento is clever to divert attention away from the medium of cinema at the time of the films release just such arguments about violence were reaching an apex especially in the uk where tenebre was actually banned due to its violent content and the influence such imagery might have from a visual perspective argento goes to the extreme opposite of his previous two films by presenting a bright and starkly lit world this brightness is taken to its extremity when one character played by john saxon is stabbed to death in broad daylight the film works well because of a confusing narrative structure which is punctuated by flashbacks which is what one expects from a giallo if it makes sense then arguably it has failed as usual the film is filled with tremendous set pieces including an astonishing sequence where argento shoots a house from every conceivable angle in one take a scene which is disturbing because of the almost omnipotent quality of the gaze of the killer the rome location is evocative and surprising in the rather dour and dreary impression it gives sadly the broader themes of the film are not dealt with in a particularly intelligent and sensitive way and half way through the film argento loses patience and begins despatching cast members with clockwork regularity performances are above average for an italian horror production as is the soundtrack considering the way argento deteriorated as the s became the s tenebre stands as one of the directors better films 
good parady the best part of the film is when the charachter from scream is in his costume getting high for more stuff from the wayans brothers check out in living color 
what a great screenwriting coach this wonderful little book is for you the student of screenwriting how do i know i had the good fortune of being in dr claudia hunter johnson s screenwriting class at florida state university we used the methods described in her book and they work ! if you are disciplined enough to follow her process you will amaze yourself you will begin with le menu your very own personal autobiography and finish with a well crafted script although you will not have her direct feedback you will have the benefit of a script coach who has helped launch a thousand careers tom 
good actors good pilot the show s pilot originally aired back in showing promise for anyone that had a remote interest in horror scifi shows this show had them from the beginning the cast itself worked well with each other and gave some great performances considering most of the action seens required them to visualize most of the things they were fighting the only down side to this pilot is the demise of one of the characters which leads to the introduction of another with her young daughter if this was a stand alone movie it wouldn t be so bad watch the season as it unfolds and the ones that come after it and you ll know she should have been the one to go 
great film my favorite hepburn tracy film not only the acting but the rhythm and pace of the film and the actors i ve seen it many times the story line is simple fun and straight foward about a research department run by three chummy gals and kate hepburn their very smart boss with a photographic memory up to that is all is fine and the first part of the film is very much like watching a play the film moves smoothly along until the gals learn that they re about to get a mechanical brain as they call a new huge computer that makes noises which they fear will replace them and thus their jobs tracy and hepburn are terrific together as usual and there s not a moment lost in this outstanding comedy there is a commentary skip it dina merril who plays one of the secretaries in the flm does most of the talking but she talks mainly about herself and her uninteresting career and practically nothing about the making of the film 
the perils of disconnection suicide club is truly a japanese statement i enjoy japanese films for the interesting glimpse into a psyche strongly influenced by a world of forced detachment and often unfeeling behavior often asian films address the disconnected feeling associated with a fast paced demanding industrialized society suicide club normalizes the emtional pain of suicide into a what the heck fad asian horror often delves into the forbidden viewers eagerly though painfully peek as if watching a train wreck there is a statement i ve never seen an asian film that didn t have one that disconnection resulting from society s demands is paramount in this film the presentation can be compared to the unconventional shocks and cold emptiness of a clockwork orange not for children 
the intersection of film fact and genius unforgettable at its core this is a film about what happens when a person defies the system any system it is the true story of frances farmer a beautiful smart and rebellious movie star of the s who seemed to have it all because of her many advantages the system took a while catching up to her maybe that s where the fury and vengeance originated payback required more than a pound of flesh the system wanted her spirit her intellect and her soul the portrayal of psychiatry as practiced in those days is unlike anything you will see anywhere else it makes cuckoo s nest look like a vacation in tuscany indeed psychiatry in this film is less a healing force than a means of preserving social order and conformity jessica lange deserved the oscar for this role that she didn t get it is a crime this is a solo masterpiece performance easily on a par with streep in sophie s choice lange has the beauty intelligence sophistication and edge to play this complicated woman and she throws herself into the part fearlessly from saucy starlet oozing coy charm to radical intellectual hanging with lefties in nyc to belligerent scrapper knocking heads with studio moguls to star crossed lover inviting disaster and betrayal the way others invite friends over to dinner to self destructive victim descending into the darkness of booze and pills to adult infant manipulated by a fiercely controlling mother to psychiatric patient abused for sport and disassembled lange shifts through facets like she s driving a porsche on a country road you never notice her changing gears every minute of the ride is thrilling the best thing about this film apart from lange is that is shows it doesn t tell the viewer is left to interpret without heavy handed moralizing the truth of frances farmer s life is so fascinating and bizarre that simply bringing it to the screen is more than enough few of us have had the experience of being involuntarily committed to a mental hospital much less lobotomized but all of us have tried to thwart the system at one point or another and paid for it every viewer can applaud farmer s irreverence and idealism even when it s naive and feel sorrow when she must confront the cruel consequences this is a dark movie not all hollywood lives have happy endings but it is a true movie frances takes you places you have never gone and can barely imagine jessica lange delivers the performance of lifetime not just her lifetime anybody s lifetime 
kids love it they have the second movie to this one but love this one just as much was delivered quickly and works perfectly thank you ! 
worth waiting for i had heard of the shop on main street years ago but never had the chance to see it until tonight i even bought and read the book by ladislaw grosman years ago in anticipation of seeing the movie some day i must admit that the book was impressive but not that impressive and so i worried that the movie might be anticlimatical it wasn t the book was a long short story a novella if you will it laid out the story clearly enough but it was the movie that brought all of the characters to life and created the gradual development of the impending crisis by the time we reached that crisis we had met a few jerks and unimpressive characters however we had also come to know and appreciate a number of people that we found endearing for different reasons as events darken the scene we suspect something bad is about to happen i knew what it was going to be but it still had an impact for me the two main characters in the shop on main street are an elderly jewish woman played outstandingly by ida kaminska and a neer dowell slovakian carpenter played impressively by josef kraner the way these two come to interact with each other and the ebb and flo of their relationship is the heart of the movie the picture gives a personal look at the final solution as it is played out in a small czech village the emotions that the director brings out on film is where the movie soars above the book watching the shop on main street is a moving experience it challenges us and leaves us wondering where we would have fit into this cast of characters in doing so we may come to have a slightly better understanding of the incomprehensible that oxymoron is worth the two hours spent watching the shop on main street the raw emotions on display will stay with you long after

simply an enjoyable show this isn t the type of movie that will make you reflect and question your life s ambitions it s designed to make you laugh i think it succeeds admirably molly ringwald is perfect as the budding teenager ready to have life meet her full force she is surrounded by a quirky forgetful family complete with a jerk for a younger brother nerdy boys desperate for her attention good friends with whom she can be herself and naturally a love interest anthony michael hall s character is as funny a dorky kid as i ve ever seen his dance moves are legendary ! he has several monologues that still bring out genuine laughs from me even after all these years of watching this classic this is a teen movie so go in with your expectations at that level and you may be pleasantly surprised that you enjoy watching this movie for years to come 
brilliant acting by roth and ormond i stumbled upon this video very late one night about two weeks ago quite by accident i was drawn in immediately and held absolutely spellbound by the performances of both tim roth and julia ormond since then i have purchased the video and rewatched it more times than i can count each time loving the movie more this is a love story against all odds a tender heart wrenching passionate love story of two people drawn together by lonliness need and desire i agree with one reviewer who said this was one of the most erotically charged films ever seen i have never seen roth portray this kind of character and i must say i have become an avid fan and only hope he will take on more roles of this nature his performance was riveting i e tender sensitive poignant and very human i certainly don t mean to downplay ormond s performance it was superb as well the chemistry between the actors was incredibly real both of whom conveyed so much feeling through their eyes facial expressions and body language since discovering this gem i have read a lot of the reviews and i totally disagree with one movie critic who said roth was miscast in the part the fact that he does not look like brad pitt makes it even more believeable for me roth may not be handsome in the classic sense but he has a unique look very sexy intense charismatic and sensual this movie touches me deeply i only wish that the ending had not been so rushed i would love to see this movie make it to dvd 
a classic offbeat western this is one of my all time favorite western movies i recommend it to paul newman fans and western fans notable for first appearance of victoria principal 
nag nag nag this isn t one of the dirty harry series but it might as well be clint eastwood plays a tough phoenix cop who s been around a long time and has become jaded most of the other cops regard him as a drunk when he is sent to las vegas to bring back a prisoner who is to be a witness in a mob trial he thinks it is just another detail nobody wants it seems like nothing out of the ordinary until he actually tries to pick up the prisoner she is a small time hooker but she goes berserk she says that if she leaves las vegas she will be killed the casinos are even taking bets on her not making it survival is a longshot eastwood doesn t buy it at first but a few stray bullets and bombs convince him otherwise he realizes that he got the assignment because he was not expected to make it and that he is being set up by someone in his own department that more than anything else convinces him to make it and get his prisoner delivered alive getting there means running a gauntlet of betrayal and lots of bullets it also means he has to deal with the girl played by sondra locke as he is fond of saying all she can do is nag nag nag it an action packed movie that is well suited to eastwood s style 
best picture absolutely this film represents the end of a time when witty dialogand insightful writing had a chance to make it to the bigscreen even though there s an unmistakeable feeling ofwatching a play on film the crispness of the dialog and thetight editing make you yearn for a return of intelligence tothe movies bette davis is superb as the magnificently self absorbed starof broadway and anne baxter underplays the role of eve theviscious starlet on her way up marilyn monroe as the vapidbeauty and george sander who won the oscar for best supportingactor are delightful celeste holm does a wonderful subtle lowkey job as the self effacing playwright s wife the image and sound quality on this dvd are excellent and it seasy to see why it won the oscar for best picture lynn hoffman author of the new short course in wine andthe novel bang bang isbn 
the best american movie on interracial romance period after writing my review on something new people are going to assume i hate ir unions when that simply is not the case i like a great film that explores more than just the surface on ir unions the producers female actors and director of something new were so arrogant promting the movie like their movie was going to change the paradigm of ir amongst black women well years ago i saw and happen to own the best american and most realistic movie on the subject of mixed relationships that explores the race class regional multicultural issues of romance it is mississippi masala mira nair who has directed other classics shot this work of art in starring denzel washington joe senca charles s dutton mohan agashe and sarita choudhury in this multi layered film that explores all those themes in a realistic setting the film is stunning in the price each charcter plays in their pursuit of some sort of redemption in their lives race in the south is at the forefront but so is class ethnic and racial politics and ultimately love in a film that at least explores other types of mixed relationships that i think is the key to finding at least racial co existence in this country nair has created a work of art that will open your heart long after the film ends this is the film that the makers of something new could not have made because of their arrogance 
the eiger sanction i like this eastwood movie i always found myself watching it when it came on tv so i bought it 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
a memory of years comes to life i first saw this film when i was thirteen perhaps even younger as i recall seeing it in black and white thirty years on propelled by memories which still stuck in my mind i bought this disk from america it is not released in the uk where i live seeing again through adult eyes one notices the joins the songs which do not really work the occasional twee touch but what a film ! presented in marvellous technicolour with a cast which takes the script seriously and does not go over the top unnecessarily thus bringing dr seuss s amazing freudian dreamfantasy to life this is not an epic it is an intimate film which talks to you rather than throwing endless special effects at you to stave off your boredom its also nothing like the recent live action the cat in the hat which some consider the worst film ever it reminds us of the gulf between adults and children and dr seuss reminds us that sometimes adults have to see through children s eyes to see the truth but it also lets the adults have their say as well this is ultimately a film of its time the early s but it s a film which takes its chances and doesn t play safe it s a film which is strange dreamlike and worth taking to your heart thirty years on i m glad i did why not try it you might too 
the dark knight as campy as ever the film adaptation of the hit abc series of the s has it all action danger romance and comedy ! adam west and burt ward were at their best as batman and robin lee meriwether was just as sexy as the catwoman than julie newmar who was unable to appear in the film to to a prior commitment and cesar romero burgess meridith and frank gorshin was hilariously excellent as the villains the special features in the dvd has a mini documentary featuring adam and burt talking about their days on the set of the batman movie and there s also a tour of the batmobile as told by the man who made it possible george barris i love this film i have not seen it in years it may not be the tv series that we wished for but it is close enough 
great flick but i loved this movie when it was shown on amc one time so i finally ordered this movie and found it not to be closed captioned great flick but kinda hard to follow know what i m saying it was advertised in amazon com that it was closed captioned and it wasn t so i had to send it back if it ever comes in cc or better yet on dvd let me know 
very good i found this video very enjoyable i had seen most of these cartoons before on t v but only the butchered versions that the censors felt were appropriate for you and i to see i highly recommend this video if you wish to see tex avery s work as it was originally intended not to mention that these are some of the most hilarious cartoons ever made anyway 
boys town i have seen this movie in the past on tv and am familiar with the story line i have also been to visit boys town since i have family in omaha nebraska i would say if anyone is considering buying this movie do spencer tracy makes a good father flanigan the priest who starts up boys town in this movie and micky rooney who plays a hoddlem 
good family movie awesome to watch with all age groups funny with enough to keep parents laughing and enjoying as well as small children to teenagers

an underrated film this is one of the most underrated war or anti war films of all time the story is a familiar one a group of american and german soldiers call their own unauthorized truce during the holidays and learn that the enemy isn t such an enemy after all the original took place in wwi this one is updated to wwii paul mccartney even used the storyline in an early music video tug of war i think but never has the story been told so eloquently and beautifully as in this film if you re looking for an inspirational movie for the holidays one that doesn t involve santa claus angels or ebenezer scrooge you should definitely consider a midnight clear 
a good idea how heaven looks like but i don t beleave in re encarnation 
very good movie it s very cool in my honest opinion and very good action and special effects ! and the very hot mario van peebles makes it awesome ! 
love it i did this video faithfully for weeks until my pregnant belly wouldn t let me do push ups anymore but my arms improved so much it really was amazing i can t wait until my baby is born so that i can do this video as well as the legs and buns and the abs video which i also own it s so encouraging that i only have to work out minutes each time and will be seeing results ! it s amazing i recommend this video very highly you will need one set of lb weights and one set of lb weights though just so you know but it works ! oh and denise s voice does not bother me at all i think she sounds really sweet i say that because some other reviewers said they didn t like it great video 
unforgettable this has always been one of my alltime cinema favorites and i was happy to see it available on dvd the story the script the direction and the acting are superb

beautiful incredible scenery wonderful depiction of michner s historic epic must for your classic cd collection 
i suppose it should be possible to find a film as beautiful it s funny that a critic from the new york times could know so little about film i will not say much except this is one of the most simple most beautiful stories made into cinema there is absolutely no artifice no tricks and every detail is pure and genuine tony uses faces kurasawa could ve killed for you ain t seen nothing if you ain t seen this the music artists like gritos de guerra la caita sheik al tuni seemingly unavailable on record but better than anything i ve heard seems to capture at once the joy and sorrow bound up in human life likewise the players most not actors in fact the music is so integrated into the lives of the characters in the end there is no division for reviewers of respected periodicals we would explain this is what is called thematic so much for the standards of education in journalism even reviewers who really liked this movie did not fully understand this like most really great art it is ahead of the curve i suppose it should be possible to find a film as beautiful as this as simple and captivating but none come to mind skip vengo and your life will certainly be less rich 
a really cool movie that fans will enjoy this movie has always ranked high as one of my personal favorites in the series the d scenes may look cheesy without d but the story is just as cool as the original there are many memorable parts of the movie that i have always loved for many years especially all of the scenes that were about the biker gang the character shelly has always been one of my favorite characters in the series because i can sadly relate to the guy a little too much this is also the movie of which jason finally gets his mask ! so with everything this is a really cool movie and a historical one if for no other reason than this is jason s hockey mask debut ! 
nice and awesome i absolutely love atlantis from ronon dex to sheppard and to all the faces i d cry if atlantis was cancelled seriously though steve should have never have died he should also have been put in command of sg can you imagine that why steve welcome to earth youre welcome to live out your life if you only feed in self defense on enemies kay oh you re also in charge of sg p but seriously the wraith make this show so awesome from steve to bob to edward to gordon and alexander to michael and eric by far james s best performance yet the wraith make this show what it is but one thing why don t we have before i sleep seriously you have no idea how irked i am at that since i began watching in s anyways i think atlantis totally pwns sg 
amazing i m the biggest fan of this movie in the whole world theres nothing like this film great actors i love the maniac performed by freddie jones and the explosives squad too with a wonderful incredibleawesomeunforgettable richard harris as the head of the team without disregarding the likes of anthony hopkins omar sheriff ian holm juggernaut i ll never forget you ill live forever in the britannic and i could swear i m listening the explosions is it the blue wire or the red one i want that dvd now ! 
bite me yes it s over thetop yes it s gorey and heretical but this only adds to the movie s drawing power both hugh grant and amanda donohoe are absolutely terrific in their performances darncan she be so scary and still so sexy as in the scene where upon hearing a recording of a snake charmers music she emerges from her wicker basket and sexily slithers across the room and out of the house dressed in skin tight black leather how else would a snake wear it s skin another impressionable scene occurs when the lovely catherine oxenberg is ready to be fed to the white worm the poor victim is hanging by her wrists over the lair and the half serpentine donohoe nude and painted blue doning yellow snake eyes is summoning up the serpent if you re uptight or prudish see something else but if you enjoy a good campy scare with some gore and sexy imagery don t miss this one 
better than expected from the reviews i thought the acting in this movie was very well done the people in the movie seemed very real not the over done i am in charge no matter what if you like it or not type of acting usually found in this type of film some posters have said that the movie was not true to life i would guess in a way it was not but does it really matter in a work of fiction 
still scary after all these years no other attempt has been made to date to rework redo this story i believe with today s special effects it could be even scarier than this one but this one still chills ! for what hollywood had to work with i think they did a memorable and timeless job of founding a new creature to haunt your nightmares this movie really scared me as a child watching chiller theater every time it was on i watched only to be scared again ! i hadn t seen it in over years then just recently i purchased the universal collection and watched it again as an adult and having seen the progress with special effects i wasn t as scared except the scene where the creature is swimming below the token female in the lagoon really creepy never mind the rubber suit all in all still a good little chiller and worth owning in the new collection with the other creature movies 
should we mess with movies ever since the colorizing debate of a generation ago this question has been asked over and over again and we ve finally settled it i hope this dvd gives the viewer options of seeing it in the way it was originally released or with the ending created by its maker like everybody else i d only seen the chopped version labelled by some here as surreal well there were plenty of other surreal elements throughout the original most epsecially the surreal premise that ralph meeker was an actor however i would urge even the purists among you to take a very very close look at the intended ending it adds so much to what came before and helps us understand the childlike attitudes we had towards this weaponry we d just been the first to use in the name of world peace this new era was far from innicent but we were like children with the power we had a great film now made even better for history 
great horror flick april fool s day is a great horror flick from the decade that bought us wild hair thats right the s the movie is about a bunch of kids go to this island to visit their friend muffy needless to say one by one someone is killing the kids off the movie is fun and has a fun cast to go with including amy steele 
john ford henry fonda john wayne craft excellent western the st and best of the calvary trilogy fonda plays a small minded embittered rascist classist dishonorable incompentent pendantic martinet wayne in a subordinant role plays his loyal but wary second incommand from the very beginning ford s col thursday gets off on the wrong foot rude unprofessional and openly disdainful he alienates everyone on his new post especially and purhaps most importantly the women his ceaseless disrespect offends the wives and infuriates their husbands nobody likes to see their wife disrespected particularly by a senior officer who should know better fort apache is a wonderful examination of military mens devotion to duty even when commanded by those unfit to command 
hilarious martin lawrence is one crazy man anything he is or will be in is worth watching 
jenny wright and adrian pasdar heat up the screen put simply this is the most sensual portrayal of the vampire myth in recent cinematic history and it does a neat turnaround of the roles since most renditions have a sweet innocent young woman seduced by a dark handsome bloodsucker instead jenny wright is the ethereally beautiful seductive mysterious stranger who initiates adrian pasdar as farm boy caleb colton whose openly displayed lust is kind of amusing for a minute there into the mysteries of her night focused world watch her during the scenes in which she bites caleb and later kills for him jenny wright certainly never reached the caliber of meryl streep during her short career but she could act her performance as mae in near dark was chilling and admirable caleb is on a sort of probationary vampire status and he finds it impossible to kill which is a requirement since according to mae the night has its price and yes the end is probably not what the readers of fangoria would have preferred although they probably would ve bailed on this anyway once they learned the only real gore was in the bar room scene terrific supporting cast especially bill paxton who stole every scene he was in but the scenes with just wright and pasdar oooh powerful sexy and unforgettable not to be missed 
i love the movie the spice girls are the best and if you are a spice fan than this is the movie for you i love i 
woody s first great movie allen s talent grew in leaps and bounds in the late s and early s sleeper was only his fifth directorial effort and is still considered one of his best personally my favorite pure comedy of allen s entire career in sleeper he best combines stand up material with physical comedy to make hilarious and biting social satire only allen would compliment albeit sardonically the nazi s for their single positive contribution to society the volkswagon bug the third reich may not have lasted longer than fifteen years but that s a great little car along the way he lampoons everything from repressive orwellian societies to sex toys a great starting point for newcomers to woody allen films 
beautifully sad with echoes of europa europa greetings comrades i have rented this video several times from my public library and have always enjoyed it it reminds me of the similarly themed europa europa as well as burnt by the sun the film covers a lot of plot lines and a long slice of time rather like a miniseries but it is nowhere near as dull and plodding as other wwii films such as sunshine if you liked est ouest eastwest europa europa the third miracle the cold room or the work of krzysztof kieslowski you will at the least enjoy red cherry i have watched hundreds of wwii movies from documentaries to fictionalized histories to pure fiction and red cherry is certainly more intriguing and involving than the majority of wwii works available as a multilingual linguaphile i especially liked the use of local languages and therefore english subtitles it always seems faintly dorky to me to have everyone speaking english with a russian or german accent in wwii movies if you do not like subtitles then this movie may drive you crazy however if you want a fresh take on world war ii from the point of view of orphaned chinese children this movie is just the ticket dosvidanya tovarishi 
these guys are talented i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit 
the river this is a masterpiece by jean renoir the river is the life itself with its contradictions it deals with life and death the problems of being a teenager and the condition of belonging to different cultures at the same time 
as scary as it was so many years ago this movie is a great example of movie making at its finest the eerie atmosphere makes dialogue unecessary and the creepy black and white tones complement this as well note many versions of this movie are available many which include minutes of more film the alpha film versions states it ontains or so minutes but the case claims only 
do not miss this this is one of the sexiest movies of all time ! pre dating the italian neo realist wave of film making by just a couple of years its influence can be felt in the the movies of film makers such as disica and rossellini 
i enjoyed it for what it was ! entertainment yup ! just bought it for a chance to see some other kiefer sutherland movie he does hold the movie together and i am always interested in michael gross from tremors he did play an excellent by the book nerd and who could pass up the scene where winkler pull the goose or was it a duck out i generally have no use for the ultimate head boss who makes decisions without being aware of the chaos they generate then there was leonard mister know it all yet they all worked together to make a movie of entertainment even if the actual facts were blurred as to true life you had to feel the same sorrow that the emotionally wounded jack harris felt at the lose of the hundred and some souls humanity is what it is all about not numbers can a plane actually be landed that way this dvd was well worth the price don t let others color what your opinion is of what you enjoy just see for yourself definitely recommend for sutherland alone 
great cast great script great movie a solid script backed up by a great cast john cusack ray liotta john c mcginley alfred molina amanda peet and more are all outstanding brilliantly directed by james mangold who also directed copland girl intrerupted and walk the line this is one of the best thrillers i have ever seen to say too much about the script would possibly give it away but in the style of the agatha christie s novels ten little indians and murder on the orient express where people start dying in suspicious circumstances and later they find out they are all connected in some way in this movie we have ten complete strangers stranded at a desert motel for the night sure enough people start getting killed there is a lot of finger pointing and plenty of twists along the way to keep the audience engaged the music score is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the whole movie special features include bonus trailers an on the set documentary and very informative and interesting commentaries one by the director and one by the writer the latter being the better of the two the disc features both cinema and dvd versions although the dvd version only includes extra scenes that last no longer than seconds each the only fault i have of the movie is that it seems too much time was spent in the first half of the movie bringing the characters together and laying a foundation forcing the ending to seem rushed through to conclude the movie within the minutes instead of the film being possibly edited longer all up though one of the best thrillers you will ever see i have seen it many times and it is still good even when you know the ending 
an underrated gem this underrated highly entertaining satire boasts memorable performances clever camera angles and a spirited production design look for a red headed scene stealing douglas spain walkout band of brothers resurrection blvd as one of gone withthegays true directions misfits his climactic tearful speech is both touching and hilarious pop the corn kick back and treat yourself to this delightful romp 
oh my sweet goodness an irresistibly irresistible comedy green card is a must must must one man is foreign and wants a green card to get into the united states and a woman wants to become a landlady but must marry first so what do they do to get what they want they marry then fall in love you ll howl with laughter and literally pummel your fists to death with this movie because green card is the irresistibly irresistible comedy 
haunting tragicintense i remember seeing this film years ago on i think masterpiece theatre and wondering at ralph fienne s hypnotic erotic passionate portrayal of the tortured manipulative vindictive heathcliff last night i found myself watching bits of it on youtube and fell in love all over again impulsive girl that i am i immediately came here to amazon and bought the dvd to me there is no finer character in literature than heathcliff and there is no more powerful study of the devastating effects of romantic love than wuthering heights this film does justice to both 
yellowbeard an under rated film yellowbeard is a pirate film with a monty python feel good film 
mr zacharias clearly shows the problems of post modernism in this book ravi zacharias clearly unfolds the problems post modernism has with the concept of evil in an age of increased intellectualism man not only has not only illustrated his inability to create utopia but has in fact come to the brink of self destruction mr zacharias traces this to the extinction of known truth which no society can live without well thought out and well written i recommend this book to any thinker religious agnostic or other 
underrated gem with a bonus this film is light and fun well acted and knows what it is a film that doesn t take itself seriously yet does present a convincing love story in a beautiful setting with a fun take on an historical figure and i might only give it stars but it gets the extra star for showcasing the beauty of new jersey my home state gets a bad rap and this film shows just how lovely much of the state truly is while it s meant to take place in the s the scenery is still there and still beautiful oh and one other thing that makes it a five as a man this is one of those chick films that i ll gladly watch with my girlfriend it s meg ryan at her cutest and tim robbins is weird enough looking that i look pretty good in comparison this movie helps perpetuate the myth that goofy looking guys without much to offer can attract smart attractive women and hey what s wrong with that 
a chorus line this was a great movie for me because my daughter did this dance routine in a school production years ago and we both wanted to see the movie over and over again 
teen witch i loved this movie when i was a teenager and i still love it today ! i love the music it will have you singing them too ! it s a fun movie ! a good movie that anyone can watch again and again ! this makes a great slumber party movie i think it teaches a lesson too that we all deal with trying to fit in wanting to be loved and accepted to learning how to just be yourself i highly recommend ! it has comedy romance drama music dancing its a great pick ! 
hrm well it is always a mistake to read the book before seeing the movie that said i liked the movie ok taken by itself but compared to the book it is pretty vanilla they moved the action from new york city to chicago for some unknown reason and got rid of two of the best characters pendergast and smithback also i was repeatedly annoyed by the lighting or lack thereof while watching this it seems that about half of the movie you spend straining to see what is going on in all the shadows and the other half you re rubbing your eyes because they are shining bright lights directly into the camera ouchaside from that i liked the monster effects and i liked that they actually let us see the monster so many monster movies never give you a good look at what is running about i suppose because they don t want to be bothered actually creating the whole thing but this one had a great monster and the pacing was good as well i wanted to smack around some of the annoying rich people but i guess that was the point if you like monster movies and haven t read the book yet watch the movie first if you read the book first you won t enjoy the movie as much once you ve watched the movie read the book cause it rocks 
a poignant masterpiece there are very few films that have literally brought tears to my eyes they must be films of uncompromising emotional power films like magnolia the passion of the christ and now johnny belinda it is the story of a deaf and dumb young woman named belinda treated as an unintelligent workhorse all her years belinda s life changes forever when a lonely new doctor moves into her small coastal nova scotian port town he takes an immediate liking to her and proving to her family that she is not the dummy they think he teaches her to read lips but after a drunken sexual assault leaves her pregnant rumors begin to fly throughout the small town and both belinda and her loved ones must fight for what s right the performances are wonderful of course jane wyman simply steals the show in her oscar winning performance she brings an incredible heart warmth and emotional resonance to the character of belinda and she does it without ever saying a word the rest of the cast is marvelous as well especially charles bickford who lovingly portrays belinda s father and stephen mcnally who turns belinda s attacker into one of the most easy to loathe characters ever put on celluloid yet the film still brilliantly keeps him at the level of a realistic personality no one is a caricature director jean negulesco brings an understated visual beauty to the film reminiscent of the silent ages when one had to use aesthetics to make up for the lack of aural stimulus every shot is a perfectly composed work of art turning every moment of belinda into a masterwork of lighting and raw majestic nature the seaside settings are utilized so well that they put johnny belinda in league with such legendary jaw droppers as l avventura and black narcissus but this film is much more than just visual appeal it is both heartwarming and heartbreaking often simultaneously there are so many thought provoking themes to gnaw on in johnny belinda the way people view the handicapped the bonds of parenthood the power of rumors the justification of violence as self defense and overall morality and humanity even the film s setting could be considered an allegory on belinda the brutal waves of the ocean constantly pounding against the serene shores the film is also as i mentioned before emotionally overwhelming while it certainly has a focused narrative belinda is foremost a progression of feelings and they are so well conveyed that i was simply overcome with joy pain heartbreak and hope while the film is often described as a melodrama it is far from a soap opera there are no miraculous moments of sudden verbal triumph for belinda no ridiculously overacted moments of teary eyed abandon johnny belinda is a terribly real experience there are aspects of the story that remain unresolved not loose ends but difficult problems that would most likely also remain unresolved in reality however i don t want to give the impression that johnny belinda is depressing i felt uplifted and rapturous just as often as i felt overcome by grief and fear i felt so much for these characters and i wanted so sorely for things to turn out a certain way but i won t reveal whether they do or not i will say that the film ends on a note of nearly unbearable poignancy and this is the moment that massaged my tear ducts my only complaint concerning the film is max steiner s score he is perfectly suited for epic films like king kong and gone with the wind but here it feels somewhat overdramatic and occasionally awkward he tends to play up the melodramatic angle and spot score in a ubiquitous manner which simply doesn t fit with a film like johnny belinda still it tends to work more often than not and it is not a major enough problem to work seriously to the film s detriment this picture is a true gem it has been unavailable for years but thanks to warner brothers it finally has a dvd release and the restoration is simply glorious it more than does justice to this cinematic treasure do yourself a favor and see johnny belinda 
the best baseball movie ever made and perhaps the best movie period is quotpastimequot a perfect blend of character study and morality play both a slice oflife and larger thanlife view of minor league ball in the late s and a portrait of a protagonist worthy of anyone s admiration the casting and acting particularly of william russ in the main role and noble willingham as the manager are superb all the other elements of the film its reality its values its script many choice and insightful lines its cinematography its music particularly quotswing low quot its attention to detail its real star cameos engage both the mind and the heart the only reason i can see why it has not received more notice is a lack of marketing and big name stars quotcapraesquequot in the best sense it puts to shame quotmajor league quot and would be mythic silliness as quotthe natural quot clay eal 
hot view of the fall of imperialism gibson and weaver star in theis steamy view of the fall of imperialism in indonesia they start living the expat life in jakarta and live the transformation as the country moves to military rule the movie is interesting on many fronts seeing the leads before they became megastars watching the subtle condemnation of expats amongst locals and the history woven into the fiction supporting roles are played superbly as well it s a great movie 
beautiful people don t always do beautiful things the people are beautiful especially the female leads their childhood years were acted by two lovely coltish teenagers who only hint at how gorgeous the adult women will be low caste maya adds training to beauty in becoming a courtesan with men her life for her pleasure as well as men in her life for their own pleasure high born maya s looks seduce a king into marrying her the years in front of each one promise happiness even a chance at love their own jealousies combined with jealousies around them break that promise maya resents tara s wealth tara envies maya s grace and allure and so on until utter collapse in the end only maya seems to escape unharmed she starts life with nearly nothing and in the end walks into exile with neary nothing just the clothes on her back but in between she gains a wealth of knowledge and memory that can never be taken away intimate encounters vary as they do in real life the finest are warm gentle enticing expressions physical love with real feeling enhanced by training in the skills of love the worst come from a terrible mismatch of wedding night expectations maya s virginal fear against his animal urges and belief in a skilled seductress a failure that contaminates their feelings forever the story of loves gained lost and stillborn will appeal to some viewers for me the simple beauty of the actors and the scenes around them is enough wiredweir 
memphis belle one of my favorite movies particularly if you re a wwii buff i watch it at least once a year 
a dysfunctional woody allen prior to therapy i think woody allen is the best director currently in the business and i believe his serious themed movies are the reason he excells at making us look at ourselves if i m not mistaken interiors was his first venture into dramatic movies for having led the way this movie is noteworthy however it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the woody allen movie it defines the woody allen film by showing us what it is not woody allen s greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves his characters have faults that we share whatever passions that we have fallen prey to we see them in a new light through allen s masterful script and direction the problem with interiors is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in interiors have many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by ingar bergman allen s own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it taken in its own right interiors is an above average movie the acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner the movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess these people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other woody allen cast with the bumbling exception of the cast of whats new pussycat woody allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way fortunately he learned from his experience 
great underrated classic its so sad that this movie didn t do better at the box office and more people don t know about it like most people say here it should be a regular holiday classic despite the langauge which can be cleaned up for the kids and granny ive seen it times and i love it more and more each time if you haven t seen it you need to buy it you won t be dissapointed 
who didnt get choked up when powder shows a father and son how to put away their differences remember how much they really loved each other and helped them come together as father and son seeing the two embracing powder cant help but to hold onto a pole with tears running down his face wishing it were him and his father powder allows us to use him and abuse him just as he says how long do you think i will allow you to keep me here its knowing that he can leave anytime he chooses but stays behind because he so loves the human race that powder takes the abuse just for the chance of contact with another being as special as he is he sees us as the greatest living force in the universe while we see each other as evil and useless this movie if seen with an open mind can teach us all something that we may never fully accept 
an under appreciated classic this is without doubt one of the finest christmas flicks ever made cary grant just does cary grant sooooo well i highly recommend this movie once you have watched grinch and elve too many times this will help you get back into the true holiday spirit 
funny funnyfunny even though this is about years old it is extremely halarious i ve been waiting to see a good stand up comedy the first min is just one hilarious hit after another i love this guy 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
very good movie about medical students very well taken movie that depicts the sacrifices and passion required for medical profession background score goes very well with the movie 
when the did we get ice cream the ringer is the kind of movie where upon a quick glance most people would assume is made strictly to shock and offend considering the infamous farrelly brothers theres something about mary me myself irene stand by as producers one could imagine the many cheap shots this movie would take surprisingly though it doesn t and despite the restrictions the movie gives itself it s quite funny at times and despite a somewhat predictable plot it s actually a bit heartwarming and sentimental apparently i m in the minority of people who actually enjoyed this movie then again i tried not to keep my expectations up too high for starters this isn t exactly a farrelly brothers movie so don t go in expecting that type of humor sure it shows up at times but the ringer is more conventional than those movies johnny knoxville from jackass is perfect as steve a reluctant participant in the special olympics coerced by his uncle gary played by brian cox manhunter red eye steve is forced into the games in part to pay off his uncle s bookies but also to be able to afford surgery to replace the three severed fingers of the man he hired to mow his lawn the plot does get a bit ridiculous at points and you can see steve s happy ending with lynn katherine heigl of bride of chucky a volunteer at the olympics coming miles away but despite all that the movie does a good job carrying a message without being condescending or losing it s sense of humor if you look at the cover of the dvd or read any reviews and feel the urge to be instantly offended don t the ringer is quite well done and actually features many mentally disabled actors in prominent roles and if that s not enough for you it s also flat out funny it s simply a good comedy with a decent story and an interesting and original angle just don t take it too seriously 
v for vendetta great flick with plenty of special effects and great audio and it even has the semblance of a plot politicians watch out 
one of my favorites of all caper movies based on the book and directed by michael crichton this enjoyable caper movie from brings together a fantastic cast in an authentic th century victorian environment to tell a story based around the true story of the first great train robbery i saw this movie many years ago on british television and have always found it enjoyable so it was an easy buy for me in addition to a superb sean connery as the suave mastermind edward pierce is connery ever not suave and the always amazing donald sutherland as his accomplice agar we also have lesley anne down as miriam down was a favorite actress of mine from this era with movies like the pink panther strikes again rough cut and sphinx here she plays connery s lover who is not afraid to use her quite incredible feminine charms to aid pierce character joining the three leads are such well known faces as british television celebrity michael elphick as the railway guard who aids pierce and agar pamela salem as emily trent salem would be reunited with connery four years later in the rogue film never say never again and alan webb as the bank president filmed in ireland with a modest budget of only million the script is intelligent the action appropriate and the dialogue both witty and engaging the showpiece stunt with pierce on top of a moving train has since been copied many times since including in the james bond movie octopussy with roger moore in the role that sean connery made famous but this stunt sequence is distinctive in that connery performed his own stunts the train was supposed to be traveling only miles perhour but connery argued that the train was actually moving much faster an assertion that was confirmed by the helicopter pilot who measured the speed of the train at miles perhourthe movie set in tells the story of the three conspirators attempts to steal million in gold bullion that is being transported by train to pay british troops fighting in the crimean war to gain access to the gold pierce and agar need copies to four keys and the bulk of the movie involves their efforts to obtain each key in what can be described as four separate caper tales the effort and difficulties facing the thieves is ably outlined by connery in the opening narration to the movie in the year england and france were at war with russia in the crimea the english troops were paid in gold once a month twenty five thousand pounds in gold was loaded into strongboxes inside the london bank of huddleston and bradford and taken by trusted armed guards to the railway station the convoy followed no fixed route or timetable at the station the gold was loaded into the luggage van of the folkestone train for shipment to the coast and from there to the crimea the strongboxes were placed into two specially built chubb safes constructed of three quarter inch tempered steel each safe weighed five hundred and fifty pounds each safe was fitted with two locks requiring two keys or four keys altogether for security each key was individually protected two keys were entrusted to the railway dispatcher who kept them locked in his office a third was in the custody of mr edgar trent president of the huddleston and bradford and the fourth key was given to mr henry fowler manager of the huddleston and bradford the presence of so much gold in one place naturally aroused the interest of the english criminal elements but in there had never been a robbery from a moving railway train there are some definite differences between the actual robbery on which crichton based his work and the movie the actual plot involved four criminals pierce agar the railway guard burgess and a railway clerk named tester and all four keys were kept on railroad premises in london and folkestone but as it turned out the two foilkestone keys were not used in addition the guard s van was not locked from the outside pierce and agar were let in by burgess and a share of the loot was handed out to tester at stations the crown jewel as far as supplementary material is concerned is the scene specific commentary by writer director crichton even given the intervening years between the release of the movie and the recording of the commentary crichton seems to have a wealth of anecdotal and technical recollections of the making of the movie and displays a genuine affection for the movie we learn about the research he did for the book and the machinations that went on behind the scenes apparently the largely british and irish crew initially had little respect for the young director until he ordered a copy of his movie coma for them to watch after which he got more respect in another incident crichton s hair caught on fire when the locomotive emitted burning embers there is also as was common for mgm releases in the earlu days of dvd an page glossy full color booklet with trivia surrounding the making of the movie 
life is its own reward i read the book many years before seeing the movie both are testimonies of the mystery of the human spirit the wonder and love of life and the ugliness of human hatred 
an excellent movie jack lemon gives a memorable great performance this movie also shows how the disease of alcoholism takes over and affects not only the drinker but his family and friends it also shows how aa can help running the movie with blake edwards commentary is interesting as well blake and jack talked about their own issues with drinking and how thought provoking the movie was for them if you love jack lemon or want to know more about alcoholism this is probably one of the best movies to watch 
heres rule number one you better not squirt skipped parts takes place in it is narrated by sam bug hall a seventh grader and aspiring writer he doesn t know who his father is because his mother lydia jennifer jason leigh is a promiscuous lush sam s grandfather sends them away with his financial support so he won t be embarrassed by her when he runs for governor of south carolina they end up in wyoming where sam meets maurey mischa barton during a school baseball game they argue about mark twain in class shortly after maurey and her mom peggy lipton do a neighborly visit the welcome wagon lydia is embarrassingly rude to them later sam tells his mom he thinks he s in love with maurey cuz he can t stand her sam gets teased and hassled by girls in school and also by maurey s boyfriend dothan brad renfro on november kennedy is shot maurey is very upset and cries and sam consoles her dothan makes some racist remarks and maurey and sam go to her house in another fantasy sam kisses maurey s mom he has a resulting nocturnal emission and shows his mom later sam tells maurey about it at the soda shop and she talks to a waitress about sex maurey later shows up to make sex with sam as a learning experience they try but fail in a funny scene later lydia gives them a sex talk and advice maurey inevitably gets pregnant and after some initial reluctance sam seems happy as a father the movie is well acted by all there is quite a bit of humor too the movie is r rated for language which includes frank sexual talk and sexual content however the sex scenes involving sam and maurey are tame and mostly set up by the dialog which is quite funny this is probably mischa s best movie after lawn dogs drew barrymore has a small part in sam s fantasies the movie only skims the book which has more sex related and bodypart related dialog the dvd has a good commentary by director tamra davis and a trailer

one of my favorite disney channel original movies this movie was very good ! the actors played their parts well and the story is entertaining from beginning to end it almost makes you want to get into motocross racing ! there was friendship romance and of course motocross in this well thought out and family friendly movie all the characters were enjoyable and easy to relate to alana austin was especially good as andrea the main character overall i would say this was a great movie ! but i would rather wait for it to come on disney channel then buy it 
the best you know the story probably the best and most timeless christmas movie ever all the characters are gems especially darrin mcgavin as the old man one of the channels we have shows this for hours straight from christmas eve thru christmas day true classic 
the other side of midnight in my opinion one of sidney sheldon s very best stories excellent movie need to pay close attention to some events in movie i e dinner party where marie france leaves table to go onto veranda as it has chilling impact towards end of film incredible scenery along with fantastic cast with one exception s s have waited quite a while for this to be available on dvd as have been watching my vhs copy at least once a year and do not become bored no matter how many times i watch you won t be sorry for purchase even though it is an older movie 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
visually stunning i m a non skier and i found the photography beautiful the skier in the family loved seeing the different mountains around the world and loved the element of danger 
on the town this exhilarating musical comedy featuring respectively the fancy footwork and infectious crooning of gis kelly and sinatra perfectly captures the optimistic spirit that held sway in the post world war ii boom co starring dancers vera ellen and ann miller on the town was one of the first color films shot on location in manhattan and remains one of the grandest liveliest hollywood musicals ever made

a review of a review this is simply in response to the latest review made by a viewer about this film i quite simply feel that the review has a level of narrow mindedness about the film and recommend not basing your choice on their review to state do the world a favor and get rid of them as well as saying that these criminals are irredeemable and beyond any rehabilitation is very prejudiced the lack of restorative justice and the inability to find an effective deterrent is not necessarily the fault of the people who commit criminal acts but is that of the state before saying that you wish that the cop was there to take care of the hustlers and muggers that prey upon innocent visitors in otherwise beautiful places like montego bay and negril you should try to question why these muggers and hustlers even exist could it be because of the travler s presence in itself anyway i do not believe that you can justify killing criminals to satisfy your own traveling enjoyment it is reasons such as this that people who do lead a path of criminality do not get the appropriate attention and rehabilitation try questioning the methods of the state and not the hopelessness of criminals i recommend this movie it s an a just do not watch it with the mindset that this last reviewer quite narrowly insists 
glamour s underbelly revealed boogie nights does for the disco seventies and the porn industry what nashville did to country music it shows the underside of the glamour presented the film shows us all the trappings that draw people to the high life then pulls the rug out from under it we see the usual suspects and the usual draws there s money fame lust passion and drugs but these benefits provide an understated banality that comes to the fore the seemingly long drawn out conversations are only postcards of emotion that show the depth of personhood that seems to escape all of the protagonists it is superficial and all of life s best elements seem to go out the window there is the calculated cheesiness of the producer burt reynolds and his odd detatchment from his craft he both revels and drowns in the lust and money that are presented to him he meets a young aspiring hopeful mark wallberg who must overcome his poverty and alienation from home his naivete is striking and he doesn t entirely change in his innocence only becoming a casualty of it the way he practices to become the next bruce lee in the midst of his success as a novelty presentation is certainly a sad commentary about his life his new success doesn t make him all that happy including his rationalization that his movies are making marriages more passionate the aftermath of all the calculated lust makes everyone except the calloused producer a casualty in a different way one fellow porn star don cheadle demonstrates that his true passion is for a loving marriage and a hi fi business but the decent conventional world won t let him similarly a fellow porn creator william macy shows tragically that love transcends lust even when it won t ever become realized a female porn star is devastated by her cocaine addiction and an inevitable result of a custody battle if we aren t convinced near the end of the movie then a candid camera scene between rollergirl and the man off the street certainly shows how the emotional baggage catches up to all of the porn industry s false promises for true happiness the initial draw to boogie nights may be deceptive it presents the glamour of all that the modern world believes to be desirable but cleverly shows how the lowest common denominator can restrict our lives from even greater happiness 
best version ever probably the most romantic tragic movie i ve ever watched leaves the laurence olivier et al version for dead that movie finished half way through the book ralph fienne s tortured and damged heathcliffe is mesmerising but who cast sinaid o connor for christ s sake and binoche as cathy is of course hauntingsorry couldnt help it the eponymous scenery and the music score stay in your memory long after the film has ended you d be a hard heart not to enjoy this on 
the night of the fricken twisters the movie is awesome i really enjoyed the ending where the family is in there dodge minivan and they are driving mph and just happen to always stay right ahead of the tornadoes 
wow possibly the most powerful documentary ever ! never could i imagine in the u sa the most developed country in the world i d see people working or living in the same conditions as these people were in harlan county what impressed me the most was how strong the strike workers wives were to join their husbands at the picket line the scene were they defiantly blocked the road with their vehicles and refused to allow the scabs picket crossers to pass especially with guns drawn at them brought tears to my eyes two thumbs up ! 
absorbing drama a complex drama in two movements this was a worth adaptation of anita shreve bestseller artistically directed for kathryn bigelow whose style camera work reminds us to the chabrol of the seventies the butcher and antonioni l eclisse the story is told in parallel times when two modern couples decide to go to new hampshire and visit the stage where two brutal murderers were commited years ago in which an innocent man is declared guilty and punished with death the slow rhtym is revealed with nuance and psichological mood the defiant glances the sensuality and the lack of inspiration of william burroughs sean penn precisely in contrast with absence of creative fire his husband seeks the clues far beyond the official story she will be rebuilding this macabre and mysterious puzzle involved in a complex web of silents incest and madness in both narrative lines the tension grows and these stories admirably never intersect but they are edited perfectly with extraordinary and dramatic links all the characters have something to hide the loneliness and hopeless are just behind the door the poetry spills through the plot and the beating mistery slowly appears in front of the viewer with its merciless crudeness sarah polley stole the show with her complex acting she is an overwhelming young actress and is a hopeful promise in this craft together with naomi watts certainly there is an undeniable european influence in its descriptive and paced flow the corporal and visual languages are fundamental in this superb work watch that film bigelow reveals as a great promise director with this work 
a rare genre piece simply put the other is truly a slow moving story but has a certain creepiness that tends to open the doorway to the imagination don t waste your time on the film until you have read the book there is a certain uncomfortable feeling you get while reading the other a stirring haunting feeling that starts at the base of your spine then travels upward while all the while building supense i would have to recommend this book to those who have not experienced it s touch beware though if this book is suddently coming back into print then one has to ask is another remake on the horizon do yourself a favor read the book see the original film and stay away from hollywood s desire of remaking every classic movie into garbage 
hans christian andersen was a christmas present for my neice she loves the old danny kaye movies so it was the perfect addition for her collection 
bring tissues you ll need them because you re going to laugh as hard as you cry i loved the books as a girl and i adore this movie and the sequel as well while no book and movie can ever folloiw one another exactly it keeps so strongly to the story i almost had to go back to figure out which details they left out megan follows did a terrific job as anne and it was a great acting challenge as well as anne grows from about the age of to in this movie and megan follows was or i believe yet her ability carried her through as a very believable year old the rest of the casting was inspired the characters looked and acted almost exactly like i had always imagined them anne is human she gets mad she gets hurt she acts or speaks before she thinks and this makes her believable to any child or any one of us who s ever done something like that welll worth owning and showing to anyone who ll watch 
very good c d good quick service and good price jim

the scariest movie about giant bugs ever this is an excellent monster movie pure and simple it is not really campy or funny but it manages to do something that few monster movies do nowadays it scares you yup the atmosphere for this movie is great and the movie is very unpredictable it seems if del toro took quite a bit of care to avoid cliches and he definitely succeeds if you want a monster movie that is actually scary pick up mimic if seeing a giant roach killing a child does not shake you up a little bit watch this on a rainy night i give mimic a out of rounds up

s classic this movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different this is a comming of age film for the s the acting is wonderful it is a different style of movie there were some really great movies comming out then ferris beulers day off pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful this is another one it is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time the s is a time i was fond of i do not find it tacky as the media is right now this movie is funny some of these classics get refered to in other movies you might want to watch it 
ab original this really fine film deals with itself on its own terms and does not try to answer all of its own questions for example the death and position of the native boy in the tree reflects the way the father ended at the beginning and suggests the same sexual passion for the girl which explains her attitude toward her dad and perhaps his immolation some innocent nudity toward the end well worth it 
what happens when mister right appears to two sisters as the perfect man first off the man in the moon is a great film ! with robert mulligan the director of to kill a mockingbird and the summer of at the helm and a year old reese witherspoon as dani who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time the film certainly starts out on the right foot in a nutshell a tale of sisters some plot spoilers below its roughly the summer of in rural louisiana maureen trant emily warfield and dani trant reese witherspoon are sisters very close bonds hold them together but this summer will put a strain on their relationship the strain comes in the form of mr right appearing without warning as the boy next store his name is court foster jason london and he is years old the trouble is dani saw him first or more correctly he saw her the family knows that dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy but owing to the age differences and the boy s character nobody is worried except court he s got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around and perhaps more too much more then the plot thickens more plot spoilers below maureen never sees court until we re about halfway through the summer since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the trants when she does see him he has come to their house to visit dani but then something happens court and maureen are obviously taken with each other and dani can t believe it how could her sister betray her like this from this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when mr right appears to both of them as the perfect man robert mulligan directorsam waterston matthew tranttess harper abigail trantgail strickland marie fosterreese witherspoon dani trantjason london court fosteremily warfield maureen trantbentley mitchum billy saundersabout the dvd excellent widescreen transferspecial features theatrical trailer scene selections wish there were morebottom line this is a reel slice of life that won t disappointthis is quite a little story with a big punch the supporting roles are impeccably played with sam waterston playing matthew trant the father and tess harper playing abigail trant as the mother they have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of in louisiana 
witty fun real and relevant we have a small group of women meeting once a week and reading this book i love the way liz starts each chapter by retelling the story of the woman the way it may look if it was happening today and gives us a new insight into that life she then goes step by step through the bible verses and does a study on them showing insights and ways that it relates to us today the questions at the end of the chapter are good as well and the whole diverse group of us is learning there are different types of women in the bible and each of us relates to at least one of them ! i like the catagories bad to the bone bad for a season and bad for a moment witty fun real and relevant to me today 
technically a b movie but has the heart of an a this has been one of my favorite movies for as long as i can remember even when i was young and i didn t understand all the jokes but when i recently rewatched it well my love of it was rediscovered this is a film that basically takes a pridictable and unoriginal story of two people trying to succeed in their sport and end up falling in love and makes it instantly memorable for its snappy dialogue and fun one upmanship of the main characters this film would be worth it for some its insults alone ! overall i would say it is a diamond in the rough but if you are looking for a serious film then this might not appeal to you the cutting edge is pretty much a fun filled romp from start to finish 
wanda s opinion this is one of the greatest movies i have watched i know i have probably watched the movie twenty times in the past it has heart and compassion it is absolutely one of the best i have see 
western my second favourite john wayne movie the first being she wore a yellow ribbon a great cast and very entertaining as the westerns from this era are far superior to those of today the movie shows just because you are superior in rank doesn t mean you know everything the battle of wills between two of the greats john wayne and henry fonda was handled beautifully by these two veteran actors throw in a great supporting cast of ward bond victor mclaglen shirley temple john agar and you can t miss i highly recommend this movie to add to your collection glad to see it finally came out on dvd 
daniel deronda discovers his destiny daniel deronda is a fascinating character study as it relates to a man faced with two seemingly impossible challenges he must realize his true calling and conquer his superficial desires to embrace a much more complex love the story unfolds in over three hours of lush settings gorgeous period costumes and romantic vistas yet all the while the story is being told you can feel the deeper connections between the characters as you come to terms with their individual destinies the beauty of this masterpiece theatre series reveals itself with startling honesty in a drama where emotions are mostly simmering beneath the surface love as a commitment and love as a game reveals two contrasting worlds this dance in a world of decadence turns into a game of survival where the choices of the two main characters hold lives in the balance one wrong decision and the fate of everyone around them is changed forever daniel deronda and gwendolyn meet and mingle in a world of wealth but in their hearts they long for a more challenging life fraught with conflicts only the soul can fight gwendolyn is in a controlling marriage while daniel is still finding his way in the world of love like a knight he seems to prefer courtly love to a long term commitment but this starts to change when he meets a beautiful jewish singer who he rescues from drowning gwendolyns wild exuberance while horse riding seems to represent her inner tenacity and as it is only when she has been broken herself and then healed that she too finds her true heart this series captures an excellence so few period dramas ever try to attain at first chilling and calculating this story warms to a shimmering brilliance i shall be better for having known you gwendolynthe rebecca review 
welcome to the genre that is john carpenter john carpenter s second feature assault on precinct is nothing short of a masterpiece of original flmmaking back in the mid seventies when cinema verite and political thrillers where the norm john carpenter came up with a fresh and back to basics flmmaking approach that was simply entertaining and truly original assault on precinct is carpenter at his finest as the film introduces the audience to what would later become the trademarks of his style masterful panavision compositions tight suspense sequences and a thumping synth score that is simply minimilastic brilliance with a simple plot that serves as a launching ground for character interactions and suspense set pieces that showcase carpenter s stylish direction this is carpenter at his most creative back when he made interesting original and always entertaining films before his downfall in the s when self indulgence led to such works as village of the damned and ghosts of mars the image region dvd features a nice widescreen print but sadly only a mono soundtrack which serves the film fine but with a score of that quality a remix is truly called for the disc also features an astounding and inspiring commentary by carpenter brilliant 
when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
buuuuuuuddddddy before yesterday i had seen just about every pauly shore movie but this one this has to be one of pauly shores best works yea he s cheesy looking back on these movies now but as cheesy as he is it makes me laugh and i had a good time watching the flick if you have never seen this older movie give it hours of your time youll be amused 
good film bad dvd this moody drama piece is for the most part very good mickey rourke is excellent in the title role a disfigured criminal who gets a shot at redemption but ultimately chooses revenge well directed by walter hill with a good music score by ry cooder all the cast do a good job the story is tight and fast paced and some good action sequences to boot pity about the dvd it s fullscreen and this deserves to be in glorious widescreen 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
didn t know what to expect very impressed v for vendetta was already out on dvd before i finally saw it my college roommates told me that it was a great movie so i finally went to blockbuster and rented a copy the next day i returned the copy and went to best buy and bought my own copy of the movie it was that good v for vendetta takes place in the not so distant future in england where the residents have a curfew that they need to follow if they don t want to be arrested dirty cops and policemen hand out their own cruel form of justice and where our female hero evey payed by natlie portman lives after being cornered by several dirty cops evey is rescued by the charismatic fast talking highly intelligent masked man simply named v v is a man of many words and he explains in the movie that he is tired of the big brother style of living that everyone has to endure although the government controls the entire city v is upset that the population is not fighting back and taking back their own lives he explains he is a one man crusade to evey as he blows up the old bailey building to opera music as he laughs uncontrollably at one point this is a movie anyone will like except you probably wouldn t want the kids watching because of the violence and language v is a guy you will totally like because he is charming to the ladies cool to hang out with and watch movies his favorite is the count of monte cristo and also is one tough son of a bitch who uses knives and martial arts to take out his enemies evey is also great to see in this movie she is the daughter of political activists who were killed after speaking too loud against government corruption she also literally got her head shaved in one of the scenes in the movie ! natalie portman was great the movie is awesome to watch it is fast paced and exciting in a lot of scenes from v taking over the tv station in england and talking on every single tv screen in the city as he fights the government to evey getting caught by the government and sitting in a cell for several months with a shocking ending great movie to see the extras include freedom forever the making of v for vendetta designing the near future the artistic look at making v for vendetta remember remember the look at the man named guy fawkeseaster egg ! a saturday night live digital shortplus more ! 
spectacular this is one of the finest productions i have ever seen too bad more aren t being produced 
sophisticated comedy the combination of grant and kerr is wonderful on the screen i loved the mix of british humor and civility adding the dash of american brashness in robert mitchum one can enjoy watching the wheels fall off a very enjoyable movie

probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
tim roth is gifted i was inspired to write because i like this actor so much the movie s script may seem improbable jail dentist having affair with inmate but who really knows certainly the acting ability of the leads julia ormand and tim roth convinced me that the characters were destined for each other the depiction of life inside people s motivations both good and bad seemed very realistic and thought provoking i liked to see at least one movie that doesn t equate criminality with being evil or insane sometimes it s just the bad stupid actions or mistakes that good people make yes he committed the crime but he is paying for it also i m a hopeless romantic and the movie indulged me e g the sex scenes were incredibly erotic and tim roth is my ideal of a man with intelligent sex appeal i believe this movie would appeal to both sexes for different reasons 
electric ampgrand this video blows the mind this is a golden time in soul music so many great talents this is what soul music used to be about great talent ampfull of fantastic performances 
i like this better than ian holm s lear because john hurt s portrayal of the fool is splendid so many productions of lear get this crucial character wrong including unfortunately ian holm s otherwise terrific production which i first saw on pbs but not sir laurence sincidentally shinnosuke ikehata listed in the credits as peter also portrayed the fool memorably in ran kurosawa s famous adaptation of lear 
a valuable message i liked this movie very much it was entertaining funny charming but i especially liked the twist toward the end i felt it put out a message that really needs to be understood by everyone these days that is as this movie attempts to show the feelings shared between partners in same sex relationships are no different than those shared in hetero relationships they are just as genuine moving loving and caring everyone can relate to them if they just let themselves i applaud the writer and those who starred in the movie 
great i was impressed the very first time i saw this film and i enjoy watching it every year a fine cast makes it believeable the early hours of world war two this film truly shows how unprepared we were but also shows the dedication of our american servicemen 
extraordinary reel life as a journalist familiar with yugoslavia and the tragedies of its breakway states i was prepared to dislike this movie about foreign journalists working during the siege of sarajevo i thought here goes hollywood exploiting an abomination of the th century what i saw in fact humbled me and moved me to many tears director michael winterbottom takes an unflinching docudrama approach integrating real news footage of atrocities with his no frills production there is no exploitation of suffering here winterbottom has an unabashed agenda to shock inform educate and enlighten it is hardly entertainment the result devoid of sentimentality glamour and a neatly packaged denoument is refreshingly un hollywood the characters played by woody harrelson marisa tomei in a small role kerry fox stephen dillane and the fine croatian actor goran visnjic examine dilemmas journalists habitually face in war zones or not how to remain objective whether compassion is appropriate and whether or not to become involved with a story the journalists part of a profession where bravado gallow humour and stamina for drink and adrenalin go with the territory bring these characteristics to the fore in their perilous bunker sarajevo s infamous holiday inn the film is based partly on the true story of michael henderson s played by dillane experience in war torn bosnia henderson then others cross the line of objectivity in their promise to help some of the traumatised children of the bombarded city there are no easy answers in war i read how the film moved a physician to serve in bosnia and has been used to educate students in modern history who needs an oscar with real life affirmations such as these 
taut film noir crime drama dana andrews stars as hard boiled belligerent detective mark dixon in the otto preminger produced and directed where the sidewalk ends gene tierney playing model morgan taylor once again teams up with andrews as they did so successfully in the classic noir lauraandrews abhorence for mobsters was spawned by trying to live down the reputation of his father a noted gangster he was called into an murder investigation of a high roller at a floating crap game hosted by unctuous gangster tommy scalise played by gary merrill the stabbing murder was precipitated by a slap to the face of tierney who was accompanying the high roller with her soon to be ex husband ken paine played by craig stevens andrews who had just been dressed down by his boss inspector foley for his penchant for violence accidently kills stevens when an interrogation turns violent he then proceeds to cover up the crime unfortunately tierney s father jiggs played by veteran actor tom tully is implicated in steven s death having visited his flat around the time of the crime andrews and tierney commence developing a relationship andrews becomes tortured by his decision to cover up the truth and let tully take the rap preminger does a nice job in presenting the psychological dilemma faced by andrews as he is torn deciding between right and wrong the moody nature of where the sidewalk ends is typical of the classic film noir 
an exotic vehicle for garbo mata hari garbo is a german spy posing as a dancer in paris she is sent by andriani lewis stone to get russian messages about military movements needed by the allies during the first world war changed though it may be from the actual career of mata hari the dutch dancer and spy the picture is an entertainment of no mean value in which that mysterious actress garbo gives another flawless performance the star may not be any more like the ill fated spy whose real name was margaret zella macleod than the film narrative is like an authentic account of the spy s career there is however in the skillfully arranged series of incidents enough truth to make a most compelling melodrama garbo is stunning and full of her special mystique as the javanese dutch spy who in real life was shot at saint lazare france in both garbo and navarro had accents which caused the critics to snicker especially a line of navarro s which sounded thusly whats the mata mata british censors had a problem with navarro becoming so hypnotically seduced by garbo and greta s famous exotic dance before the malaysian idol is stunning mata hari was a dutch pseudonym meaning eye of dawn 
it s really a cute movie the other evening my husband was watching this movie on television while i was reading a book he kept getting tickled and every time he laughed i d have to look up to see what was so funny i rolled my eyes at some of the corny humor but finally had to put my book down and start watching i have to say i enjoyed this movie and couldn t help laughing out loud quite a bit myself i always enjoy seeing tommy lee jones and he wears his same old gruff exterior in this movie but with a nice comedic edge he plays roland sharp a texas ranger who is hired to protect a group of texas longhorn cheerleaders after the girls witness a mob killing in order to give them full protection and still allow them to fulfill their cheerleading duties roland pretends to be their cheerleading coach and moves into a large house with them there are some really very funny scenes in this film as the girls try roland s patience time and time again they re not happy with being cooped up all the time and having their social activities curtailed and monitored and they give roland grief every chance they get he s more than a match for them though and they soon find out that where their safety is concerned the man of the house means business theres a nice subplot here about roland s relationship with his estranged daughter also lovely actress anne archer has a nice role as an english professor who roland becomes attracted to some of the funnier moments in the film take place when the cheerleaders decide to rally around their bodyguard helping him to smooth over his rough edges and win the girl this movie is cute and it s funny give it a try ! you just might find yourself laughing a whole lot more than you thought you would ! 
a charming clever british comedy charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly played role as england s king henry the eigth who infamously married six different queens divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty capacious king laughton as ever is a marvel skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly cariacatured lout and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point this is all about the cleverly rendered script which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads and on the classy ensemble acting which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print im writing in the year perhaps criterion or some other class act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon still fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot 
perfect the best dvd that i ever saw perfect to make a party and play this dvd and everyone is gonna like your party 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
reassuring this is the least preachy bible study i ve ever read kushner divides his chapters by themes and suggests but does not demand a theological answer which supports his thesis that an all knowing god can server the cause of good yet not function as a safety belt he supports it with elements from his own experience since his language is comforting and conversational anyone can relate to him as a speaker well worth it ! 
not as good as the book if you enjoyed reading the book as much as i did you might be disappointed with the film the film cut good character development that i felt was sorely needed but you can t help but to enjoy a good ol pirate movie 
enter the creepshow tickets please it is perhaps best to initially take a glance at the comic books that inspired this collection of creepy tales pulps published throughout the s and s by e c comics and boasting such titles as tales from the crypt haunt of fear weird science and vault of horror television was still in its early stages and it would be a few years before quality horror made its way onto the screen horror fans then targeted the news stands for their fix of the unreal and the unnatural they were introduced to tales of rotting corpses and ghouls rising from the grave by the crypt keeper and his fiendish friends the vault keeper and the old witch there were adaptations of poe and lovecraft and ray bradbury see the october game frequently contributed stories further enhancing e c comics popularity two young readers of tales during the s would have been horror icons stephen king and george a romero the comics having a considerable influence on their own future works sadly censorship laws meant that e c comics were taken off the market but they would not be buried forever which brings us to creepshow released in creepshow is a homage to e c comics the film is directed by george a romero and is based upon short stories and a screenplay written by stephen king there would follow an actual comic book titled creepshow featuring cover art by legendary e c artist jack kamen and interior art by bernie cycle of the werewolf wrightson in total there are five tales and a wraparound story each tale begins with a comic book style animated segment the wraparound story features a young boy stepehen king s son joe whose creepshow comic is confiscated by his abusive father tom halloween season of the witch the fog atkins and so begins the first tale fathers daynathan grantham is killed by his own daughter after years of mental abuse and an apparent murder he returns as a hideous corpse exacting revenge on the entire grantham family stars ed harris the lonesome death of jordy verril aka weeds backwoods hick verril stephen king witnesses a meteor crash land into his own backyard before long the entire property is turning green and verril has to fight for survival against an alien plant life something to tide you overanother revenge story featuring ted danson and leslie nielson and arguably the best of the five tales nielson plays a wealthy jealous and unhinged husband who buries his wife and her lover up to their necks in the stretch sand that is his private beach comfort point but the tide has a way of returning the past the cratewhile cleaning the student halls of a maine university one evening the janitor discovers an ancient crate buried beneath the stairs chained within is a bigfoot like monster that has been locked away for over a century meanwhile local college professor henry has been subjected to years of humiliation from his overbearing and obnoxious wife his only solace is a weekly chess game with co professor dexter stanley it is now time for the creature to feed and henry has a plan that might well solve all his problems starring hal holbrook adrienne barbeau both of the fog and fritz weaver theyre creeping up on youa selfish and miserly tycoon with a tendancy towards hypachondria finds his supposedly bug proof and germ proof apartment infested with cockroaches check out king s f computer game which includes the bug splat game taken right from this tasteless tale starring e g marshall tommyknockersand so ends the show but before we leave the auditorium lets return to the wraparound story where little tommy has taken to practicing voodoo in order to exact revenge on his bad tempered father so what s the verdict five excellently written and directed shorts from two of the masters of horror creepshow moderately successful at the time of its release has maintained cult status ever since it will undoubtedly stand the test of time the special effects are top notch having tom savini at the helm he also plays a small acting role in the wraparound story and the acting is first rate sadly there are little tono extra features but the film itself makes up for this perhaps there will be a special edition in the future it would be nice to see some original interviews and deleted scenes creepshow was followed by creepshow and tales from the darkside before the tales from the crypt tv series emerged out sometime this year is creepshow 
cute ! funny ! fashionable great movie one of my favorites great cast wonderful costumes romantic dialogue and a funny plot line is definitely light hearted and classic british comedy also a great introduction to oscar wilde 
drop in on a dying culture if you are interested in gypsy music and dance this is an incredible look at the culture sans boring narration blah blah because mr gatlif had unprecedented access to these relatively unspoiled groups of performers the viewer feels like a traveler on the gypsy trail starting out in india through egypt turkey and through the balkans ending with a lively village flamenco scene i wish that they had continued into england and ireland but that is a minor quibble each scene goes directly into the performances with so much feeling and joy not to be missed 
great film ! cooper stanwyck the professors i paid with a gift card once and now i am gift card recipient sheeshanyway great film very excited to see it will be released to dvd on may very concerned that the specs the film is color ! as it was not filmed in color please do not tell me this wonderful film has been colorized i am hoping this listing as color is an error and we will all be happy with the dvd if it is color not sure if i will purchase it after waiting so long

great video another great richard scarry video this video teaches kids in a way that is interesting and fun for them without being obnoxious for their parents ! we love it 
one of the better stephen king adaptions this is somewhat of an important horror film atleast for me that has been forgotten or maligned over time when it came out all of the popular horror movies were hack and slash dead teenager empty boogey men tales stephen king adaptions helped put the humanity back in horror even if the films didn t always do his books justice the shining children of the corn this was the first one to really strike a cord since carrie there are no heroes here and no real villians either no starry eyed buxom brunette or burly square jawed male is triumphant in the end no silent intense man monster gets it in fact it doesn t end happily at all something of a rarity in popular horror at the time also rare is that all the performances are st rate as is the music wonderfully haunting and sentimental at turns the lighting of the movie is documentary like giving the film a realism and naturalism lost in today s underlit over stylized gore fests it also makes the shift from family drama to zombie tale feel all the more startlingly believable though underdeveloped and slightly rushed what you thought paramount then home of friday the th would produce a hr character drama about a man terrorized by his dead family this movie is a fast paced horror tragedy with real heart in its story and performance and direction a rarity in hollywood then and now too favorite quote from the film lie down play dead be dead ! 
my favorite disney movie spoiler warning this review might reveal surprises in the movie first off for a frame of reference i m a year old male and a sucker for disney movies in general when this movie came and went to the theatres in a flash i heard so much bad about it how it was the worst disney movie ever that i actually didn t go see it in the theatre i regret that now first time i actually saw this movie was on a hour flight from los angeles to london and i fell heads over heels in love with it i adored the original novel treasure island and i believe that treasure planet lives up to it the central theme of treasure planet in my mind is the boy jim who grows up with only a vague recollection of his father who in the movie appears like a shadow in jim s faded childhood memories i think this particular flashback scene was very powerful it featured the absolutely brilliant im still here track by johnny rzesnik and led the viewer to fully understand jim s childhood and to share his teenage frustration and delinquency that stems from his father abandoning the young jim and his mother possibly i might a bit biased in this respect since i can strongly identify with this situation as my own father was married to the sea when i grew up and i can admit that i blubbered like a baby during the flashback sequence this is right in line with the core message of the film a young reckless and frustrated boy who is taken under the wing of the old salt who becomes his new father figure he learns how to take orders work hard grow face adversity and eventually become a man by making tough choices an excellent message in this day and age if you ask me i also loved the theme the producers chose a type of anachronistic retro futuristic design where we in the future still use old creaking wooden pirate ships but with ultra futuristic systems the movie also suspends the viewer from reality in many flavorful ways for instance when the spaceship travels through the universe it encounters a pod of whales or how jim takes a dhingy comet surfing i think this film provides excellent entertainment suspense and has a great message for kids but as an adult i think i also got a kick out of this great and clearly underrated disney flick see it 
boatload of fun ! recommended what more could you ask for in a movie are you delighted by cary grant s charm or sophia loren s beauty do you want to laugh see gorgeous outfits hear loren sing or root for the under overdog would you like a romantic comedy that teaches lessons in responsibility for children and parents move right in to houseboat i am always amazed when i see a film with a plot that casts sophia loren as the overlooked lover vying for a man s affection it started in naples the millionairess but the notion of seeing what isn t in the eye of the beholder draws you to each film as you impatiently await the leading man to discover her cinzia zaccardi loren is the wealthy daughter of orchestra conductor arturo zaccardi eduard ciannelli as such she is lavished in opulent dwellings and dinners with international nobles what s missing from this overprotected woman s life is a man tom winters grant is a diplomat who neglected his parental responsibilities for the sake of his career after his wife dies he gets the urge to do the right thing the problem is he is evidently clueless about what that is he quickly learns that raising children is a joint responsibility though he hires an unlikely nanny he feels the logical matrimonial choice is a woman who helped care for his three children before he came on the scene his current nanny who neither cooks nor cleans well is good at eventually obtaining whatever she wants after all she s the spoiled runaway daughter of arturo the orchestra conductor despite the too often sung bing bangbong song houseboat is a repeat watch movie my only problem is that i ve seen it so many times on vhs that i would only purchase it used on dvd at a heavily discounted price just to complete my collection update i bought the dvd the movie may have a corny moment or two but it includes far more hearty laughs and great actors so i recommend it to others 
finally a cartoon that teens and adults can just enjoy this is one of the best idea s in movie history and what s good about it is they got adam sandler if your looking for an animated movie to laugh at and not fell like a little kid get this movie is for you what s good about this is it s funny and the animation is real good to the one part you can enjoy most about this movie is it is pg which is rare these days people want to trip about it mostly parents and when that comes up you wonder if they ever heard of something like rating meaning they tell you who it s for and everything cause it says it on the box it s not for children this is defiantly a movie to pass the time and escape with they guys who wrote this were daring which is a real good thing i really enjoy pg cartoon movies cause it can be fun and have a reason for it s humor and it dosen t have to hold back this is a real good movie so go and get it 
surprisingly moving and rich this fine film really snuck up on me emotionally but the superb performances of jennifer lopez sharon and jim caviezel catch are rich nuanced and ultimately captivating angel eyes works on so many levels suspense action drama and of course romance it intricately and sensitively deals with issues of life and death loss betrayal and redemption the ending doesn t tie up everything in a neat little cliched package either but aside from a wonderful script and crisp direction the key to this film is the chemistry of lopez and caviezel who can communicate so much from a look or a smile or tears particularly intriguing is the character that caviezel plays the enigmatic catch is he dead or alive an angel or devil is he psychotic or just deeply wounded somehow as the viewer sorts it all out caviezel plays mr catch as a warm yettragic figure who steals the viewer s hearts just as surely as he touches lopez s sharon speaking of lopez this is one of her best performances it s truly one from the heart she s gritty yet vulnerable tough but gorgeous i m not really a weepy type but all i can say is that sharon s amazing tribute to her father near the film s end had me getting embarrasingly misty eyed this is certainly a fantastic date movie it really would not be appropriate for children or younger teens however due to some salty language intense themes and brief scenes of sensuality i am amazed that caviezel didn t experience a superstar breakout as a leading man after this film but it is without question a brilliant and heart rending performance comparing his work here to what he has accomplished in other films including his landmark portrayal in the passion of the christ one sees his incredible versatility and range as an actor angel eyes is in some ways a collection of many small intimate vignettes that are woven together in a beautiful narrative tapestry while this film may not have burned up the box office in it s definitely a great way to spend an evening with someone you love 
i wish we could give stars quota really big shoe quot i taped these performances on my old monaural reel toreel back in the recorder and tapes are long gone but the memories of a time when four quottwentysomethingquot guys in suits could be considered revolutionaries still stands out in my mind as a golden age like it was yesterday i remember john wrestling with his microphone ed admonishing the audience about their behavior i even remember the other acts we had to sit through to get to the fab four what a time capsule ! the image quality and sound will blow you away much better than what we ever received over the air back in the day you even get a choice of monaural or surround sound sharp this cd set is a great treat for anyone over a certain age the break point may be years old young i imagine kids today may find it difficult to understand how one band could generate this much excitement and energy but if you were around in and you saw them live you know ! buy this with confidence and throw in the dvd of a hard day s night both are a must have for any beatles fan now if i could only fit into my old neru jacket life would be perfect 
move over darling this movie is a light comedy where you can just relax and watch not to mention have a good laugh 
women willing to carry things over the edge well if you need a mega dose of sex and violence to get the attention brought to an important issue then be it i believe the message of this movie and the reason it was banned in france is the emasculation of the male yes there is a graphic rape scene yes the girls also kill women but i believe it goes much deeper than that it addresses the underlying message of what is also beginning to happen in the world today women are saying enough ! for so long we have been seeing so much graphic sex and violence on screen and rarely is it even discussed here the people who perpetrate the sex and violence are young women so several alerts go off based upon our cultural and societal conditioning now when you consider that all of that conditioning has a very dominant patriarchal and masculine slant you see most obviously why this film presents so many problems to the viewers again in this film the people who perpetrate the sex and violence are young women alert that is just unacceptable in a patriarchal society we hear a dialogue between the girls about and show menstrual blood alert that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society the women like sex in their words they like to f k alert that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society the women appear to use or violate or rape the men that they encounter and then throw them away or kill them alert that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society they laugh and joke after on of the girls vomits into the lap of the male she just performed oral sex on alert that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society they kill a man on the roadside who speaks in a vulgar way to them alert that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society in short i think that most people cannot handle this film because it shows the raw feminine amazonian power of these two women who have had enough of taking the normal and acceptable crap that women must deal with on a regular basis and everywhere the male viewers will get a mental castration with this film and they probably deserve one does it make you uncomfortable that women can also be sexual predators does it make you uncomfortable that women can also be cold killers does it make you uncomfortable that they are not ashamed of who they are and what they do if so and your problem exists because they are girls who are doing this then it sounds as though you are a big part of the problem on the planet today if this was your typical buddy film where the characters were men who went on the very same rampage as these two women this film would be mainstream and considered normaltherein lies the lesson and the powerful message of this movie if you think that a family man should not be shot on the side of the road for making a harmless remark think again especially if that family man happens to believe that he has any right to say the following words to two young women walking by how would you like to feel my balls slapping against your a does he deserve to get shot i believe yes why today it is a fantasy or comment on the side of the road tomorrow it is a strong urge the day after it is a rape and this man is a father i wonder how he will train his own daughters people hate this movie because it shows men for what they are rude vulgar desperate pigs and why do people really have this film because the women call them on it they rub the viewers faces in it what man can handle that women have been on the receiving end of violence and sexual predators for thousands of years and if the sole message of this film is that women will not take it any more it succeeds bravo ! 
reality with star power this movie will make you laugh and cry with a who s who of hollywood the music alone will move you to the kleenex box if you have lost someone to aids this movie will touch you deeply i was told not to watch this movie alone watch it with someone to hug how right they were bronson pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have eric roberts and gregory harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples i know bravo ! get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect 
breezy tracy hepburn workplace comedy benefits mainly from their teamwork if you replace the constant use of the term automation with outsourcing this workplace driven comedy would be quite a relevant tweak on corporate restructuring and office politics as it stands now it s a light piece of entertainment that benefits primarily from a smart screenplay by phoebe and henry ephron noras parents must run in the family and of course the incomparable tracy hepburn teamwork it s not their best work but fifteen years into their relationship they achieve an easy laser sharp rapport here that makes the film easy to enjoy efficiently directed by walter lang the movie focuses its plot on the research department of a national tv network the so called federal broadcasting system the four woman staff is headed by the whip smart bunny watson who appears to possess a wealth of information and an unfailing memory for the smallest detail they work like clockwork together in finding responses to often extremely trivial questions but they do everything manually enter richard sumner a befuddled man with a measuring tape and mismatched socks who turns out to be a brilliant engineer hired by the network ceo to install an electronic brain called emerac designed to streamline the research process the monolithic computer has the research staff understandably concerned about pending unemployment invariably bunny and sumner start to recognize a mutual attraction through the awkwardness and further complications arise with the presence of mike cutler a rising network executive who has pompously kept bunny on a leash for years as bunny katharine hepburn appears to be playing a variation of herself which in this case suits the role perfectly by comparison tracy seems a bit tired as sumner except when interacting with hepburn whether unsuccessfully volleying brainteasers on a freezing rooftop eating floating islands in their bathrobes or canoodling between the second floor bookshelves during the office christmas party a terrific supporting cast has been assembled starting with gig young in his typical role as the third wheel mike which he plays with enough sharp and smarmy aplomb to make bunny s dilemma palpable joan blondell expertly plays bunny s stalwart sidekick peg and they achieve a genuine chemistry as they banter about the mexican avenue bus dina merrill and sue randall forever etched in my memory as beaver s crush worthy schoolteacher miss landers on leave it to beaver seem a bit too glamorous to be librarians but they re both serviceable while neva patterson plays emerac s coldly efficient mother miss warriner to brittle perfection even though the sets are pure sstyle dcor leon shamroy makes full use of the cinemascope process to bring his color saturated cinematography to the widescreen the dvd comes with a commentary track by film historian john lee who provides interesting insight to the production casting and stage toscreen translation merrill provides some remembrances of her own but her commentary is spotty and a bit self serving a vintage minute long newsreel on the film s costumes a few trailers for other fox films of the period and a photo gallery complete the package 
great production values good story by far the best of the scarlet pimpernel films wonderful costumes and sets but what really sets it apart is the way that anthony andrews captures sir percy both as the fashionable fop and in his action hero persona fans of the book should be warned that the second half of the film comes from a different novel altogether eldorado and follows that story only in general outlines chauvelin s romantic interest in marguerite is also an invention of this film although it works but the whole thing so beautifully replicates the spirit of orczy s novel is better than the original in fact that i highly recommend it for all pimpernel fans 
the life of birds dvd it is the best nature documentary i have ever seen i have never before witnessed such amazing animal behavior and i was raised on public telivision 
awesome avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it s got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i d say it s the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it s got a real depth to it and isn t only fit for kids but teenagers like me and adults alike highly recomended i don t know if the downloading was not working in the past but it s definitely working now i ve downloaded a few and they all work fine for me 
baseball fans will enjoy this one the curse of the grebes is sort of a tribute to the red sox return to world series glory with cameos by damon timlin and renteria timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by emily dickinson with remarkable aplomb arthur changes gears is also great he gets a bike he s been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he s so worried about getting it dirty that he won t ride it 
really my all time favorite my husbands laughs when i say a movie is my favorite i have many favorites but this one really is i also love to read and what sets this adaptation apart is the way the two complement eachother truly brilliant the movie adds elements that the book didn t dwell on and the book covers all the details that movies just can t some movies can touch your heart in such a way that they leave you a bit raw for me this is one of those movies no it may not be a cinematic event for all but for those who have loved with their whole heart and have been or even risked being hurt you will find a good laugh and a few tears here only nora ephron herself could have wrote a screenplay that complemented her novel so well and thankfully mike nichols brought it to life in such a way meryl streep really is at her best here and the whole cast is excellent i really do love this movie it always amazes me that it is so underrated give it a try 
with a frenchman in new york this movie never fails to humor me i lost my original video so i finally decided to get this dvd these two strangers andie macdowell and gerard depardieu couldn t be more oppposites i love the scenery of the park and the apartment with the lovely plants it isn t until the end that they learn what the two could offer each other it still frustrates me that they couldn t stay with each other in the end when they did realize that they loved each other 
there is an easter beagle the s were the artistic prime for the peanuts specials and its the easter beagle charlie brown is no exception the voices animation and music are all superb it has some quite funny moments such as the store having their christmas decorations up and marcie s antics with the eggs i wish some of the music was released on cd i don t know why it wasn t on charlie brown s holiday hits it s a classic perrenial show some have disliked the lack of religion but i think schroeder s quote its a time of renewal a start of spring is sufficient its arbor day charlie brown is a foreshadowing of the poor quality that would come in the s it was made in one year after be my valentine charlie brown but the voices aren t as good the voices are the main problem here although they re still better than the s but they re not the only one the backgrounds aren t as good and the baseball field is more brown than usual even with all the plants even vince guaraldi s music isn t quite as lively as usual still this is a good show with some quite funny moments it is fun to have a special for an obscure holiday even though i don t know when it is i don t understand the relevance of the charlotte s web game other than just commercialism i think it only works for the three to five age group a regular advertisement would have been more useful this is a fun dvd 
serious science fiction shocker tuesday is soylent green day that ominous statement is delivered in the film as a kind of tv advertisement an informational message aimed at the desperate denizens of an utterly socially ravaged world not so far removed from our own tuesday is a day they can look forward to because they can get soylent green considering the dismal nature of this future society it s something which is sadly believable this film remains one of the more starkly realistic and disturbing portrayals of a future in which people have almost nothing of their own including food and shelter they have little human dignity left either this is not the glorified future of star wars with blinking lights and merry talking droids and wise teachers over flowing with hopeful messages it s a dirty ridiculously over crowded nightmare where people treat each other as little more than cattle and even love is a dangerous luxury charleton heston plays a cop investigating the brutal murder of a powerful business man in his quest to find the truth he uncovers a thing so shocking it takes away loved ones nearly robs him of his own sanity and leaves the viewer with such uneasiness it approaches the dark tone of a horror movie however what makes soylent green so powerfully unsettling is that so much of the fictional story could indeed come to pass indeed this cautionary tale is even more timely now than when it debuted back in the s if you re looking for a sci fi romp through a colorful world of zippy space ships and wacky alien races look elsewhere this is hardcore uncompromising science fiction which will stay with you 
i like this movie when i was looking at this movie from the gay and lesbian list of films on border i didn t really think i would like it since i m a gay male and couldn t possibly like anything that had to do with lesbians let me tell you i was wrong i feel ashamed to even say that i couldn t like this movie let me explain the movie to you and you see if you wouldn t like it we start off with natasha lyonn playing the character megan bloomfield a cheerleader who is popular kind and the girlfriend of the star quaterback in highschool we see that she doesn t really like to kiss her boyfriend and her family at dinner prays to make things just the way god intended them to be after school her family some of her friends and her boyfriend meet her at her house for an intervention they claim that they fear she is a lesbian proving it with evidence of girls picture in her locker gay memoribilia in her room she s a vegetarian and the biggest one of all that she doesn t like to kiss her boyfriend after that she is taken to a sexual redirection camp run by mary j brown played by cathy moriarty with her staff rupaul playing the character mike who is an ex gay and her son rock played by eddie cibrian who isnt so manly himself where queer boys learn how to be men and dikey girls learn how to become happy homemakers sorry for the rude example this is where she meets clea duvall playing the character graham eaton seeming like the tough lesbian girl who will never surrender herself to the school unfortunately graham has problems of her own when we discover that she will not be aloud back home no car and no trust fund if she does not succeed this task the girls ultimately become friends and attracted to each other they even have a kiss session when they are rescued from richard molls character larry morgan gordon and his lover wesley manns character lloyd morgan gordon the training sessions are funny to watch especially with the men i don t want to ruin any more of the movie for you if you haven t seen this then you should i hope this review will get you to watch it

swashbuckling mutiny on the bounty is the fictionalized tale of an actual event whose repercussions are felt to this day captain bligh is charged with sailing the bounty to tahiti to harvest breadfruit plants for transplant to the west indies what should ultimately be a two year mission he is commander of a crew made up of both volunteers and those pressed into service by his majesty s royal navy the latter group being significantly less enthusiastic about their voyage bligh s discipline often crosses the line into malicious sadism and as the months wear on many in the crew begin to contemplate a mutiny which they execute shortly after departing tahiti bligh is put into a small boat with those of the crew who remain loyal and performs the amazing feat of sailing miles over days with very little provision he eventually returns to tahiti where first mate christian and the rest of the mutineers reside along with some of the loyal crew who wouldn t fit on the boat capture return to england trial and execution ensue for some of the mutineers mutiny is great not because of the acting laughton is tremendous as bligh gable is only servicable as christian and tone is poor as conflicted midshipman byam but because of the characters that make up the story those performances which are less thangreat are swallowed up by the flow of the story which you can almost feel as an inevitable force driving them all to their fate bligh is to mean to die christian is too noble to die byam is to honorable to die but each receives a very different reward for their actions the supporting cast is very solid and really conveys the sense of frustration and anger that builds as time passes on the bounty the shots of the bounty on the open ocean are magnificent and are easily the equal of those from master and commander however the obviously anglo tahitians can be pretty distracting to someone who s grown up in politically correct america still it s a minor point especially in the black andwhite format a true classic highly recommend 
so far so good i ordered this about weeks before christmas the delivery of this item was very prompt which i was impressed with the packaging was really good so i knew it got to my house safe the dvd was a gift to someone for christmas so i myself have not watched the dvd and i don t think the receipent has had a chance to watch it to see if it had any problems so so far so good 
only one question my only question is when can i buy season this is the perfect medium to continue the most enjoyed show that tv execs killed this decade 
best movie of the s i saw this movie when i was and i loved it since because it really does scare you and the fact that it doesn t include nothing that consists sexual scenes like other movies it is really creepy and gives you the chills just to think that mental clowns are in your house trying to kill you i recommend this movie it s the best

entertaining horror anthology this is one of a series of horror anthology movies released by amicus studios in the early s ie tales from the crypt the house that dripped blood vault of horror each anthology is held together by a certain theme in asylum a young psychiatrist interviewing for a job in an asylum is told that the head of the asylum has gone crazy and is now a patient the young psychiatrist must hear the stories of some of the patients and then determine who was the head of the asylum if he is correct he gets the job the stories give the feel of old horror comics which inspired many horror anthologies the characters are one dimensional and driven by such deadly sins as greed and lust in most cases with a twist and a touch of macabre the fates get their revenge on the evil doersthe stories are mostly enjoyable and solid entries in the horror anthology genre the british countryside where the stories are mostly set adds an extra chill the movie is recommended most to fans of horror anthologies such as hbo s tales from the crypt or stephen king s creepshow and the movies noted earlier it would also be great for those who remember how much fun these movies were when they first came out more general audiences would be entertained but i don t think this movie should be ranked with star horror masterpieces the exorcist halloween psycho nor would i expect most general audiences to rank it so highly the dvd quality is definitely noteworthy having sharp rich colors which enhanced the movie s experience 
individual and society a la kurosawa i agree with all the other reviews which have discussed ikiru in terms of its message for the individual live your life with meaning and purpose take pleasure in helping others cherish and nurture children however there is one other aspect that i d like to highlight kurosawa s thoughts on the individual and society as the commentary by stephen prince makes clear one of the main points behind kurosawa s work was a head on critique of japanese society in the immediate post war era although this period laid the foundation for japan s economic recovery kurosawa is not alone in pointing out that the drive for economic prosperity was accomplished at huge human and spiritual cost this idea is also one of the prime motivators behind the work of other japanese artists from humanists like hayao miyazaki spirited away princess mononoke to the lunatic right as exemplified by mishima kurosawa uses watanabe kenji as a foil to expose the hypocrisy and selfishness of a society that values materialism and order above humanity and mindfulness on the one hand as most of the other reviewers have pointed out kurosawa condemns the way the bureaucratic small mindedness of government stifles any real concern for the well being of ordinary people on the other watanabe s son and daughter inlaw embody the new age s impatience with its elders and their inability to see beyond their own concerns even when the people around them are clearly in crisis a number of people have complained about the length of the second half of the movie but as prince s commentary again makes clear the flashbacks are important to establish a stronger sense of watanabe s co workers as characters both to illustrate their gradual understanding of the meaning of watanabe s life but also to highlight their inability to really follow his example kurosawa s view of society is pretty cynical when you come right down to it even though many of his works are celebrations of individual creativity and spirit he is also forthright about the forces arrayed against it small mindedness fear of making mistakes greed and the herd mentality it s no wonder that he has often been accused of being unjapaneseone can also see this thread in kurosawa s later movies including his period pieces such as seven samurai and kagemusha in both of these films the ordinary folks and the high and mighty are also found wanting as groups while there may be individuals of principle they will not prevail in the end but and kurosawa makes this point in each of his movies the efforts of such individuals are the true definition of nobility of spirit and it is this message which provides the power behind all of his works this is a wonderful piece of movie making it is humanism at its most trenchant and finest you must see this film it is one of the best movies of all time 
feeling sorry for yourself ever feel like life is getting you down this is the movie that will make you realize that you have nothing to complain about feeling sorry for yourself watch my left foot you may see your troubles are not so bad after all worth getting the special edition for all the extra stuff 
fine film ! too bad about all the nazis in it as another reviewer rightly pointed out this film is one of the most influential films in cinema history a masterpiece of editing cinematography and all around directing it is a shame then that because of the subject matter much like the communism of battleship potemkin and racism of birth of a nation it is another film doomed to always be a taboo a guilty pleasure for film buffs i sincerely doubt it s the kind of movie you d watch with your girlfriend but as a historical piece it s still recommended the nazi party now in control of germany holds a party rally at nuremburg leni riefenstahl has been hired by adolf hitler to film it as a documentary to show young germans it opens with shots of the clouds flying over the city of nuremburg finally showing adolf hitler s plane landing from then on it is a collection of cheering crowds hitler youth festivals and military parades lots of military parades it is however a feast for the eyes riefenstahl sees to it that every single shot serves a purpose and that every scene flows together nicely some of my personal favorite sequences include a cat looking down on hitler s car as it passes the addressing of the workers a great bit of cutting in which men bring their torches together close and we cut to a firework going off most amusing of course is the propaganda value of the film there s a long sequence at the beginning showing the hitler youth laughing playing eating food and just being young boys watching scenes like this makes one almost think wow it must ve been cool to be a nazi this complex in fact still exists today in which people watch documentaries that may have intended or unintended falsehoods and readily believe it this film is important for three reasons first it is obviously a classic that if not respected then should at least be studied in terms of filming second it is an outstanding piece of history showing a regime that seduced a nation and would eventually move onto its own destruction third it is important to see the nazis as they wanted to see themselves and realize how they could have seduced a whole nation not everything out of hitler s mouth was purge the jews as dr anthony santoro explains in his commentary which by the way is an excellent listen especially when he points out a few bloopers germany had just gone through their own great depression and lived under the chaos of the weimar republic this film was meant to show the germans look at us now we are united we are strong we are better than ever most of all it was about the faith in the party santoro makes the excellent observation that the german army itself is in only about two or three minutes of the film the rest of the units are paramilitary units under the direct control of the nazis the film portrays a united germany not by the mere power of the german people but under the leadership and direction of one man adolf hitler some people are sensitive about the subject matter so this film may not be for them however if you want to see history or you re interested in examining the filmmaking or you re just curious i would definately suggest watching it 
the best one my kids are really crazy about these films but they think that this one is really the best one 
loyalty worthy of a queen a very pleasant surprise guarding tess brings to the screen the story of a secret service agent guarding the widow of a former president and all that that entails could he possibly be biting more than he can chew even though the american founding fathers would probably not be pleased with the way their successors have been abusing their powers and with the royal treatment that they have been receiving a far cry from the original humility and anti monarchist rhetoric one cannot stand idle and not recognize the strong bond that developed between the former first lady and her protector nicolas cage shirley maclaine and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their and it really shows the chemistry is amazing very well written and very well presented it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again the setting the plot the dialogues and the music are all wonderful in short guarding tess is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening s entertainment ! stars 
freakin awesome man this movie is one of the best movies ever made i am so glad that disney made it it always makes me feel better and plus it has the best song in the world on it it is stand out it relates exactly to me ! 
a true christmas lesson at its best unlike mr baker from santa clarita california who rated this item i think this film deserves much more than that and jake does learn the true meaning of christmas one just has to pay close attention and by pass all the commercialism involved yes he does start out self seeking and free wheeling but all that changes as he learns his hard lessons along the way for one thing it starts by him getting what he deserves a punishment by some jocks leaving him out in the desert and so the hard lessons start here from that point on the true meaning of christmas gets shown to him in various ways and just by wearing a santa outfit his hardships spawn some lessons he willingly sacrifices race winnings for a good cause even though the money was rightfully his a failed marriage gets repaired a crooked elf gets reformed from a life of crime plus one can see that the porsche is all forgotten in a tender moment with little esteban in the hospital who pines for his family no one can convince me that jake is not affected by that he is and it shows finally when the lesson is fully espoused it s remarkable how the climax is coupled with various holiday customs and traditions christmas hanukah and kwanza enmeshed in the local parade plus a group of carolers almost overcome by the running sleigh then as the time limit which determines if he ll receive the porsche approaches he is in no hurry but spends a few seconds with the girlfriend watching his family celebrate at the table through the window hence a sense of family fizzles through when all is said and done the hailed porsche is cast into total oblivion all he then wants is a family ride on the sleigh his lessons come hard but he learns again one has to get past all the commercialism to really get to the meat of this film and this film should get all the accolades and the respected place of all the time honored christmas films of the past i love jonathan taylor thomas he s a good actor and very handsome but this is not the reason for my customer review unlike what other people may think or how they may view it this is one of the best christmas films to teach what christmas is really all about 
talk about christmas spirit i really love bones it has everything suspense drama humor pretty people fun storylines i have yet to miss an episode and even into season this is probably my favorite it adds depth to all of the characters also the winter holidays are my favorite time of year i like holidays that are about what is good in the world bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day i cry through half this episode but in a completely good way buy watch it love it but watch it with a friend if you don t want to cry alone so moving great performances by the whole cast emily deschanel was powerful in this one she brings real vulnerability to brennan here david boreanaz as always the perfect sympathetic hero loveably old fashioned cute funny moments touching poignant moments this really is the best of what is great about bones 
awesome feel good movie this movie is awesome ! i wish more people had a chance to see this in the theaters ! i loved it so much after seeing it over my friends house i bought it here love 
the wind in the willows the wind in the willows by kenneth grahame was originally a series of bedtime stories for grahame s son it is still commonly considered to be a children s book but it is too difficult for young children to read themselves and many older children will no longer appreciate the simple themes it covers i imagine that its chief appeal is to adults although children might enjoy having some parts of the book read to them the characters mole rat badger and toad are wonderful creations mole rat and badger are conspicuously brave and loyal creatures they love the comforts of home and hearth yet they constantly set off on one rescue mission or another without a thought to their own safety toad on the other hand is a boastful nitwit and it is amusing to the reader to see him brought down to size again and again in reading this book you get the idea that grahame had thought for a long time about what it is like to be an animal he understands how their energy ebbs and wanes with the seasons and he writes that it is a great breach of animal courtesy to ask a favor during the winter when everyone wants to stay inside and doze during most of the day in summer though the animals are often abroad throughout the night and they may see the sky grow bright again before they return home grahame also has wonderful intuition about animal senses we others who have long lost the more subtle of the physical senses have not proper terms to express an animal s intercommunications with his surroundings living or otherwise and have only the word smell for instance to include the whole range of delicate thrills which murmur in the nose of the animal night and day summoning warning inciting repelling it was one of these mysterious fairy calls from out the void that suddenly reached mole in the darkness making him tingle through and through with its very familiar appeal even while as yet he could not clearly remember what it was what calls out to mole in the darkness is his home and a great deal of this book is an enumeration of the pleasures of home the snugness and familiarity the comfort of a well used chair in front of the fire and the simple pleasures of the table highly recommended 
twisted love story this movie is definitely a different kind of love story it really surprised me the first time i saw it it s a very honest movie that deals with issues that other movies rarely touch on like self mutilation and masochism i think that the actors were very convincing and that this movie is worth every penny i don t want to spoil it but it s a must see 
holy nostalgia i had the pleasure of watching this movie and the accompanying tv series in two different but equally enjoyable phases first as a th grader when they were first released in the s when i took them at face value as super hero adventure stories and later as an adult reveling in the campy humor and the droll dead pan delivery of adam west this is a very corny movie but in a good way ! lots of fun i especially enjoyed watching it while listening to the commentary by west and burt ward and by the way i m not a kid any more but i still want that batmobile in my garage and want to take the bat boat out for a high speed run on lake grapevine 
mr incredible great movie delivery of the order came in good time this disc collector s edition comes with some interesting extras i found the offtakes blubbers to be in bad taste but the rest of the extras were worth seeing personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie although it is interesting to watch especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself just my personal preference no doubt others will have different opinions 
ever seen a window kill a person this is a very weird little video nasty thats a sequal to suspiria it has beautiful colors but its a little random its still enjoyable the soundtracks unbelievabl 
heartbreaking and inspiring it s hard to believe years have passed since my life as a dog hit the international circuit and captured the hearts of audiences worldwide here it is again and the story has lost nothing of its relevance young anton glanzlius gives a powerful amazing unaffected and emotionally enormous portrait of a young boy who s world is falling apart and who learns to cope and accept the new direction life takes him i could go on and on but don t need to anyone who has seen this film already knows and anyone who hasn t seen it simply must one of the best swedish films i know certainly one of the most loved 
a subtle yet powerful western michael winner s chato s land may seem a bit below standard from other films that he directed but the strength in this film comes from charles bronson s stoic performance seen and unseen on the screen bronson s presence is there and is inescapable as is the baron land he habitats the visual forsaken look of the film s characters and landscape makes the viewer wonder what the point of this whole film is whatever bronson s transgressions may really have been the forlorn posse tracking him are representative of the worst qualities of society i saw this film when first released but with time i see the deeper social implications and commentary on society that director michael winner was making this is a good western but may be a difficult one to appreciate on an initial viewing 
over the edge a great movie about what can happy with big group of teens without much of pearent guidinc 
flawless delightful ! hilarious how often do we get to see a perfect performance we re closing in on a century of movies and as we can see it s pretty rare so flawless was judy holliday s portrayal of billie dawn that as a relative unknown she came from behind to beat out two heavyweights for the oscar in i m sure this was due in no small part to her refining the role for nearly three years on stage everything else fell into place as well broderick crawford was just excellent as harry brock crawford is able to swing you back and forth between anger and sympathy for his character not an easy task ! william holden is perfectly calm and reserved as paul verrall his character forms a wonderful opposite to billie and with direction george cukor worked his usual magic most of the themes are timeless a person lives in ignorant bliss until their eyes are opened they realize that there is a better life for them and begin their struggle for improvement they discover that their greatest opponents to advancement are not those above them but those at their current level a few of the elements are dated particularly jim s speech about how hard it is to find a corrupt politician in washington wow maybe that was the case in now it s impossible to find an honest one it all comes back to judy holliday this movie is her vehicle it is one of the most quoteable movies i ve ever seen would ya do me a favor harry drop dead youre just not couth i should take this pencil and draw a circle around you if there s a fire and i call the engines who am i double crossin the fire she was a rare talent who we were only able to see for a very short time i love all of her movies and this one born yesterday is my favorite thank you judy 
great surf film but please don t edit i won t beat a dead horse well maybe i will please re release this film in widescreen format anything less is defeating the purpose

love this show i never was very interested in the daytime soap opera dark shadows of the s with johnathan frid as barnabas however when they aired the new mini series in i was ecstatic i was hooked right away the atmosphere the charactors the set greystone mansion all of it was very intriguing i was appalled to hear that the show was to be discontinued after episodes i wrote to nbc several times knowing all and well that my words were just a waste one person or even couldn t change the minds of the production well anyways i m glad to see that i can purchase the series of tapes and watch them all over again thanks amazon com 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
two a half rooms worth seeing only the last two skits are worth seeing the first one is nice because it has some nice ahem visuales but has a dumb plot this movie or part of it is worth seeing some time but not buying 
national treasure this is a very enteraining movie and really enjoyed all of the intrigue that it had and the good ending 
great seventies film one nagging issue though a very enjoyable experience about voyeurism and who s watching the watchers jerry sorry for the seinfeld reference i won t go into detail about the film as others have already done so but one thing i don t think the gene hackman character would have done is to invite everyone back to his place after the convention i mean the guy is so obsessive compulsive and particular about his stuff that he wouldn t let a bunch of drinkers into his workshop not a big deal but something that bothers me a bit 
sergeant york dvd my all time favorite movie i had about wore out the vhs tape of sergeant york which i have had for several years and had hoped a dvd would be released i was so excited when i saw it being offered by amazon com and immediately put in my order as always amazon com came through with flying colors with the price and fast delivery time the story of sergeant york is a great story of the american farmer who works hard is honest and a strong believer in god although at the beginning alvin york was pretty much a hell raiser until lightening struck literally he came to know god and stayed strong in his beliefs even during time of war this movie is about a world war i soldier who single handedly captured germans during the battle of the argonne received the congressional medal of honor highest award for heroic action in combat and the distinguished service cross nd highest award for heroic action in combat yet with all the medals awards and recognition he received he never attempted to cash in unlike some lesser people of today he wasn t proud of what he did during war he didn t believe in killing yet when the companies wanted to pay him huge sums of money for endorsements he refused because he realized it was because of his actions during the war a wonderful feel good story and i would suggest if you don t know a lot about this american hero alvin york read some of the works about him which are sold on amazon com 
great movie this is a wonderful and accurate account of the mad queen of castille juana sister of henry viii s first wife catherine of aragon this is a great lavish movie that keeps you hooked from start to finish i recommend this if you love great entertaining historical pieces 
doctor who and the first download doctor who materialised without his tardis on this my first timelord download in the amazon unbox which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside for a very reasonable sum my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration where he encounters the nestene conciousness the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental a great experience and will not be the last easy to navigate and fun for all the family someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type tardis

talk to her with truly speak to you pedro almodovar has again given us a beautifully haunting film a film that causes us to truly think about our lives and the way we live it in talk to her we have the story of two men brought together by the women they love both of whom have fallen into a deep coma the first man is benigno martin javier camara a male nurse who has fallen in love with young aspiring dancer alicia leonor watling alicia has been lying in a coma for four years after a tragic car accident and he has been caring for her day and night ever since the second man is marco zuluaga the remarkable dario grandinetti a journalist who is brought to the hospital after his girlfriend bullfighter lydia gonzalez rosario flores is gored by a bull and thrown into a coma as well the real story here revolves around these men bonding in the face of their trials marco struggles with loving lydia struggles with guilt over her predicament and his battles with whether or not she ever really loved him benigno on the other hand ahs never had alicia s love for she never truly knew him but after spending four years at her side he feels as though they are in love and truly meant to be together he talks to her constantly divulging his secrets to her his passions and he begins to live her life for her watching the movies she once loved and seeing as much live dance as he can in order to have more to tell her the script is original and captivating and is only heightened by the superb acting and directing of this film benigno s unconventional love of alicia is a subject that is sure to cause a lot of controversy and talk but also is marco s devotion to benigno in his time of dire straights their relationship is an ambiguous one one that raises my suspicion especially in the final frames when marco sees alicia i m brought to wonder if he wants to be with her for himself or in an attempt to have yet another part of benigno you watch and you decide a truly wonderful and unique film 
favorite episode it was one of my favorite episodes a way to get buffy and angel together without changing the storyline and the characters where able to express how they felt to each other

van helsing what an interesting monster movie ! you get vampires werewolves frankenstein and dr jekyll mr hyde all rolled into one this movie takes advantage of the current state of special effects and makes most everything appear quite lifelike the film has an overall dark gothic feel to it with good performances by vampire hunter hugh jackman in the title role and by the lovely kate beckinsale the film is not for the faint hearted there s lot s of violence and gore if you re a fan of vampire movies you ll like this one

horror twisted this movie is not for the weak or for kids this movie is horror 
good movie i watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole mothman phenomenon so fortunately wasn t in a position to have my expectations dashed i guess that s the thing about movies based on real or alleged events and there s not much that can be done about it if you ve already read up on the whole incident the movie should be taken for what it is a good spine chilling paranormal thriller the special edition includes a minute documentary on the s mothman sightings on which the movie is based very interesting in its own right 
another adventure with cleo tbone and clifford this a great movie for all ages i am years old and i love this movie in this movie their is a group called larrys amazing animals in it their are dogs a cow and a ferret larrys amazing animals is like a circus this movie inspired me to have a circus of my own called the circus kids we will be performing in april or may what gave this movie only stars is when clifford leaves home of couse he comes back but that part is sad 
possibly renoir s finest film la bete humaine is my favorite renoir and one which tends to divide many of his critics and admirers for me it s an exhilarating and involving piece of cinema with characters destroyed by and destroying themselves in events in much more credible circumstances than in regle du jeu which gives it some real emotional and thematic weight beyond mere parlor games not to mention having the thrill of seeing post ww french doomed romanticism evolving into proto film noir before your very eyes these characters truly do all have their reasons and find their attempts to control events and other people backfiring spectacularly as they lose control in a way that none of the mannequins in regle do but it s all subjective jean gabin is superb the use of locations exemplary and simone simon was a babe even if she does try to bite 
please bring this series out on dvd fabulous show amazes me the number of stupid tv series that are being pumped out in droves yet an intelligent witty entertaining upstanding show like this has yet to be considered for dvd release what are these studios thinking 
cube has a classicly well put together screenplay held back by poor acting after reading the very positive reveiws of this late s thriller i decided that it deserved at least a rental i must confess that i am glad that i happened to stumble upon this movie on amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be the screenplay was very put together the plot setting were intriguing yet mysterious the killings or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy visuals are quite impressive for it s dollar budget now the only real complaint that i can say about the film is that the acting is horrid now dont get me wrong not all of the acting was that bad but i would be lying if i said that most of the actors were okay the truth is that most of them had very little experience and that made the film look all around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an elite horror film i think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors i thought that david hewlett played david worth the architect acceptably and i also thought that nicky guadagni s performance as helen halloway the doctor was pretty good other than those two i thought that the acting was very lightweight the guy that played quentin the cop was really bad which was quite a shame just because that characte had a big role in the film and was really important also i thought that they could have gotten a better and more experienced guy to play the role of the autistic boy or man it was some what hard to tell i know that i keep going on and on about the acting but i cant wonder away from the truth to much the concept and idea of the film was really quite brilliant the screnplay was brilliantly written and the story line meshed with extrodinary ease despite the acting i was heavily impressed and the film was overall very good grade b 
another great cheech chong film not as good as the first one but still pretty funny as far as i can tell there s not a whole lot of plot happening but it s a great movie all the same i really enjoyed it

random events and dreams become one woman s key this movie is so much more than what seems to be on the surface what appears to be a senseless act of terrorism aboard a train turns into an unraveling of the buried years of heartache abuse and lack of true love of one emily delahunty though she admits that even this is not her true name maggie smith brings this character to full passionate life and awareness emilyfor some reason is at her very best in life when she is caring for others she is unexpectedly put into this position when a bomb explodes in her train car leaving only herself and three other survivors emily has been a writer of bodicerippers and has published many of these fantastical romance novels under many nom deplumeswhat she encounters in the months of recovery with these three survivors at her villa in umbria as well as the continuous nightdreams she has set her up for the biggest and most important discoveries long buried in her own past she suffers from guilt and the unraveling of her life will prove to be the redemption of it this is one outstanding movie from hbo that needs to be viewed over and over to be taken in by the breathtaking countryside of italy and to miss the deep substance of this film would be a tragedy though smith is backed up by a marvelous supporting cast that include chris cooper and timothy spall this is her film and she does it as a dame should masterfully 
another good nicholson film this is the story of two navy lifers who are given an assignment of transporting an year old for a petty theft to prison one of the lifers feels pity for the kid and decides to show him a good time before he has to serve his year sentence the prisoner it turns out has not experienced much and the show him what he s missed all within a day period jack nicholson puts in yet another great performance while otis young and randy quaid put in credible performances other people make appearances like carol kane as a prostitute and look for a gilda radner before her saturday night live days in a brief apperance this is a very good film but i wouldn t say it were great for no particular reason other than it not being that interesting of a story nor a film that i would want to watch over and over again it definitely is worth seeing though at least for nicholson fans

gritty and utterly realistic fights the hunted is a fantastically gritty pulse pounding chase film with refreshing realism and is a fine return to form for the occasionally brilliant friedkin who has not been this on top of things since to live and die in l a i will not here attempt to offer a synopsis of the film as that has been done to death in this forum but will instead offer some commentary first those complaining that this film does not really have much of a plot or that the plot of this film is confusing and messy have entirely missed the point william friedkin was not here trying to make a story driven film at all as for the second complaint friedkin has stated that he purposefully wanted much of the film to remain ambiguous the viewer for instance is not supposed to know whether the del toro character is crazy or not those complaining that they can t figure out whether he s right in his suspicions or not have entirely missed the point of the film friedkin here was trying to develop an intense gritty extended mano ymano conflict between two men who are clearly more dangerous than anyone else in their environment jones character fearing he s found himself in a dr frankensteinian scenario having created a monster only he can stop feels both responsible to bring in del toro and guilty for hunting a man he essentially feels fatherly towards jones character could train del toro s to kill but after having done so he is unable or unwilling to help him psychologically this is insufficient training an insufficient initiation into manhood resulting in the playing out of the abraham isaac mythos unsophisticated viewers insisting on a good guy bad guy take on the film will likely not enjoy this movie jones character is not the good guy and del toro s is not the bad guy they are just both tormented men some viewers have interpreted jones character as the good guy but just as many will see del toro s character as a good guy being hunted down by his own government which he has just finished serving this ambiguity of not having a clear cut good guy and bad guy is exactly what friedkin was going for life is not black and white in fact such hollywoodian portrayals are naive and absurd those complaining that jones character is unrealistic should watch the film with the commentary turned on and learn about the real man that jones character is based on was it unrealistic that the two characters quickly fashioned knives out of raw materials in the wilderness not when the actors were trained to be able to do such themselves in real life what the hunted has to offer the viewer is an absolutely enthralling action film harkening back to the grittier days of action movies such as the french connection or bullitt the main character is fascinating to watch he s full of nervous energy that he is constantly shaking out he can t stay still he s twitchy something is clearly bothering him he knows how utterly dangerous his adversary is and feels responsible for teaching him the destructive maneuvers he knows the army trains men to be cold blooded killers this changes some men it s a door you can t walk back through the army does not train them to reenter society that s left to them and not all of them can effectively pull it off benecio del toro s character thinks the government is stalking him spying on him we don t know if this is true or if he s merely snapped what we do know is that he is an extraordinarily dangerous man who is out on the loose martial arts fans should take special note this movie has the absolute best and most realistic hand tohand fight scenes this critic has ever scene i say this having studied many martial arts in real life the art on display is kali knife fighting both tommy lee jones and benecio del toro trained in the art and did the fighting in the film it shows allegedly jones broke del toro s wrist in one of their fights these are the most gritty and breathtaking fight scenes you ll ever see the first of which i would pick as the best fight scene in film history they are utterly realistic and look very much the way a real martial arts fight looks ie brutal and short no nonsense wires or high flying kicks here just deadly street fighting the tracking scenes in this film are wonderful relishing the details the cinematography is downright breathtaking and the soundtrack is one of the greatest and most effective in years friedkin makes the viewer feel that even after the antagonist is brought into the city that he s still in a wilderness a wilderness of concrete blocks instead of trees and moss once the chase is on it doesn t stop until the end of this wonderfully fun movie ignore the negative reviews and check this one out !

wonderful memories wonderful cast enjoyed seeing the movie that i thought relayed the essence of christmas past loved seeing cary grant loretta young and david niven again 
a classic that ranks among the greatest of black comedies it is easy to understand why they changed everything but the bare premise of this movie for the remake after all the original staggered beneath the weight of massive burdens its star performer not only consented but actually seemed to delight in delivering precisely articulated dialogue in long blocks one after another and all at crackling pace too worse preston sturges clever witty script plainly assumed that his audience possessed both general knowledge and willingness to pay attention for whole minutes at a time worst sturges plot satirized both movie stereotypes and audience expectations those audiences for good and sufficient reasons of their own did not turn out in droves nor did they shell out much money to see unfaithfully yours the production team did their very best to avoid that dismal fate by jettisoning sturges near perfect script ruthlessly dumbing everything down and shrinking the film to fit the talents of twinkly little dudley moore rex harrison to dudley moore what a falling off was there ! harrison plays british conductor sir alfred de carter whom the script clearly expects the audience to identify with the real conductor sir thomas beecham the initial satirical thrust at audience expectations is that de carter turns out to be a super egotistical prima donna rather than the smooth lovable and yestwinkly sir thomas by a series of satisfactorily ridiculous plot developments sir alfred becomes convinced that his beautiful and much younger wife is having an affair with his assistant sir alfred has a high comedy encounter with a detective played by edgar kennedy one of the finest second bananas in movie history the detective does his level best to convince the wronged husband to ignore or forgive his wife s little failings lest he lose far more than he can ever hope to gain from shallow trifling revenge in the course of the scene it becomes clear that the detective had not taken his own advice in the past and now bitterly regrets it this is a wonderful scene and probably kennedy s last hurrah on the screen for he died shortly thereafter a perfect mixture of hilarity and wistfulness the egotist brushes aside the warnings of the detective and transforms himself into othello s younger brother before he had been over generous and almost too eloquent for belief with his loving words now he sneers and derides if he does not quite get around to demanding that his bewildered wife hand over a handkerchief it is only because time is short and he has a concert to conduct the performance begins with an overture by rossini the up tempo music puts the conductor into a manic mood and his mind turns to a plot in which he murders his wife and casts damning suspicion on his rival the elaborate machinations of the murder scheme satirize whole flocks of creakily overblown films from the bat to philo vance and the kennel murders the second selection is the music of the pilgrims from wagner s tannhaeuser a downer after rossini the conductor s imagination shifts from murderous revenge to world weary forgiveness as it satirizes the emetic nobility of films such as the often remade four feathers finally a tschaikovsky piece moves sir alfred s thoughts to grim competitiveness he will challenge his younger rival to a game of russian roulette with his wife as a reluctant witness think of about half the films made by john barrymore or doug fairbanks jr after the concert the conductor rushes off to his home to prepare for his elaborate murder scheme only to come hilariously crashing against the harsh reality of ruthlessly hostile mechanisms cheerily incomprehensible operating instructions and painfully fragile chairs in the end the conductor s wife offers an explanation that allows him to dismiss all his suspicions and return to his original state of illusionary wedded bliss with brilliant performances crackling dialogue smart plotting and fine physical gags unfaithfully yours ranks with the ladykillers kind hearts and coronets and monsieur verdoux the best of black comedies five stars idle speculations good as it is and it is very good unfaithfully yours might have been better still rex harrison however brilliant he may be in the dialogue scenes is not by any stretch of the imagination a physical comedian even though screen credit is given to a conducting coach harrison is painfully stiff as a conductor and as often as not behind the beat of the music he is supposed to be conducting and the physical comedy sequence is weakened by the obvious substitution of a stunt double from time to time not to mention the obvious fact that harrison s record player is far funnier than he is in there was an actor of the right age one who who could have gotten away with the conductor s dialogue and would unquestinably have been side splittingly funny while conducting or going two falls out of three with the demon record player charlie chaplin now that would have been something to see then there is the script the film ends on a subtly false note as unfaithfuly yours stands now linda darnell s innocent wife neatly explains away every suspicion she leaves not only her own virtue unblemished but also that of her unpleasant younger sister who throughout the film had been positioned as the eventual fall girl at the very end of the film the fully reconciled conductor and wife turn away to depart for a happy evening on the town i think that the studio or even sturges himself cut a final scene to conform to the nervous dictates of the film code i think that as the happy couple and their friends leave the hotel they were intended to pass by edgar kennedy the detective who had striven so hard to preserve the de carter marriage i think that darnell and kennedy were intended to make eye contact in shared acknowledgment that the pack of lies they had concocted to reassure sir alfred had worked then at last the conductor s straying wife would indeed have been unfaithfully his 
better of many older submarine thrillers i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine the actors well chosen the script very good and harrison ford s acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october or crimson tide whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew s attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian self sacrifice 
lawrence tierney rules yes this film feels like a diatribe it s probably less factual than the film version of john dillinger s exploits that director john milius made in the seventies so why do i recommend this film over milius more polished account well this film in a campy over thetop way is just so entertaining secondly lawrence tierney in the title role is such a magnetic screen presence his tough ferocity keeps the film s campier elements in check and grounds it in some semblance of reality there s also a good supporting cast here with gangster veterans marc lawrence and elisha cook jr seems like he s in all these noir gangster flicks on hand the story is told here crisply and in an economical minutes so if you have an hour plus to kill there s worse ways to do it oh john if only you had the two bucks to pay for the drinks ! 
good choice for light entertainment the musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when i saw it for the first time my husband is no square and he enjoyed it all seniors would love to see it again the film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd 
green equals money green infernos wage when you mess with knock off artists van damme plays the most legitimate businessman in this comical farce his partner is played by rob schneider and they sell cheap jeans after another businessman is killed van damme must find out what the problem is of course he solves everything by kicking people left and right and proclaiming were not criminals we re innocent van damme delivers another side splitting performance that was overlooked by many mortals but not this one me 
powerful movie frances is a powerful movie that tells the story of a very gifted beautiful and smart actress falling apart as she struggles to fit into the hollywood mold of her time it is not quite clear if she is suffering from mental illness of if she is just overwheled with rage and frustration for which she has no outlet but regardless like used to happen and still does at times she enters the world of the psychiatric hospital and gradually looses her freedom her life and her mind literally in the sense that at some point in the movie she is lobotomized as she endures all of this we begin to understand that frances has a very sick mother that is probably more in need of psychiatric care than her daughter the mother betrays her over and over not allowing her to be her true self denying her true needs and handling her over to the butchers at the psychiatric hospital whenever she feels that frances may be slipping away from her control this is a very sad and at times horrifying story it may not be frances farmer s true story however as it seems that she may have never had a lobotomy also it seems that she had a far bigger problem with alcoholism than was highlighted here however this does not detract from the movie which tells a story that could have been true for many people of that era lobotomy and in particular the icepick style lobotomy was practiced liberally at the time by a variety of doctors and mental health practitioners some of which did not even have any kind of surgical experience or license lobotomies of this kind apparently were administered to war veterans struggling to adjust after the traumas they endured now they would be dignosed with ptsd and treated accordingly eventually lobotomy went out of fashion as it was seen for what it was a barbaric practice that zombified people by robbing them of their essence not a cure i hope the same will be said soon of electroshock treatments that believe it or not are still used today the history of the treatement of severe mental illness is rife with horror in many ways we are still so very ignorant in these matters this is not a movie for the faint of heart however it is an important movie in many ways and jessica lange s performance is one of the best female performances i have ever seen it is worth watching this picture just to see her act a disturbing yet beautiful and powerful movie 
love the new download i wanted it for my collection however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work

streamlined way to fast toning this is an excellent tape for people who have been out of the workout zone for a while there are three levels of workouts each one lasting between min the first two are designed to build up your strength for the third one which is pretty challenging denise knows the areas that women want to work on and knows the excercises to get results i know a lot of people can t stand denise for various reasons her constant talking with that voice seems to be a big one but i find her to be informative and motivating i like how she points out the correct form and give tips while her back ups perform the excercises i ve only ever owned five pound weights but did go out and buy pound weights because a few of these excercises were a little much using the heavier ones i highly recommend this tape for people who don t have a lot of time to work out and want to see fast results in their upper body 
the original what about bob the insanity in this movie reminded me very much of the what about bob obsessive desire to manipulate the will of another human being to suit your own intentions yet in strangers on a train things are slightly stranger and more ominous instead of playful bruno anthony robert walker takes on a more intellectual and forward approach to his plans for a better life instead of staying at home he has a determination to leave the confines of his environment and pursue his goals relentlessly guy haines farley granger comes across as especially nave and more of a hopeless romantic he meets bruno anthony on a train and the story unfolds in the cleverest of ways hitchcock traps his characters behind their flaws and unveils their deepest desires which then become a reality when reality starts to become too vivid guy haines panics and tries to stop the process this only leads to one of the most terrifying carousel rides i ve ever seen in a movie and it is sheer brilliance in the making the way in which they capture the playful nature of the child riding the horses with glee as they spin about wildly and the terrified women is such a delicious contrast i can t explain why but the carousel makes the movie it is like every terrifying thing you expect happens all at once throughout the film you may feel less connection with the characters and more of a subtle fascination with what they might try next an enjoyable thriller that won t leave you biting your fingernails still it is especially intellectually enjoyable the rebecca review 
wonderful film if you like robert altman or van gogh see this movie if you like robert altman and van gogh buy this movie 
one of the funniest series of the early s for me quotget a life quot provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy from chris unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space alien in home video volume which is anything but cuddly i only wish rhino would expand its offerings of quotget a life quot episodes 
fans of woody allen will like it this was a pretty good woody allen film packed with well known celebrities woody allen is playing a novelist named harry who written books based on people he knowns he doesn t tries much to disguise them and upsets his friends with his tales there are funny moments when the movie segues to his fictional characters my favorite is the one with demi moore the one with billy crystal is pretty funny too in harry s real life i got a kick out of cookie the goodhearted prostitute 
very funny i saw this on tv and loved it so i had to buy it 
so touching i have to confess that i went to tears watching this movie and usually i don t get emotional easily it s so touching a phd professor of middle age find out that she is sick ovarian cancer it was a shock for her the doctor is talking to her and she can barely react all through the movie she looks at the camera from time to time and tell us all what she is thinking and suffering there is a brilliant young doctor yes one of those who always wants to be the first and the best no matter what with a big ego the big shot of the class who was her student in one of her literature classes it made me very angry his attitude because he was treating her in a very cold and selfish way only thinking in the results of the research i want to say that most of the doctors and scientists are not that way but once in a while you can find one of these weird specimen the nurse was nice and treated her in a better way this kind of movie makes us think about the fact that we are all just humans not matter the title or knowledge you can have and we are here to help each other no taking advantadge of each other i strongly recommend this movie just be sure to have a box of facial tissues near you 
labyrinth fantasy and fun the labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy this has always been one of my favorite films and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more jennifer connelly gives a superb performance as sarah the main character whose baby brother is taken by the goblin king david bowie in one of his best characters who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time he wrote and performed all the music which is also some of his best work sarah must leave her world of make believe and enter the very real and deceptive labyrinth to save her brother in time before he s turned into a goblin along the way we encounter a large cast of jim henson s puppet creatures some of which become sarah s friends and helpers in her journey the puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people the movie is filled with magic both on and off screen the film is supplemented on this dvd with a makingof documentary an original feature narrated largely by jim henson himself made during the actual production of the film released in such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are what goes into their creation how they operate and how they interact with the sets and other characters especially in this case with the live actors it s a lot of fun to see this inside look and more than anything gives a real sense of who jim henson was and how much this all really meant to him my favorite quote from jim henson in this documentary was when he said about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie when i go see a film when i leave the theater i like to be happier than i was when when i went in i like to leave with an up feeling and i like a picture to have a sense of substance to be about life and the things that matter to me a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age lighthearted fun fantastical funny beautiful exciting and more real than many of today s realities extremely enjoyable and uplifting as an added bonus monty python member terry jones wrote the script and is interviewed in the documentary cheryl mcfadden star trek tng s beverly crusher also did all the choreography in the film for both humans and puppets 
rock you like a hurricane just like katrina in new orleans it s better than i expected i thought of this animation movie following the cult hit of the same name of julie strain is the muse that has inspired the animators for creating the heroine of this movie and any film with julie in it even as a cartoon clone is worth all your time trust me the story is nothing particular but it s fun to watch there is also a good heavy metal score that prevades the movie beware it s bloody politically uncorrect and with a few nude scenes 
odd film that is hard to stop watching this seems more an experience than a film i felt more of a voyeur peering into someone s private life than watching a film most likely this is a symptom of hollywood film conditioning which this film is not this film is unexpected and subtly jarring it moves slow like a heartbeat i kept waiting for each pulse until finally it ended good for a quiet night to give a warm buzz nice performance by daniel auteuil and others that stands out from other parts watch the film aprs vous as a nice contrast and to cheer you up a bit after 
into the night i owned this film on vhs for years and when it mysteriously disappeared i ordered it on dvd it s a sort of cult film with an amazing array of cameos and is one of my favorites it s quite violent in spots but i like the story and michelle pfeiffer and jeff goldblum are excellent i loved the ending which i won t spoil for you simply put if you like a good suspenseful yarn with a lot of action you ll love it too 
funny memories i first saw this movie with my husband when we were only dating as teens we really enjoyed it then and i have been looking for it since i was happy to have found it and enjoyed the funny memories it brought back love seeing zero and the other old actors some of the music especially everybody ought to have a maid gets pleasantly stuck in my head 
how do i play the royal life i love the movie ! i just have one problem i can t seem to be able to play the royal life from disc i put it in my computer and clicked on the royal life and it just gives me a summary of what it s about and then tells me to insert the dvd rom does someone know how to do this 
you don t like movies if you don t like this after watching this movie one friday night i immediately watched it again did i just see that was my initial reaction a fantastic film that sticks with you for weeks initially rented from a local blockbuster before purchasing it via amazon i watched it over times before returning it back i loved the cat stevens soundtrack and it makes me sad that there is no harold and maude soundtrack that has all of the songs especially tea for the tillerman you appreciate the brilliant directing and although it has been considered creepy it is never truly unsettling but rather it makes you examine how you add value to life and for myself created ways to be maude alicous 
joe pendelton says evelyn keyes good rita johnson bad january a wonderful wonderful motion picture very happy to see that this terrific film will finally be struck to dvd but please sony correct the cover art faux pas that has plagued this great film since its vhs release the actress pictured next to robert montgomery should be evelyn keyes but is not instead actress rita johnson is pictured rita johnson played the part of the murdering adulteress wife of bruce farnsworth montgomery in the flim this art was obviously created or selected by someone who has never viewed this fine film or the very beautiful evelyn keyes please sony correct this miscue before this dvd s february release date

brian regan first heard his stand up on cd when i worked at borders a few years back sometimes he gets a bit carried away a lotta comics tend to though and his comedy comes across dopey yet easy to relate to clean no naughty words or uncouth situations here ! family fun comedy dirty or clean as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well then he she is funny in my eyes 
golden oldie in the days of the arcades there was a good movie that came out and funny enough had a great arcade game called krull now mind you i really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it when i was a whole bunch younger just saw the bladed glaive and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie including those terrible scifi d d movies ugh it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the slayers and from then on its a totally different experience with such ultimate favorites as the emerald seer the widow of the web and the cyclops and of course the shapeshifting a bit daft too wizard with some very strange habits i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come pros cool effects for the time good story well done plot and themescons may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough but remember it is a tad old its a star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great 
good spy story if you have ever worked for a government bureaucracy and you keep up with history and current evets this movie will bear out greater believeability than the more popular blockbuster spy movies got to be watching it for the story itself though there are no massive explosions intense car chases hot sex scenes etc 
chaplin at work i remember sitting in front of my television rapturously watching the documentary hollywood created by kevin brownlow and david gill in each of the segments dealing with a specific part of early hollywood history played on pbs and was a true delight in this era before dvd and even vhs it was a great way to see a large number of rare clips from the silent era a few years later they made unknown chaplin perhaps the most astonishing documentary ever created about the technical side of hollywood a few years later buster keaton a hard act to follow continued the tradition unknown chaplin was just released on dvd and is a must have addition for anyone even remotely interested in the history of film or filmmaking during production of hollywood brownlow and gill naturally wanted to devote an entire hour to chaplin but ran into a roadblock the person who controlled access to chaplin s work was only prepared to let them use a snippet they had to change their plans they couldn t build an entire hour around a snippet after hollywood aired to great critical acclaim they tried again chaplin s widow allowed them access to his personal vault what they found there astonished them row after row of film cans many labeled with city lights the gold rush the circus and many with unfamiliar names these contained clips never before seen projects started but never finished and rehearsals for films like city lights it was a treasure trove for any film historian naturally they believed they had just hit the mother load but soon met a man named raymond rohauer rohauer a film collector claimed to have many reels of film from chaplin s mutual days the period immediately before chaplin went independent and began to make his great feature length films the mutual period is considered by many to be chaplin s best when he made his most famous two reelers the immigrant the cure and others along with the kid as they viewed this footage brownlow and gill made a major realization chaplin worked out all of his films on the set while the cameras were rolling providing a visual history of his work beginning with a bare outline he would began production working out jokes on set adding jokes changing stories and more sometimes he would scrap everything and start over or get an idea and change everything around and the camera was always running while he did this unknown chaplin premiered in to great critical acclaim exposing many to the methods used by one of film s greatest comedians and most skilled directors imagine having the ability to watch claude monet create a canvas and get insight into the various decisions he made or to watch frank lloyd wright work on his latest design and see why he decided to put that piece of word there this is what unknown chaplin provides access into the mind of a master recently released on dvd for the first time each of the three segments of unknown look amazingly vivid and clear some of the better footage is so clear it looks like it was photographed yesterday as james mason narrates guiding us we begin to learn how chaplin created his films every time i say this i just get chills up and down my spine how often can we expect to see a master someone at the top of their craft creating some of their most famous work considering how much of the silent era was destroyed the fact that this film exists at all is all the more impressive part one is the most groundbreaking presenting the footage from the mutual days brownlow and gill quickly realized that chaplin filmed every take and frequently changed bits between takes how should they deal with this wealth of material they decided to arrange the clips in chronological order recreating how chaplin worked on the material as the cameras rolled he began each project with an outline but this is by no means how the projects were completed he would work out the jokes and funny business on set sometimes running into road blocks if he couldn t work through it he would scrap everything and start over we get to see this process as we watch these clips unearthed by the filmmakers part two presents the material obtained from chapin s vaults after he became independent and began making feature length films less extensive the footage still reveals a lot for instance a family friend stood near the camera and was able to take home movies as chaplin worked on city lights this footage is shown and we get a glimpse of chaplin the director at work we also watch as chaplin works through various location problems with the gold rush unused footage from the circus and more part three shows us the unseen clips portions of abandoned projects unseen shorts and more brownlow and gill found in the chaplin vaults after chaplin built his own studio many dignitaries and famous people stopped by and the director filmed these visits sometimes making quick shorts with them on existing sets if he did any funny business during these impromptu films he frequently incorporated this into later works he even started a few projects that were never finished one of which shows charlie as a down onhisluck professor who owns a flea circus temporarily abandoning his tramp character unknown chaplin is a documentary almost solely devoted to the filmmaker s work the few references to his personal life are made because they somehow affected his professional work because of this unknown presents one of the most thorough interesting and illuminating looks at one of film s true masters and true pioneers 
mrswlj facts about bulls t what most people fail to realize is that most life story movies are not made for the purpose of glorification to the viewer but to let them know of the real life trials and tribulations of that person how can you criticise someones life story to go threw what they went threw to see what they saw and to experience life threw times when life was almost impossible to grasp i think josephine baker was a very great person regardless of her nationality anyone with the guts to live life to the fullest and overcome impossible barriers deserves much praise 
alright ladies lets play the name game reform school girls is an over the top woman in prison cult classic that is fun fun fun to watch i watched this movie s of times growing up in the mid s and it still pleases today wendy o williams is completely mesmerizing to watch although her acting is pretty bad to say the least still the film manages to entertain with its completely unbelievable premise i love this movie pat ast and wendy o williams make this movie what it is and why sybil danning got the dvd cover i ll never know shes barely in the film pat and wendy both who have since passed make great villains though and are thoroughly enjoyable to watch over and over again if you like low budget entertaining prison films with lots of women violence nudity then you will love reform school girls the soundtrack is pretty awesome too and showcases w ows real talent as a musician and performer check out the dvd commentary ! it s pretty funny and entertaining to listen to ! 
not a dull moment in this movie i am so glad that leonard malton s poor review didn t keep me from purchasing this movie i loved it it will keep you on the edge of your seat at all times although the subject matter is a difficult one it is something that exists and i thought the movie did a good job of telling the story of a female fbi agent debra winger who infiltrates a white supremacist group to investigate a murder it s too bad this movie didn t get better reviews by the critics i found it to be better than most ! excellent acting and directing well worth it 
harlem a jungle inside a city harlem is the sinister landscape where every man has to survive according his basic insticts there s no time for redemption there s no way out for your elusive dreams in many ways this film is very close in spirit to carlito s way where any man can be able to escape from his past this movie is a potent noir but viewed from the opposite side of the street if spike lee captured all our attention about the strong tension among italian and niggers empire about the distribution and sell of angel s dust and other candies the film gets out from the simple anecdote and returns over and over about the fatality that hovers all this family mother and father have been destroyed and two brothers build an empire from the ashes of the fatal addictions superbly narrated marvelously acted with fluid camera work and firm direction highly recommended 
the last but not the least un flic is the latest film of jean pierre melville the famous french director of the s and s it s the last but not the least this film shows particularily well the style of the master which is very sensitive to the nights and gangsters atmosphere as it was the case for the samura and for the red circle or the army of shadows the story is brilliant and the thrill upon the characters is so high that the viewer feels in alain delon is excellent as usual catherine deneuve and richard crenna appears in mysterious roles you won t regret to buy this vhs because melville is now considered as a master for directors like john woo quentin tarantino or even martin scorcese 
download worked for me but would like linux support the download process worked as advertised i have a megabit s dsl connection but the download still took more than an hour for a minute episode i was able to watch the movie on a windows xp machine unfortunately i mostly use linux machines and it does not seem possible to view these files under linux for this i subtract a star from the rating regarding the story it is a fun story which is better than the usual nickelodeon fare

as good as it gets usually sequels are not as good as the original films they follow one need only think of sayjawsto get this point but with the two jakes the sequel to chinatownthe sequel is every bit as good as the original the film follows the main charecter from chinatowndetective jake gittes who has a new and disturbing case that has threads reaching back into time and inter connecting with the original plotline many of the stars from the original reprise thier roles most notably jack nicholson who also directed at the time of its original theatrical release the critics were not kind to the film or to the director starperhaps this was to have been expected inasmuchas chinatownranks high on the list of best ever filmson the other hand most professional film critics are not only herd animals who too often follow one another s lead like dogs sniffing each other s rear ends but have little regard for what the public thinks if one or two famouscritics get a bug up thier backsides about a film it is a sure bet that the rest afraid of being contrary will follow suit alsohaving to sit through films of all sorts make these people jaded they expect novelty and are disappointed by stories directionactingect that the rest of us find quite entertaining and most professional critics seem to find the most obscure often foreign films to be spectacular while most normal people do not as if cutting edge films about saythree men who have hernias and like bowling together on friday nights offers the very zenith of acting and film making achievement so forget what the professional critics might have thought about the two jakes it was a dandy film you won t be disappointed 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography 
surprisingly very good sean penn keeps popping up everywhere i turn he s like an infectious disease that won t stop he wasn t in his place in the interpreter but here in a bit role in the weight of water he s right at home catherine mccormack does another good job did i mention that it helps that she s amazingly hot and elizabeth hurley is oh so hot i can t believe they put both of those women in the same film right now those of you who are women or those men who are sissified are probably bored to tears well i m not done so give me one more minute of your hectic day please the plot flips back and forth between the past and the present mccormack s character a photojournalist is unraveling a hundred year old crime while watching her poet husband sean penn lust over another woman hurley on a boating outing well as our protagonist digs deeper and deeper into the old crime she begins to lose control on reality seeing herself in the same situation as one of the possible killers from the unsolved mystery good acting and a story that slowly engulfs plus two incredible british hotties and a role that actually makes sean penn look great what more do you need

i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
one of the greatest episodes this was one of stargate sg s funniest episode ever you get to finally see the furlings for the first time too bad it took episodes and too bad they may not be real if you re a science fiction fan you ll love the burns that go around in this episode especially the star trek and farscape burns which were hilarious this is the perfect th episode for those loyal fans that stood by and watched every episode for the last decade 
this movie is soooooo awesome hilary did a great job in the movie she played lizzie and isabella great she looked great with brown hair i liked how lizzie and isabella sang together at first i thought she actually had a twin but hey this is a great movie you will love it 
forgotten s hiding out has been hiding out from the funny s teen flicks it has been lost in between the brat pack and john hughes finest but it is just as corny funny as the rest of them jon cryer plays andrew a stockbroker running for his life from the mob and the feds who are attempting to protect him after narrowly escaping from the mob andrew assumes a new identity in a new town what is not planned ahead is the fact that he will be a high schooler again the interactions with teachers fellow students love interests and his dorky cousin patrick make this movie quality for the genre it belongs in good soundtrack and memorable quotes round out this lost flick 
the boy i want to see adams butt 
when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
very interesting audition isn t your typical horror movie but like japanese fashion the movie gives a lot of detail and may be confusing to some people who aren t used to dream sequences explaining some of the story i was overall impressed with the pacing and style of the movie but i was a little disappointed to learn that one of my favorite parts of the movie wasn t in the original novel this movie was based on credit goes to miike the director for the new ideas that were added to the story in this movie because the scenes that miike added were probably the best parts the biggest complaint i have of the movie is that the cameraman in some scenes couldn t keep the camera steady and it is shaky in a few parts nothing major but it is enough to notice the picture not being steady the special features for the dvd are a great addition and answer some questions about the movie mainly when they interview the author of the novel i don t know if this could be considered a horror movie it is definitely more of a suspense story the author of the novel ryu himself said that this isn t a ghost story or about a maniac with a knife but more about the dark side of the human heart it s not until the last few minutes of the movie when things get really bad most of the time it is like a normal love story with a twist if you like thriller suspense stories like psycho that deal with the outcome from years of abuse then you will like this movie but if you want a slasher that goes for the throat this isn t for you because this story builds up to the moment instead of going straight for the jugular remember the movie isn t what i d call scary but more disturbing than anything else and it doesn t become that until the last twenty minutes then you can bet you will hold on to your seats and you are glued to the tv 
awesome abs this video offers a great ab workout i ve already worn out two videos and i am now on my third tape i ve used this video for over eight years and never get bored the exercises are always effective even after all these years i really appreciate tamilee s knowledge and experience 
the definitive kieslowski for most viewers three colours was the entry point into kieslowski s approach to cinema a flair for ambiguity challenges to morals and intimate camera work were quirkily matched to sensual and sexual dilemnas but if this was arthouse cinema from the chic end of town all parisian glamour and buzz it was the gritty if not grimey northern sensibility of the commandments that is kieslowski s mid s masterwork the lighting throughout seems contaminated by acid rain theres a dense macabre atmosphere by turns flicking from pathos to brutality with the ease of a tale from the grimms it s these beguiling episodes so economically shot that earned him the acclaim and rights to be mentioned in the top tier bergman pasolini tarkovsky dreyer bresson the coiterie that pose the big questions with authoritive magnificence and allow their cameras to suck away at the world s textures this dvd has a useful interview with kieslowski who acknowledges the pivotal role of his long and fecund association with legal eagle piesiewicz he is astonishigly candid with the assembled polish intelligensia while scathing of their lack of useful critique adored outside his coutry reviled or too challenging within the cast throughout are uniformly excellent the children are astonishingly good in very demanding roles reviewers have their favourites and i concur with those who rate episodes where the camera eye hauntingly tunnels its way to the inexorable gallows scene and but this is only to place them as scintillating if such sombre themes can be so deemed rather than merely excellent in the introduction american critic ebert whips through the stock praise for the director with minimal insight for acquainted viewers he s right though about the emphasis kieslowski gives to the face the episodes rebound on you and doubtless like me you ll enjoy replaying these brilliantly filmed urban tales for years to come 
jon rules jon bon jovi proves he is multi talented we know or you should know he s a fantastic singer and he demonstrates a pretty good acting ability in this vampire flick in this movie he is a white mans version of blade as he seeks vampires to kill good cast of characters was assembled and a decent storyline 
the real jesus this film reveals a jesus far different than the serious and detached version one usually sees in other films in this four hour word forword account of matthew bruce marchiano remarkably portrays jesus as who he was a first century jewish man compassionatelovinggivingsorrowfuljoyfulreal even his appearance was real weather beaten slightly dirty tunic hair flying i highly recommend this film you ll fall in love with this jesus i understand that bruce has plans to produce the gospel according to john but needs support i hope he gets it because we need another film as real and as good as matthew 
season stargate atlantis is great i like the idea of downloading the episodes but put in all the seasons why leave out season 
poker players only there seems to be mixed reviews about this movie one either likes it or has very little if any response i m a poker player and i loved the story and the cast is excellent if you like poker as well as suspense i believe this film will be very satisfying to you if you don t fit that description it s still worth a look

fall in behind the major you can read all about the behind things that went on during the making of this movie so lets talk about the movie itself i remember watching this movie as a child and loving it i know that this isn t what peckinpah wanted us to see but even in the form most of us have seen it the talent and strong direction make even this flawed masterpiece one of the great westerns and great movies period now after all these years they have found the missing scenes and we can see at least as close as possible the epic western that sam wanted with these new scenes soundtracksam hated the old one and using his notes the movie comes alive again and even better than before now if you are like me i loved the old soundtrack yes it s corny and i hate to say it but i do love it not to worry as you can choose which one you would like to hear with extras glore this is one of the better extended version discs out there nothing is over looked and now major dundee can take its place beside the wild bunch as one of the best films peckinpah made ! 
very funny but not an academy award winner this is one of those side splitting movies that really doesn t get much credit becuase it s not taken seriously it s a real laugh and great if you re in the mood for comedy and can appreciate it based only on it s entertainment value 
heartwarming john wayne john ford classic ! now on dvd all the positive comments you read here about this film are true this classic western stars john wayne pedro armendariz and harry carey jr along with a great supporting cast lead by ward bond the usual john ford suspects ford strikes a balance between action and sentimentality directing this simple story in a straightforward fashion with a great sense of style this is ford s first color film and cinematography by winton c hoch looks really really rich and with enough sand to make you wish you had some lemonade duke really shines in this film just watch those expressions restored to its original pristine mm real technicolor glory godfathers is a natural for the christmas season this heartwarming drama is a gritty tender timeless classic a film the whole family can watch this sleeper film in the wb mgm catalog was way w a y overdue on dvd in the us but here it is most welcomed and highly recommended ! ive revised my original review to reflect this title s availability on dvd released with zero fanfare i was first aware of its release when i saw a newspaper ad for it one week before christmas 
dated but hasn t lost its touch this is no reflection on the quality of the film but sleep with me loses its edge after ten years it s full of witty s style banter this was a great film when romantic comedies were in the actors were hilarious and i enjoyed craig sheffer for the first time ever i don t watch a lot of his films but this one is entertaining i saw it in and was hooked on it then since then my tastes have changed and i ve gotten attached to other films this is the perfect date movie providing a realistic comedic look at the differences between women and men and the problems that can surface within a circle of friends 
powder i loved this quirky movie i am glad to have it on dvd 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods 
a forgotten and overlooked dramatic gem i picked up a prayer for the dying on a whime one day i have always liked mickey rourke and i think he is one of the most underrated actors int he business i never heard of this film before and bought it and not knowing how good it would be upon viewing the film i couldn t help thinking how much better this movie could have been mickey rourke gives an absolutly moving performance as a hit man wanting to give up his evil ways i know that that has been used as a plot for a hundred movies but this is easily one of the better of those films some people bob hoskins as miscast int he role of the priest but i found him to also give a good performance overall i was very moved by the film i only wish it went a little more in depth with bob hoskins character it gives hints that he and mickey rourke s character are much alike but doesn t go into real depth i have also heard that mickey rourke was upset with the final result of the film though it could have been much better it still comes off as a very good dramatic piece of cinema this film is a great way to spend a saturday afternoon 
classic comedy is still great i love this film ! the cast s comic timing is so good you ll be doubled over laughing ! the dvd could use an upgrade though as funny as this movie is it is amazing how bad the sequel turned out ! lightning in a bottle the first time i guess 
first rate mystery thriller that floors you with real shocks a group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel where one by one they begin to disappear sounds familiar but promising while the promise is more than fulfilled though the familiarity is not as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist filled movies around it s astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out regarding its genuinely shocking ending i had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its dvd release ! even with advance knowledge of the outcome though it was still astounding i can only imagine how jaw dropping it must be to witness it not knowing fantastic suspense great characterization as played by a cast of well knowns including john cusack amanda peet rebecca demornay and ray liotta excellent production values and total non telegraphing of the plot combine to make identity one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time if you don t know the ending do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible the turns are some of the most unexpected ever even if you do know the gist of it don t hesitate to see it it ll still deliver many times over indispensable for fans of mystery drama horror or thrillers 
heathcliff do come to me to me heathcliff is one of the most complex and compelling characters ever written and i had once thought that any actor would fall short in playing him in a film or miniseries having watched this beautiful and haunting adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time i have to say that ralph fiennes has more than succeeded in bringing the aforementioned anti hero to life emily bronte would have been proud everyone who has read wuthering heights knows about the tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and how he becomes a dark brooding manipulative diabolical man who takes his revenge on the people who he feels have wronged him and torn him away from cathy including her daughter and his own child and ward fiennes brings out heathcliff s many conflicting emotions flawlessly and his performance floored me juliette binoche as cathy linton catherine earnshaw is great as well the supporting cast is quite splendid too no cardboard cutout performances here ! the backdrop of the moors is beautiful and gothic just like bronte described them in her book i am very impressed with this adaptation i haven t seen the film adaptation or the miniseries from masterpiece theater yet but i wonder if they come close to this wonderful film the bbc will produce an adaptation some time next year and i think that richard armitage north and south would make a wonderful heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances to his acting in the meantime i shall treasure this one and watch it over and over again 
ginger takes center stage dvd review in this eighth installment of fred ginger films ginger displays her talents not only as a dancer but also as an actress and a singer she performs all three simultaneously in the yam she causes mischief while under the hypnotic influence of tony flagg fred astaire throwing sticks and dinner rolls breaking glass driving erratically and shooting skeet the psychiatry is definitely unconventional but it is a comedy after all the slow motion dancing in the dream sequence is very smooth and kind of cool a running joke where aunt cora luella gear keeps telling judge joe travers clarence kolb to sit down adds a couple of more laughs typecasting prevails here look for hattie mcdaniel gone with the wind playing a maid here too in the vintage short public jitterbug no a group of feds is out to catch jitterbug dancer the tap dancing is superb the cigarette and match eating routine is a neat trick run time in the wb cartoon september in the rain the labels of packaged goods in a general store come to life and perform a written preface comments on how racist it is however the stereotyping did not bother me and i would not have even noticed if they did not point it out nevertheless i am glad they were sensitive about it run time note no featurette running commentary or theatrical trailer is on this dvd which is why i gave it four stars instead of five 
taking care of business taking care of business is one of the funniest movies that i have seen it s my all time favorite 
too spooky for my taste the now standard indiana formula is there and there are a lot of fun parts to this movie however the bad guys are too bad and the situation is too spooky be sure to watch riders of the lost ark first even thought this takes place chronologically earlier once again james bond has nothing on dr jones harrison ford as he negotiates for a treasure and is double crossed at every turn barely escaping with his life also the acquisition of a steriotipical blond singer wilhelmina scott kate capshaw and his new sidekick short round jonathan ke quan in his hasty retreat he does not realize that there are greater forces at work insuring that he fulfill his destiny to recover a sacred object and all the children of a beleaguered village is he up to the challenge in this case does being blond help or hinder will short shot prove that size does not matter take heart be prepared for a dark passage a little too dark for my taste 
a few holes in the story but other than that this is by no means a bad film it s a good look at life for black southerners in the pre integration days al freeman who one cannot stop thinking of as elijah muhammad after the malcolm x movie is quite good as the kind of strong and wise patriarchs once common but sadly missing in today s black america this is essentially a series of vignettes about a young boy s life from to in mississippi but the vignettes do not flow well together and the story is full of holes how did the uncle get into passing out voter registration flyers what happened to uncle cleve after the boycott what happened to the boy s father how did the grandfather explain the kkk to his grandson after the encounter etc etc i guess once ould have to read the book for all this which i certainly will but that aside it s fine viewing 
a classic piece of hokiness i like everything batman except for the sequels that followed the movie and this is one of the best incarnations though it looks cheesy by todays standards that s really what they were shooting for back in i loved the bonus features and especially the commentary by adam west and burt ward who let the viewers know that they also were nt taking this seriously my favorite is when batman and robin are trying to separate the dehydrated dust and are wearing doctors masks and aprons and adam west says look at these two idiots also if the execs at fox are reading these reviews please please please on hands and knees release the show on dvd ! 
lots of funny moments make a great movie bill murray proves that he can direct as well and a first rate supporting cast including tv s monk tony shalhoub and kirkwood smith from that s show jason robards plays the policeman trying to catch quade murry and davis who have robbed a bank the bank job is inspired but every attempt to leave the town end in a comic riot i won t say more since we don t want to give it away it is inspired lunacy and very much worth your while buy i 
you bring me peace in a time of war okay philadelphia what can be said about it when i first seen it i was moved and it made me think while watching the opera scene tom s funeral and seeing him as a child not only those both scenes made the movie but made me think about god he looked so innocent happy and how scary it is to grow up in a world so cold unkind also the opera scene gave me goosebumps as tom hank explain what the arist was talking about how beautifull and emotional was watching denzels reaction neil young s philadelphia is possibly one of the most beautifull song i ve ever heard it realy brought me peace if you decide to rent philadelphia think about what i said and also how truly beautifull antonio hanks relationship was with so much love and how sad was for antonio miguel knowing that his bestfriend lover and companion could die at any moment sigh just watch it 
story of flint presaged what has happened since michael moore s first major film was one of his best in my opinion for two reasons first off since he did not yet have a trademark style he did not try to go over the top in this film as much as he does in his subsequent efforts he does his normal routine of tracking people down in an effort to embarrass them by asking them pointed questions but for most of the film he lets the story and the citizens of flint do the talking as you probably already know this is the story of moore s hometown flint michigan and the utter despair that fell upon it after gm began shuttering auto plants under the supervision of then ceo roger smith the film really highlights how clueless flint s elite are as to the suffering that all of this consolidation is causing at one point in the film moore is talking to some wealthy people at a party who seem to think they are doing the unemployed some kind of favor by hiring them to act as living statues at one of their fetes when he asks the partygoers about what is going on in flint they seem somewhat offended that there is such negative publicity circulating and say there should be more emphasis on the positive things going on in flint they name the symphony and the opera ah yes let them eat opera glasses ! the second reason i consider this film to be one of moore s best is that even though this film was made in it is still interesting and relevant today this is because the contrast between what average working people have to endure the struggle to find secure jobs with decent benefits and their increasing vulnerability and the desire of the captains of industry to improve the bottom line at any cost as long as it doesn t cost them has only worsened and deepened over the last years since this film was first made 
pink not blue one of the better old comedies that cary grant is true blue even if his sub isn t 
words can t express the pleasure i have enjoyed this film many times and am gratified to see that warner home video finally sees fit to release it on dvd it will be part of my dvd collection when released however i m going to wait briefly before i buy it and this is why as you know boys town began in omaha nebraska since then they ve changed their name to girls boys town and have expanded to include a number of facilities in many locations but sadly two of those facilities were located in louisiana and they were both damaged or destroyed by the fury of hurricane katrina currently the organization is asking for funding to help feed and clothe the children and volunteers who are now refugees in san antonio texas but since i knew of this dvd release i sent an email to the public relations department of girls boys town i suggested they contact warner to see if a partnership could be arranged if warner was willing to donate part of the proceeds from this dvd sale to katrina relief for the organization s louisiana facilities and if the public was made aware of this it might serve to spur both pre orders and general sales of the dvd not only benefiting warner and dvd retailers like amazon but also benefiting this worthy organization now desperately in need of help i also suggested that they tell warner something else the timing of this dvd release being so close to katrina s devastation may not be just a coincidence a partnership between warner and girls boys town may be god s will 
the intersection of film fact and genius unforgettable at its core this is a film about what happens when a person defies the system any system it is the true story of frances farmer a beautiful smart and rebellious movie star of the s who seemed to have it all because of her many advantages the system took a while catching up to her maybe that s where the fury and vengeance originated payback required more than a pound of flesh the system wanted her spirit her intellect and her soul the portrayal of psychiatry as practiced in those days is unlike anything you will see anywhere else it makes cuckoo s nest look like a vacation in tuscany indeed psychiatry in this film is less a healing force than a means of preserving social order and conformity jessica lange deserved the oscar for this role that she didn t get it is a crime this is a solo masterpiece performance easily on a par with streep in sophie s choice lange has the beauty intelligence sophistication and edge to play this complicated woman and she throws herself into the part fearlessly from saucy starlet oozing coy charm to radical intellectual hanging with lefties in nyc to belligerent scrapper knocking heads with studio moguls to star crossed lover inviting disaster and betrayal the way others invite friends over to dinner to self destructive victim descending into the darkness of booze and pills to adult infant manipulated by a fiercely controlling mother to psychiatric patient abused for sport and disassembled lange shifts through facets like she s driving a porsche on a country road you never notice her changing gears every minute of the ride is thrilling the best thing about this film apart from lange is that is shows it doesn t tell the viewer is left to interpret without heavy handed moralizing the truth of frances farmer s life is so fascinating and bizarre that simply bringing it to the screen is more than enough few of us have had the experience of being involuntarily committed to a mental hospital much less lobotomized but all of us have tried to thwart the system at one point or another and paid for it every viewer can applaud farmer s irreverence and idealism even when it s naive and feel sorrow when she must confront the cruel consequences this is a dark movie not all hollywood lives have happy endings but it is a true movie frances takes you places you have never gone and can barely imagine jessica lange delivers the performance of lifetime not just her lifetime anybody s lifetime

competition this is a good cartoon for competition with rocket robin hood hope they come to quick agreable turms msp didnt see the black wolf or fox 
it is all a lie although it might seem like an odd starting point the first time i heard of kurosawa s rashomon was when i read iris chang s rape of nanking for the first time a few years ago within this book she alluded to the film because of the various stories detailing the atrocities committed in nanking differed greatly depending on the source of information anyway a couple of years after that i read akutagawa ryuunosuke s short story rashomon and noticed that it really did not fit chang s brief description of the movie and it was not until i read a later short story in the collection in the grove did i find the actual short story the film was based on the film rashomon was western film audiences first real exposure to the films of kurosawa akira and it ignited the flame of interest in kurosawa s films for decades to come and with good reason because rashomon is truly an excellent film and it still tops best films ever made lists constantly during a terrible rainfall three men a priest a woodcutter and a bandit duck into the ruins of the rashomon gate to escape the massive downpour the priest and the woodcutter have just returned from a court case detailing the murder of a samurai by the bandit tajomaru listening to tajomaru s testimony it seems like a pretty cut and dry case he wanted the samurai s wife for his own and after raping her he killed her husband as she asked him to do however after listening to the wife s story and even the dead husband s story through a medium it is hard to say what the truth isthe old saying goes history is written by the victors and rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view the same events but how lies thread their way into the truth and corrupt it kurosawa depicts the scene with the samurai his wife and the bandit tajomaru four times within the film s minutes and the resulting juxtaposition is quite enjoyable

where s the party at if all you have ever seen of mark dacascos is his villanous role in cradle the grave then drive is as good a place as any to see him as the hero it ranks up with only the strong redemption kickboxer and brotherhood of the wolf as mark s one of if not the best of mark s films drive is often compared to jackie chan s rush hour while it s clear that drive is greatly influenced by jackie chan s hong kong pics i found it more comparable to chill factor the story begins as our hero toby wong mark dacascos arrives in san francisco from hong kong attempting to escape his slavery to a hong kong assassin ring he has a bioengine inside his chest that greatly inhances his physicality and has learned that he can earn million from an american coporation to is interested in buying the chip naturally wong s superiors don t want this and have sent some goons after him wong kidnaps malik brody kadeem hardison to drive him to l a and insures malik s cooperation by offering a cut drive takes the best parts of jackie chan s movies and shows them to an american audience for example the lengthy brawl in the motel garage i found reminiscent of the auto test center finale in twin dragons also the excellent final match between mark and masaya kato follows the jackie chan tradition of the fighters being so evenly matched that their duel goes back and forth to the point where you just don t know who will win even mark plowing an opponent down on a motorcycle is something of a tradition in kung fu movies its been seen in police story rapid fire in the line of duty iv etc and the comedy in drive in every way matches the action so do yourself a favor and check out drive for kadeem hardison s comedy and mark dacascos fists of fury 
good movie if you like fantasy movies with a good bit a drama added in then you ll like this one i really liked it i d watch it two or three times in a year time period and i d watch it again the next day if the right person was with me

the ties that bind and break roger michell s the mother ranks with cries and whispers and long day s journey into night as one of the most unpleasant profoundly disturbing portraits of a dysfunctional family ever put on film it is also undeniably brilliant at showing the frayed knots of family loyalty that only need one good shock to break irrevocably hanif kureishi an old hand at making audiences squirm tells the story of may anne reid a sixtyish housewife in a semi rural english town visiting her children in london with her husband toots peter vaughan ten minutes into the movie toots dies leaving may totally at a loss as the film makes plain from the beginning may s life has revolved entirely for decades around caring for toots at first we think the film will be a poignant study of a woman s grief may doesn t want to go back to her empty house but her children plainly don t want her around her son bobby steven mackintosh is a cold self centered businessman and her daughter paula cathryn bradshaw is a needy whining neurotic who blames her mother for nearly everything that s gone wrong with her life we think the story will be about may s learning to stand up for herself and make a new life when bobby asks may not to be difficult she stiffens and asks why shouldn t i be difficult but then may meets darren daniel craig paula s sexy moody boyfriend and a man half may s age and from then on all expectations fly straight out the window and land with a crash i wish the publicity for the film didn t reveal what happens between may and darren but even so the impact of it assaults the audience like the punch in the face paula eventually gives may if the movie were just about an elderly woman s sexuality it wouldn t be so shocking what shocks is may s selfish betrayal of paula and the brutal fashion in which paula discovers it at that moment we lose all our moorings as an audience and have no idea who among the characters to side with if anyone we still have sympathy for may as we don t for the patently hateful paula darren and bobby but we also gasp in horror at her heedless behavior and get an idea why her children turned out the way they did the mother is hard to sit through and also hard to forget 
tremendous put a lot of sex in it that s always nice lorenzo protagonist of this film is advised about his novel inprogress sex and lucia which contains stories within stories within stories unpacks this claim showing that sex is not always nice but that like narrative it can be liberating and transformative tragedy and betrayal lie at this film s heart but because its story bends and twists around as it follows lorenzo s false starts and revelations as a writer it has as it explains a hole at the center which the audience like the characters can fall through it also offers a way out a way to distinguish voyeurism and pornography from love and art a way to stay faithful to a vision of human trust and imagination brilliantly accomplished sex and lucia displays the loveliness and ample talent of its stars especially the beautiful paz vega as lucia and tristan ulloa as lorenzo a tremdous film 
one of drew s best films this film is totally under rated it is suspensful and keeps you guessing if you like mystery this is pretty good and drew did a good job on it it s not her typical work but she is such a good actress

winona ryder s best film to date a film about teens plagued with mean spiritedness and revenge on their minds ends up being one of the best films of the s one of the most darkest comedies with envious contempt evil at its core yet deliciously irrisistable the whole cast is sensational especially ryder who still says in interviews today this is personally her favorite film she has done in her career 
a real treat of a movie and an important one as well the firemen s ball is one of a handful of czech films that defined the quotnew wave quot era and had a profound influence on filmmakers and critics around the world other important films of this period include forman s quotloves of a blonde quot jiri menzel s quotclosely watched trains quot and quotlarks on a string quot a menzel film that hasn t been released on dvd to my knowledge but firemen s ball is a personal favorite probably due to the fact that i lived in the czech republic for five years and attended similar village balls the characters in this wicked satire are portrayed with humor affection and above all a level of realism that remains unsurpassed in the end forman does what he does best he leaves you torn between laughter and tears this film is a must see especially for those who are interested in understanding how filmmaking evolved in the s

the first suitcase bomb in film wow what a movie ! this robert aldrich film is way ahead of its time not only in terms of subject matter but stylistically shot in shadowy black and white scenes are displayed at angles with an almost dizzying effect the film was supposedly very influential on the french new wave directors of the early sixties and i can see why it is a detective story based upon a mickey spillane novel with ralph meeker playing mike hammer the detective i had never seen ralph meeker in any sort of role other than a supporting one paths of glory the naked spur but the dapper dressed muscular meeker given the part of his life comes through brilliantly as the arrogant self absorbed snoop who pimps out his secretary to obtain information it makes one wonder why he had so few leading roles i believe other than that secretary he doesn t meet a woman with anything on other than a trench coat until the movie s end the only extra on the dvd is an alternative ending in which our hero is blown to bits by some sort of nuclear device contained in a suitcase the true ending the one aldrich chose for the complete film has meeker escaping the exploding house but for how long other than references by his police detective friend to the manhattan project and los alamos nothing is ever explained about the device in the suitcase when its top is lifted a bright burning glow is emitted and when completely removed hell is unleashed but how much is los angeles ultimately incinerated by a nuclear holocaust we never know from the film 
life changing experience the series of dark shadows that aired on nbc was a saving grace for me ! as a year old girl i stayed up late every friday night and got lost in the world of barnabas and angelique and josette my mother grew up on the original show and i ve seen many episodes of that as well but in my opinion it doesn t hold a candle to the revival series the actors in the series show such passion and soul in everything they do ! definitely see this series ! believe me it s worth it ! i own every episode on video 
tmnt ii secret of the ooze dvd i ve loved the ninja turtles since i was old enough to watch tv so i automatically love anything to do with them 
right on top of that rose this movie is awesome ! my sister and i used to watch this all the time back in the day so i ordered one for each of us the cinematography is a bit weird though it seems to have been recorded a little differently on the dvd it almost has a foreign look to it like australian or some english tv movies it doesn t change the viewing experience i was just a little surprised when i watched it 
a great film about van gogh lust for life based on irving stone s novel about vincent van gogh was filmed in and directed by vincente minnelli kirk douglas as vincent crackles with intensity he won a golden globe award for his portrayal depicting van gogh s artistic growth deep loneliness and inevitable descent into madness with sensitivity and pathos it is a moving performance that along with spartacus and paths of glory is one of his best anthony quinn as paul gauguin won a best supporting actor academy award james donald is especially touching as vincent s loving brother theo the film features a powerful and poignant musical score by the great film and classical music composer miklos rozsa composer of music for ben hur double indemnity ivanhoe and the lost weekend amongst many others this film is along with john huston s moulin rouge made in about the life of toulouse latrec one of my favorite hollywood films about an artist as soon as the titles appear on this recently released dvd you are aware of the superb transfer to disc written with van gogh s trademark thick impasto technique they leap off the screen with dimensional brilliance breathtakingly alive this is important because the film contains dozens of van gogh s most famous art works all filmed from the originals in the possession of private collectors and museums with their thick swirls of color and movement the images are stunningly beautiful making the dvd of the film a living art gallery this was worth the price of the dvd for me i wish there was some way each one of the paintings could have been bookmarked on the dvd to make them easier to find alas no however the other more disappointing aspect of this dvd release is that it does not contain the minute long making of documentary that often followed the showing of this film on turner classic movies this fine documentary showed how modern locations in holland belgium and france were painstakingly converted into the late th century locations actually painted by van gogh it also showed how kirk douglas developed his characterization it featured the process by which extras were chosen amongst local townspeople including one old french woman who had actually known van gogh had seen him paint and remarked upon douglas uncanny resemblance to the painter it is a wonderful little film and its absence from this dvd is inexplicable there is certainly room for it the only extras are a minute trailer and a fine commentary by dr drew casper a film historian who gives a deeper more academic analysis of the film than is usual for a commercial release not on criterion or kino this was a missed opportunity by turner entertainment that makes no sense and is deeply disappointing the film is in color shot in widescreen with an aspect ratio of enhanced for widescreen tvs it looks beautiful almost dimensionally vivid it is minutes in length sound is offered in dolby digital surround and sounds glorious miklos rozsa s music sounds especially alive languages for menus are english and french subtitles are in english french and spanish the region code is ntsc this is a film definitely worth getting for its beauty and its excellence its lack of appropriate extras is disappointing but that is tempered by gratitude for finally having this wonderful deeply moving film available on dvd i strongly recommend this dvd release for that fact alone mike birma 
sentimental favorite when my daughter was born a relative and i wound up reminiscing about this album and how much we both loved it growing up next thing i knew a copy of the dvd arrived as a gift for my daughter and me the first time i sat down and watched it brought back all my memories of being a little girl in the s i could even still sing along with the title song ! right now my daughter is too young to do much except listen as i sing or play music for her but i hope she grows up enjoying these songs as much as i did yes the visuals are dated but i believe the messages of these songs are as pertinent now as they were thirty years ago best of all the songs get their messages across without being preachy i think this is a fabulous alternative to much of what s out there for kids today and dated as some elements may be free to be you and me is still a long long way from going out of style 
the music man robert preston s version of the music man is the only version matthew broderick is not the music man ! 
anti fascist moral disguised as a movie hume croyin is the sadistic prison captain aiming for the warden s position while burt lancaster is the prisoner trying to break a bunch of the cons out the message is clear treat people like animals and they ll act like animals the flashbacks get in the way of the movie but otherwise this is an excellent men inprison flick with an exciting let strytobreakout ending 
well acted with a cool monster when the first man into space gets a cosmic dusting it does some strange things to his mind and body pretty good monster and a very good leading man marshall thompson make for a better than average s genre sci fi story close to a classic there was some light speckling in the transfer but all in all the dvd played well and the sound mono was acceptable 
wonderful the bicycle thief vittorio de sica one of the things i adore about italian filmmakers is that they know how to end their movies whether it s completely understated michele soavi s dellamorte dell amore or so over thetop that cheesy doesn t even begin to describe it argentos suspiria you know that you re going to get some sort of reward for the build up the bicycle thief is no exception to the rule you see the ending coming from a mile away but that doesn t make it any less of a payoff antonio ricci lamberto maggiorani is trying to get along in post world war ii italy where poverty is rampant he lands a job hanging posters for which he needs a bicycle the family has to sell the bedsheets to get his out of the repair shop but that s all right innit after all he s making money now until that is on the morning of his first day on the job his bicycle is stolen by one of the city s ubiquitous bicycle thieves for the rest of the movie antonio aided by his son bruno the barefoot contessa s enzo staiola and some friends goes looking for his bicycle and or the guy who stole it antonio consumed more and more by the random injustice of the thing and his frustration at the indifference of the rest of the world to his plight finally hits bottom with the expected results antonio is at no point in this movie the good guy even when he s on top of the world having just gotten his bicycle out of hock he berates his wife for stopping to visit a seer in a scene that s actually one of the film s most suspenseful since you know his bicycle s going to get stolen you just don t know when he berates the seer yes which later becomes an integral part of his character but his wife as well which is an integral part of his character right then he s never all that good to his kid he orders his friends around like mussolini when he gets frustrated he takes the kid out for grilled cheese sandwiches and the two of them proceed to get plastered allowing antonio and de sica a rumination on class structure as the daughter of a wealthy patron of the restaurant catches bruno s eye all of this is in a way morbidly funny and yet you know you re watching a tragedy antonio as low rent lear or titus andronicus and maggiorani who despite having turned in in his big screen debut one of the great performances in italian film to that point never landed anything more than a supporting role the rest of his life plays antonio as if he knows antonio is andronicus but not as if antonio knows antonio is andronicus that s great stuff right there ive been putting off watching this for years because honestly i had no idea why a movie about a bicycle thief would have captured the imagination of critics and the public alike well now i know and i have to tell you they re right this is a fascinating study of a man s slow descent into obsession and it s well worth your time 
the king s whore was she worth it i think not ultimately she cost him everything imaginable true he was obsessed with her and tried to manipulate her into this relationship but no matter how it is presented she was the one who made the decision to go to him on the first night with him she was obviously more than cooperative refusing the offer of a change of clothing and disrobing in front of him willingly she seemed intent on using him to the max you think their first encounter is blissful but you see the king s happiness begin to fade as she begins to outline her requests she wants him to dismiss her husband s family from court his minister she wants exiled the home she shared with her husband she wants destroyed so no one else can ever live in it you name it she asks him for it he gives in to every one of her demands we see her in his bed being coquetteish and manipulating him then when he makes overtures toward her she becomes livid he doesn t understand what is happening to him since he has never had nor wanted a mistress before now he finds himself consumed with his need for this woman to the point of striking her when she refuses his advances you just know this king has never struck a woman before in his life but she s all he can think about he needs to know where she is every minute it becomes obvious this king does love her when she contracts smallpox he takes total care of her applying balms bathing her staying with her night and day to keep her from scratching herself so she won t be scarred for life still this is definitely an unhealthy relationship women in those days married and had trysts with men who meant nothing to them all the time because they had no control over their lives the men in charge fathers etc made those decisions for them and they followed whatever path was laid out for them doesn t mean it was right but that is the way women were treated therefore it is difficult to relate to her rage increasing as the relationship becomes more intense she becomes as obsessed with getting free of hiim as he is with keeping her this even seems to have become a love hate kind of game between them by now we are sure she loves him even though she is unwilling or unable to show it meanwhile she is constantly given and accepts jewelry art clothing whatever she wants and then some but does not give him any real pleasure in return as far as can be determined this review is muddled i know but so are the emotions in this film in the meantime timothy dalton is absolutely gorgeous definitely at his peak in every way i am not impressed with the countess i think she was miscast and not nearly pretty enough to have this obsesssion be believable why do i love this film i don t know but it doesn t matter i do 
fun for everyone this movie is pure fun my whole family loved it it s corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it s amatuer hour but its fun to watch we made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing watch it and enjoy 
memories still a great movie the special features with paula prentis commentary was great 
doctor who and the first download doctor who materialised without his tardis on this my first timelord download in the amazon unbox which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside for a very reasonable sum my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration where he encounters the nestene conciousness the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental a great experience and will not be the last easy to navigate and fun for all the family someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type tardis 
the best psycho thriller since the usual suspects a supurb roster of actors headed by tim roth bring to life this horrifying glimpse into the human mind and the psychoses of two individuals as the story behind a murder is uncovered in the grand tradition of the usual suspects the characters in deceiver change dramatically from the intriguing beginning to the exciting end highly recommended for any lovers of mystery and psychological thrillers 
this has been a love story i finally made my first purchase from amazon s unbox video downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience for i purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of the twilight zone and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection i don t think it s the most ideal way to see full length motion pictures but for a minute classic tv program i think my lcd monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean aired on september as the show s third season opener the episode is a cold war fantasy appropriately called two about the last two survivors on earth a man and a woman after an apocalyptic world war in written and directed by tv veteran montgomery pittman the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an american infantryman and she is an invading russian soldier like two feral animals they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him the reality of their solitary existence however gradually dawns on them especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue prekrassnyi the russian word for lovelywhat really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting two years before she twitched her nose on bewitched a brunette elizabeth montgomery looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun plays the untrusting russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability the american is played by perennial tough guy charles bronson fresh from the magnificent seven even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism they make an odd couple but it works splendidly i also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the nd century narrated by rod serling in his inimitably halting manner the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript this has been a love story this is classic tv 
it was jessica all along hey guys ! we are not plugging this movie well enough if my wife didn t give me this for a birthday or something and i wasn t just in the mood to watch something different this evening i would have never picked up on this great little movie we need to get the word out ! my take agreed this is a great team to pull this off the non surprise ending could have been so hoaky but they actually did it in a way i was glad becky finally got left out of it let her find her own match if there is one but i see a whole lot of depth in the whole point of this comedy it is all true ! none of this was a con that is the beauty of it the beauty of it is the con this is so true in so many ways and we love it and know we do so the movie is not just cute not just funny it has a very serious point about life to make if we just see it didn t someone say something like heaven is all around you you just don t see it you need the right story and things will be well 
enjoyable i like to watch cary grant movies and the talk of the town may not be his best movie but it is good and enjoyable ! cary grant is very good and so are ronald colman and jean arthur 
jane as she should be portrayed this is in my opinion the best jane eyre of them all the characters look the part and the film is beautifully shot and convincingly acted a great romantic movie 
i love this movie this is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time it s funny and beautiful with a perfect cast the music and the scenery is breathtaking i agree with a previous reviewer i can t think of anything that isn t perfect with this film

awfully funny after accusing each other of infidelity jerry and lucy impulsively decide to divorce they have to wait until the divorce is final but in the meantime each begins to date other people lucy dates an oilman from oklahoma and jerry has great fun doing everything he can to ruin the romance including telling her how much she ll like oklahoma s night life compared to new york s lucy gets her revenge by pretending to be his sister when jerry dates a rich socialite when they re not trying to sabotage each other s relationships jerry and lucy are fighting over the custody of their dog mr smith the awful truth is one of the funniest screwball comedies that i ve ever seen cary grant and irene dunne are a delight as the feuding couple who truly deserve each other there are many laugh out loud scenes in this movie including when jerry thinks lucy is having an affair with her voice teacher and bursts in on what he thinks is the two of them an off screen fight between jerry and said voice teacher jerry s date with a nightclub singer and many many more there are plenty of double entendres and sight gags to keep you laughing from the very beginning you know how the movie is going to end but it s a lot of fun getting to that ending the awful truth is awfully funny 
a beautiful film stealing beauty is a beautiful film with beautiful people and beautiful lush settings the film is directed by bernardo bertolucci the italian director behind films like last tango in paris and the dreamers this film is probably one of his most overlooked i wanted to get it because i think liv tyler is gorgeous and she looks even more beautiful than usual in this film the movie judging by reviews i ve seen on netflix doesn t have a lot of people who like it one person even remarked that you d be better off getting a travel video but this is actually a pretty good film tyler plays a virginal yearold girl named lucy harmon whose mother a poet has recently passed away and whose father has sent her back to the tuscan villa inhabited by artists that her mother used to be friends with the people that own the place are diane sinead cusack and ian donal mccann a sculptor whose sculptures line the yard other people are there as well including miranda rachel weisz and her boyfriend richard dw moffett also there is alex jeremy irons a writer who takes a liking to lucy lucy spends her day writing poetry that she quickly burns and looking for insight into her past she believes that her father is not really her father and is trying to figure out who is a lot of people who see this movie will only be seeing it to watch tyler disrobe which she does but it s not in enough to abundance to be the only reason you see this movie even though i liked it i found myself wondering what was the point the point of a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre is to horrify the point of pulp fiction is to entertain and electrify but what is the point of stealing beauty the plot can be summed up in a few words and the movie plays like quiet jazz music maybe the beauty in the title sums up this film it focuses on beauty but not just exterior beauty the movie has a lot of beautiful people likeliv tyler and rachel weisz but then there s the jeremy irons character he s sick almost bald and is always pale but likes to admire the beauty around him a lot of the characters are into art lucy does poetry ian sculpts richard acts and alex writes stealing beauty is not so much about plot as it is about atmosphere and feeling the way you might like a gray rainy day because of how you feel not what the day looks like another film that plays like this could become dull but stealing beauty for me was never dull that could be attributed to the spectacular performances which are all low key tyler is perfectly cast she looks so innocent and vulnerable in the film irons gives one of his best performances the man can do more with a whisper than most actors can with a flamboyant speech it s not perfect but it is a good film that s easy to enjoy just kick back enjoy the scenery and bask in the beauty of it grade b 
if you like humor you ought to purchase this tape chris elliott s comedy tends to polarize viewers you either think it s the funniest thing you ve ever seen or you become violently angry that someone like that has been allowed on teevee if there were more people like the former get a life would still be on the air and chris elliott would be rich and famous unfortunately here on earth the show got cancelled early and until recently has been unavailable on tape or on reruns if you re the kind of person who finds watching incredibly stupid people portrayed by smart comedians doing incredibly stupid things unbearable maybe you ought to look and see if you can get friends or seinfeld on cassette if you enjoy smart comedy about stupid people written for smart people do yourself a favor buy this tape and give rhino a few bucks and convince em to release a few more volumes 
a real tear jerker this movie was so very well done and so very sad it will reach around from behind you and pleasure you in a way you didn t expect but will leave you feeling very sad at the end sad but inspired and that is what this movie is about inspiration morrie was a great stand up character who was always pitching a tent so to speak i highly recommend this movie 
the film is great too bad they don t send new ones when you ask this is a classic comedy and a must for those who are intersted in the old school of comedic actors watch for the cameo appearances by jon pertwee 
absolutely riveting no this isn t courtney of friends but once you get past that this is must watch tv ! while the show has content that can be shocking it is so well written and edited it all fits it is definitely a sequential drama and makes much more sense watching the episodes back to back that fleshes out the characters so you start to care about and understand them courtney shows her acting chops best at those moments when she is silent and lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog is a bit stilted the best character is the functional schizophrenic photographer don konkey he is exhibits an endearing combination of weirdness loyalty insight and sweetness to become the break out star of this series if you only watched one episode and wrote this one off go back and watch a few back to back and you may just find yourself addicted 
bellum omni vorat war devours everything is the general theme of this more recent adaptation of erich maria remarque s famous novel directed by delbert mann the film satisfies on many levels with a very good script good cinematography and direction and the good acting talents of richard thomas ernest borgnine donald pleasance and ian holm the story is a first person narrative detailing the life of its author paul baumer richard thomas during the period of the great war from baumer just graduated from high school and like every other good german he signs up for the war along with his classmates to serve his fatherland it is the ideal that has been pounded into them by their school teacher donald pleasance at first all gleaming with overconfidence the narrator and his friends soon realize that there s no glory in war even if one has dutifuly served the fatherland and received an iron cross pinned to their chest by the kaiser himself as with the book the narrative uses the characters to show how the reality of war in one way or another destroys or changes the ideals of life it is rich in showing the futility and beastiality of war the film really looks at the two main schools of thought that were a product of wwi positivists such as bertrand russel who thought that modern progress was a positive factor to humanity if guided by moral values and the school of nihilism that thought morality was relative and human existence purposeless that modern industrialization was not a sign of progress but the beginning of the end baumer and his friends are at first the voices of the positivists despite the war they re all still obsessed with their dreams of becoming artists writers theologists farmers and foresters their sergeant ernest borgnine is the sobering pragmatist who teaches the youths to dispense with idealism and to bear only the brutal reality of war in their thoughts he teaches them the practical skills of finding good food and to survive by using their shovels to kill the enemy instead of the bayonet slowly but surely each of the narrator s friends become victims of the war despite their idealism some of them are killed precisely because of their idealism in short the narrative subtly explores every possible facet of war in how it permanently destroys disfigures or otherwise changes life and the human spirit it explores the utter futility and dehumanization of war although one follows baumer s optimism throughout the story one realizes that optimism ultimately changes nothing in terms of the reality of war only one s perception of it the story actually leaves the question open as to whether an optimistic outlook serves any purpose at all in either war or peace the film also shows the growing gap between the young soldiers and the elder generations who still saw war in the context of the th century as a glorious and heroic duty sacrifice to the state in contrast the youths are ages apart as they ve experienced first hand the horror and desolation of modern warfare which their elders cannot possibly understand eg machine guns planes mustard gas etc this is an excellent film that has great direction cinematography and acting that is far above the standards of a made fortv film the filming in the czech republic is always a good place for german austrian related films ie amadeus the script was well done to bring out the poignant themes in the book there are some inaccuracies and limitations in its depiction of the military and equipment during that time but a lot of it is budget related as opposed to being signs of incompetence ie no artillery is shown few aircraft no tanks etc with the way the soldiers are constantly placing their rifles muzzle first into the mud in every scene it makes you wonder whether it was the script s soldiers or the actors who received such incompetent training in handling a firearm in battle there s also a scene where a corporal badmouths a sergeant and everyone seems to think it s normal anyway these are simply minor defects that have no major impact on the film i strongly recommend it as the only other version although a classic film is black and white and over years old good companions to this film would be the lost batallion gallipoli and the blue max which all deal with wwi in terms of theme a good counterpoint to this film is cross of iron which is also a great film in exploring the futility absurdity of war except that it is set in wwii from the german perspective unlike this film cross of iron is grounded in a nihilistic theme that rejects the notion of idealism having any use either in warfare or life in general making the theme perhaps even bleaker than this one 
outstanding in every aspect this first disc on all editions of this movie on dvd includes a making of featurette that should more than please the casual fan of the film the second disc exclusive to the special edition goes deeper into just about every aspect of the production i just wish they d lower the amount of mutual pats in the back and tom does all his stunts a bit i guess my favorite mission would be the first but all of them have great things going on for them as action films go they really belong at the top of the crop the best thing going on for mi is ethan hunt s supporting team which for once work together the way they used to in the old series i have a hard time understanding the cold shoulder audiences have given tom cruise over his couch jumping thing sure it s hard getting excited about a hollywood star wanting to marry for the third time but as celebrities go nowadays it s not even worth mentioning it this reminds me the time when james cameron joked about being king of the world after winning an oscar and people becoming bitter towards him i guess some people don t like to see others being too happy with their lives if cruise follows some religion which to some of us sounds more than a bit loony at least he hasn t done anything to attack mine like all those involved in the da vinci code at any rate don t let the mediocre box office results of mi discourage you from watching it you can see a real effort to make an outstanding film in every scene 
outstanding movie this movie has everything you need in a great who done it i will watch this over and over 
happy to watch this movie is a classic a young er nicholas cage is fun to watch as is the entire cast ! one of my favorites to watch over and over ! 
fan of old horror movies if you can t appreciate a classic horror movie with simple effects then this is not the movie for you otherwise enjoy ! 
engrossing from the first seconds clooney is a marvel this story was so captivating that i sat on the edge of my seat straining to hear all the dialogue althought the scene shifts make it difficult to track at first i was drawn in and held spellbound

five stars for no thanks to here s my favorite peckinpah i m throwing my two bits to the version which is slower more elegaic quietly building power dylan s words over slim pickens death scene make that moment too literal in the edition the words repeating what we know its a great song on its own separated from the scene the version re edits the scene of garrett and the prostitutes in a heavy handed pc way and snips out a great image of one of the women staring hard into the face of the uptight marshal where we re trusted to draw our own conclusions the film gains enormously from the drained color of the version presenting a gray world of desolate choices between one kind of death and another with the color re saturated in the edition the film tends toward a naturalistic western which is not in keeping with the ennervated intangible feeling of the violence plus the cut deletes the line pat garrett says to the marshal at the end what you want and what you get are two different things the way that line is said makes it just as compelling as the more famous one from ride the high country i just want to enter my house justified on its own i did like the added scene of garrett at home with his wife in a minute or two you could get a whole picture of their marriage but even so i didn t feel it was necessary to the film you can surmise without it that garrett has sought respectability by settling down the kind of woman he would marry and the degree of honor albeit his womanizing he would bring to that pact it is still a very good scene it makes all those qualities particular but in my view it does not justify re editing the film or really belong with the mood and structure of the whole it could have made an extra instead 
wonderful this is a great movie i loved the music dancing and the intense chemistry between the actors i especially enjoyed the handsome sexy chayanne he s an excellent singer dancer and actor he and vanessa looked amazing together i prefer this movie to dirty dancing if anyone wants to see and hear more of chayanne he s in a new commercial and has realeased a new video from his latest album cautivo which has gone multi platinum 
the honor of god and the king what a treat for moviegoers to see this magnificent film on the big screen again after years originally released in directed by peter glenville and starring richard burton as thomas becket and peter o toole as henry ll becket holds up well with time based on the play by the same name by jean anouilh the movie is based with cinematic license here and there for example he is a dirty saxon here on the life and martyrdom of thomas becket archbishop of canterbury both tennyson and eliot produced major works on the same subject matter although many period pieces like this one are visually stunning to watch as this one is they often leave the viewer cold as this one does but in this instance because of superb acting henry complains often that he is always cold and that becket is not warm in his affection to him this coldness is so real as to be palpable in the theatre it is a pleasure to watch burton and o toole in their verbal fencing as both actors give as good as they get neither actor ever looked or acted better the scene where becket and henry meet on horseback at the sea and becket tells henry that he will never see him again is worth whatever you paid to see the movie other actors besides o toole and burton give outstanding performances as well particularly john gielgud as king louis vii and david weston as the young brother john becket s disciple and attendant becket is about big themes honor becket i am waiting for the honor of the god and the king to be one my lord friendship and love and a film for all seasons 
great fun and kind of scarey i really enjoyed this movie great music good effects for the time the movie was made and unexpectedly funny enjoy 
gripping and highly benedictive of my chain saw man series of books the texas chainsaw massacre leatherface is a fabulous film which i have owned on vhs for well over years i personally know reedy a mihailoff who played the gruesome leathrface in this said film a brillaint but exciting rendition that is comprised with the customary horror that is texas chainsaw massacre but the thrill of the hunt was still intact but carried out in a slightly varied genre that it s original predecessor i did not care much for the house that nestled this murderous family but again like the room upstairs in thisd original i own peices of that house i e the pink spindles wallpaper up there etc however the setting claimed much warrant behind the overall theme courtesy of the author of the chain saw man series of bookslama milkweed l augustinea truely memorable beginning and ending that creates a lasting impact that makes the onlooker beg for more 
still much to learn from this film it s been some time since this film first appeared at sundance at the end of the s but it does not lose it s power many will shy away from it s difficult subject matter it is not a family film neither is twin peaks and that is an indisputable masterpiece watch the acting these actors have much to offer it s apparent that like most indie films they need some script tweaking but that not withstanding it is worth your time 
dolores claiborne my dvd came brand new and wrapped in plastic it takes alittle longer but was worth the wai 
we were soldiers this is an excellent movie if you like war flicks it made me angry being from the vietnam generation also it shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men the acting from all the cast was top class i highly recommend this movie it may be slow at first but the action later is amazing 
the land girls being english i can relate to the trauma s of this wonderful movie it is real life of war torn england in the face of defeat they could not have picked better actors for this movie and the scenery of land and the farm are excellant one could really quotquotsmellquotquot the farm house and it s surrounds wonderful 
shattering this film is slick and shattering with an underbelly of sobbering disatisfaction christie is pognient harvey is cool with cracks of vulnerability that informs the emptiness of his life bogarde is sympathetic and callow a basically good man who is seduced by an elusive beauty that could never be the direction is crisp the music and sound very good 
helpful for me but not as much as young fabulous i recently read suze orman s young fabulous and broke yfb and found that a very helpful guide on how to begin building a solid financial foundation for a young man given the quality of her advice in that book i chose this as a follow up and i was interested to hear about her philosophy of money as indicated by the spiritual steps in the title some reviewers say that she repeats herself in her books certainly some of the advice here is included in yfb but some of her retirement advice was new for me also she includes more stories about her own life and about her clients lives the advice on wills vs trusts was especially helpful the emphasis on exercises was not that helpful for me when she tells me to write down my history and experiences i don t feel i m getting more than a slap on the back for journalling which i already do consistently i d prefer that suze stick to financial advice and leave more of the counseling to the psychologists however i am glad to hear her testify about some of her own attitudes about money and her family s experience more so than the exercises early on i found that her philosophy towards the end of the book was very revealing again i m not sure she needs to explicitly use terms like dharma to get her points across but she does make a strong case that those who treat money well will see it nurture them regardless of the amount of money that they have in their bank account for a nation that is struggling to recover from terrorism and hurricane tragedies this is simple but sage advice while i d recommend that those who are and under read young fabulous and broke first i found this book helpful as well and i do plan to use some of these ideas with my parents and to plan my own retirement in the future stars s

informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
choked up most reviews miss what was for me as a child the most inspiring portion of the film i would choke up at the final scene when the crew having decided to not tell the details of the raid leave the courtroom to face death marching down the hallway with smiles on their faces to stirring music it still grabs me today 
talk about christmas spirit i really love bones it has everything suspense drama humor pretty people fun storylines i have yet to miss an episode and even into season this is probably my favorite it adds depth to all of the characters also the winter holidays are my favorite time of year i like holidays that are about what is good in the world bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day i cry through half this episode but in a completely good way buy watch it love it but watch it with a friend if you don t want to cry alone so moving great performances by the whole cast emily deschanel was powerful in this one she brings real vulnerability to brennan here david boreanaz as always the perfect sympathetic hero loveably old fashioned cute funny moments touching poignant moments this really is the best of what is great about bones 
survivors unite against freddy krueger new director for this third episode the modern world is growing and we are starting to have the information highway coming into the picture the new architecture is very striking and powerful we come back to a girl as the center of the film but at once that girl is living with her mother and her male guests but also at once she is moved to a hospital where she meets a whole gang of young people who are freddy s victims freddy does not try to make anyone kill the others at first he tries to terrorize them into committing suicide society reacts as can be expected the kids are calling for some attention and their dreams and suicides are nothing but the symptoms of their guilt a junior doctor reacts positively when a psychiatrist comes into the picture and this psychiatrist is the surviving girl of a preceding episode this leads to a psychiatric ward in a hospital with all these kids and group therapy this time freddy has a group against him a group that can remain united or at least the survivors can and they can start a war against this freddy the film also densifies freddy krueger with a mother who was a medical personnel in the old psychiatric ward of the very hospital in which we are this wing of the building was closed when this young woman was by accident left behind in the ward surrounded by all kinds of crazy criminals she was raped and many other things and freddy is her son even worse she lost her head though not completely and could then dedicate the end of her life to religion she became a nun the father of the young psychiatrist who has survived freddy was one of those who burnt freddy to death when he was caught after kudnapping and killing twenty children his remains had never been buried the father will finally accept to tell where the bones are during that time the kids and the young psychiatrist are getting into the dream to save the others who have been taken and to get rid of freddy they will not all come back but they will come back after freddy s destruction by the junior doctor burying the bones and sprinkling them with holy water before covering them with earth it is the first time the christian theme is brought in with holy water and a crucifix hence with a parallel to vampires the film then is a new twist in the general fabric invented by wes craven and it is quite effective we must go on in this saga to see where we are going where we are taken to be sure freddy will live forever and ever ever after the end of each film dr jacques coulardeau university of paris dauphine university of paris pantheon sorbonne 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
the search for shangri la this is an excellent documentary of shangri la and its elusive transcendental nature 
harry block lives in a fellini movie an homage to fellini with dream sequences in which harry block s fictional characters from his short stories interwine with his real life characters deconstructing harry is about a writer who cannibalizes his life experience using his loved ones and family as fodder for his fiction and who in the process alienates humiliates and enrages those people who prefer their secrets not be featured in published fiction amongst this turmoil the writer harry is obsessed with freeing himself from himself a sixty yearold man who never grows up but who remains fixated on his childish ego his raging lusts and his incurable narcissism divorced several times barely able to see his young son and resenting that a lover whom he scorned is now marrying he must negotiate between the people he has alienated and the fictional characters who merge with reality as he goes on a soul quest to answer the question can i ever grow up i can t reveal the ending but will say that the film maintains a fellinisque comic tone that has a hint of magic the film does an excellent job of showing harry s real life adventures and weaving them with dramatizations of his stories that parallel his condition 
cinderella dvd i ve been looking for this video in stores for a long time and never found it i watched this every year on tv as a child so when i found amazon had it i bought it for myself for my st birthday i guess you re never too old for a good fairy tale 
very hilarious truely speaking this is a very hilarious episode must see for every one 
bigger and better than ever before ! go ninja go ninja go yes it s corny but this is early s everything back then was cool at the time but corny today this movie took everything the first movie did but made it huge more mutants ooze a friggen s style hip hop dance even this was popular at the time remember the urkel dance all the actors did a good job the new asian kid had some slick martial arts abilities and his fresh headstrong attitude added much to this movie even the british dude from titanic was good the ninja rap at the end of the movie is hilarious to watch today but at the time was the coolest thing on the planet i remember seeing people in the theater cheering getting out of their chairs and singing along to it it was nuts gotta love it 
enjoyable i bought two sci fi movies at the same time this one and velocity trap i have to say i enjoyed crossworlds far more than the other 
excellent romantic comedy this laid back romantic comedy from is a real treat particularly because of the performances walter matthau and glenda jackson were so wonderfully combustible in the movie they were again paired in hopscotch though oddly in the second film they spent little time on screen together art carney is a riot as a bumbling chief of staff and all the supporting performances from richard benjamin to the always delightful candace azzara are equally enjoyable howard zieff has a lackadaisical directing style that perfectly suits the material and actors he basically gets out of the way and lets everyone shine if you have not seen this movie give it a try it was so successful it was made into a sitcom the following year but without matthau and jackson it didn t really go anywhere one odd and rather irritating thing though the movie has the obligatory s love montage in the middle in the original film and in the tv versions and vhs versions the beatles something in the way she moves was the background music and it was just wonderful the film was cut to the music and it really had an impact on the two leads relationship michael jackson and co unless he has since sold the rights must not have allowed the music to be used on the dvd or made a ridiculous demand for the song is missing there is just some mediocre filler music behind the montage and it really hurts that section of the film it s annoying they were not able to put the movie on dvd in its original form 
excellent film this movie is a romantic tale of a young man who wants to be the best salsa dancer in the world pretty much it s kind of cheesy and corny but the dancing in the film is superb the main character is a buff good looking guy with a jerry curl hehe i guess that was cool during the time the movie was made ! he is overprotective of his sister blah blah she goes out with his friend and he is against it but realizes that he is being stupid and goes on to become a great dancer good watch for those of you into movies such as dirty dancing and llambada 
not one false note in any of these films the decalogue is indeed as collosal and as moving as people have said each film is inspired by one of the commandments although the commandments are never mentioned directly kieslowski made these films all in one year which to me is amazing this was made for polish tv showing that television doesn t have to be completely stupid all the time all of these segments are full of moral ambiguity and clear answers are never given just like in real life i love the fact that kieslowski never answers things directly if this was an american production it would have gone ways first it could have been a right wing simplistic heavy handed message film that would have been dumbed down to the level of a year old like an afterschool special or it could have been a whiny left wing politically correct tolerance episode where everything would have worked out because people are basically good and everyone needs self esteem either way is both insulting and disingenuous i especially like the nd film where a woman who is having an affair and is pregnant by her lover has a husband who is the hospital her husband could possibly die she pesters the doctor to find out about her husband s condition partly out of concern but because of her fetus as well she tells the doctor that if her husband lives she ll abort the fetus if he dies she ll have the baby that s a very murky morally ambiguous situation when sitting through this part i wondered what i would do in that situation i haven t a clue really when i saw clint eastwood s masterpiece million dollar baby i thought of these films because eastwood s film and kieslowski s films dealt with morally complex issues in an adult and artistic way these films are about life and art there is no time in this film or the other segments where you feel that you re being lectured to and i love that about it it s about religious things but religion isn t mentioned it s about morals yet you don t feel that it is it s great art that s all and that is enough 
space adventure great movie good actor s within a real fun one for us who like the space type movies worth to be added to your collection 
it just sparkles the architecture fashion interior design of post war america is all right here in s nyc you just can t beat it yeah it s corny in more places in one but the overall effect is one you don t want to miss 
a winning election rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence teenage angst sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from alexander payne reese witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range matthew broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for witherspoon s often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality in his screen debut chris klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against witherspoon and jessica campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty one of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election reese prays to an unfamiliar god and beseeches him to let her win so she can carry out his divine plan campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to while goofy klein shows the most depth by thanking god for all of his blessings especially his large penis and telling god he knows the best candidate will win election is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind enjoy 
what s so racist about this movie i don t see anything racist about this movie the two main characters are nowhere near stereotypical asians sure harold and kumar are intelligent individuals but they also like to get stoned however everyone should agree that this film makes fun of everyone from white trash to over achieving asians to brutal cops to skinheads to whatever so calling this racist because of the minor stereotypical asian characters that are present for only a few minutes is idiotic anyway this film s flat out hilarious hurry up and buy rent it 
hg wells this is an amazing service ! for only bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography 
real future for humans even though this movie is classified as a fictional comedy and is quite outrageous i can visulize that current events taking place in our time could realistically lead to this new type of incredibly low iq human it is somewhat entertaining from an entertainment standpoint but the true brillance is in the concept hidden in the dumb humor this movie is good for simple entertainment and excellent for anyone contemplating the future of the human species 
jet li in action this is a showcase of jet li s brand of martial arts fast and furious while this is no fist of legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going what i did nt anticipate was the humor absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it s own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying 
it knocked me out of my chair being that this film was a parody of the most dangerous game says tla video and john woo s yes him hard target the pest most closely resembles hard target which did win awards from academy of science fiction fantasy horror films usa it most likely is inspired and adapts from both films both serious films while this was a farce and satire perhaps not politically correct if analyzing those quacky and karaoke scenes some would say too much emphasis on bodily humor but this is a film about hunting the outdoors where men women squat and use pheremones father i feel funny to attract prey john leguizamo vs jean claude van damme does it get any funnier it goes on the shelf next to beyond therpay and sibling rivalry 
one of ben stiller s funniest films year old gerry garner joins a group of heavy kids that are sent to their favorite fat camp for the summer camp hope a place where they re supposed to lose weight but instead have a fun time the kids find out that the camp has been sold to a crazy fitness instructor named tony perkins ben stiller so now the camp has turned into a living hell for the kids no more candy or fun things like go karts and the blob tony wants the kids to lose weight so he ll be able to make a profit from his fitness tv commercials he has a camera man follow him around the camp however the kids rebel against tony because they want to have fun not exercise therefore tony starts to go crazy in a hilarious way so he decides to counter their actions for example one day he takes their lunch away and on another day takes them on a mile hike among other things gerry and his new friends along with the original camp staff members pat who has visited the camp every summer for the past years and a goofy counselor named tim who became fit before the summer as well as a new nurse named julie decide to take the camp back ben stiller is hilarious in this movie seeing him as an insane health nut patting kids down searching for a pez dispenser or watching his character getting mad at the kids is great while the film is not a cinema masterpiece stiller s performance in this film is great and he delivers some of the funniest lines i ve heard in a movie his character in this film is like a younger version of white goodman in dodgeball is this a guilty pleasure definitely as for the dvd in disney established a new policy whereby any movies that they feel have limited adult appeal will be released on dvd in pan scan only no widescreen dvd they ve reneged a bit since then but many titles from their live action catalogue have made their dvd debuts exclusively in reformatted fullscreen this affects every unreleased live action disney film particularly those that the studio suspects have limited appeal outside of children therefore this film like many disney classics is only available on dvd in fullscreen pan and scan bleh 
great money woops i mean it s very funny there are so many movies like hot shots but this dvd is well worth the price i would suggest everyone getting it it s just a funny spoof of a whole bunch of movies this hot shots movie is better then hot shots ! part deux by the way

mansfield park what can i say this is another great jane austin story and if you love jane austin you tend to love all of her stories and i do 
holy nostalgia i had the pleasure of watching this movie and the accompanying tv series in two different but equally enjoyable phases first as a th grader when they were first released in the s when i took them at face value as super hero adventure stories and later as an adult reveling in the campy humor and the droll dead pan delivery of adam west this is a very corny movie but in a good way ! lots of fun i especially enjoyed watching it while listening to the commentary by west and burt ward and by the way i m not a kid any more but i still want that batmobile in my garage and want to take the bat boat out for a high speed run on lake grapevine 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
good but not better than the original this was a good sequel but not better than the first one he plays kurts brother and fights tong po van damne is way better though 
still good entertainment i thoroughly enjoyed the animals and would have liked more info given about them the movie is pure entertainment with wonderful color except coloring the tiger black weird they can leave off the technical jargon i want to hear about the animals and how some of the scenes were shot how the actors played their parts etc what rigors did the actors have to go through the set making was interesting and oh yeah didn t they know anything about horses definitely a fun movie 
groundbreaking i believe this is known as the first official known documentary film like all good documentaries it was able to make me the viewer relate to the subject i was able to empathize and feel for the plight of nanook and his family such a classic 
this has been a love story i finally made my first purchase from amazon s unbox video downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience for i purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of the twilight zone and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection i don t think it s the most ideal way to see full length motion pictures but for a minute classic tv program i think my lcd monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean aired on september as the show s third season opener the episode is a cold war fantasy appropriately called two about the last two survivors on earth a man and a woman after an apocalyptic world war in written and directed by tv veteran montgomery pittman the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an american infantryman and she is an invading russian soldier like two feral animals they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him the reality of their solitary existence however gradually dawns on them especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue prekrassnyi the russian word for lovelywhat really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting two years before she twitched her nose on bewitched a brunette elizabeth montgomery looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun plays the untrusting russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability the american is played by perennial tough guy charles bronson fresh from the magnificent seven even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism they make an odd couple but it works splendidly i also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the nd century narrated by rod serling in his inimitably halting manner the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript this has been a love story this is classic tv 
amazing movie we watched this movie in my modern latin america class it moved me to tears what happened in argentina in that period la guerra sucia and los desaparecidos is something which must be exposed so that it never happens again this movie is subtile it never shows torture or killing although perhaps up to argentines dissapeared but it shows the culture of fear that they were living in and how it even created rifts within the same family i highly recomend this film 
ghost busters with a kick if you love any kind of ghost movies this should be a definite buy ! this movie is funny and creepy at all the right moments and michael fox gives an outstanding performance throughout and not to mention the acting done by jake busey was also incredible this is an all out fun film that should definitely get picked up especially if you like any of peter jacksons works 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods 
season stargate atlantis is great i like the idea of downloading the episodes but put in all the seasons why leave out season 
madchester madness one of the best casts in a long long time great british comedians such as steve coogan peter kay rob brydon simon pegg a very funny movies based on a true story about tony wilson the founder of the hacienda a famous nightclub in the s in manchester uk this movie is a must see for people into punk and dance 
hows jesus look to you now bob this is a classic western and one of sam peckinpah s greatest i found the dialouge and the chemistry between james coburns pat garrett and kris kristoffersons billy the kid to be mesmerizing kristofferson was very young in this part and fairly inexperienced as an actor but it doesn t show one bit the costumes and the period are portrayed perfectly the characters are dirty crash and wild there are many colorful characters portrayed by a lot of famous character actors that you have probably seen in a ton of movies slim pickens is also here in a brief but memorable role the kid and garretts friendship is what holds the movie together and even though they don t show their early outlaw years together they don t have to you can feel that the two have a long relationship and that their friendship runs very deep check this movie out if you want to see a great western and just a plain great piece of movie making 
i adore this movie i watch this about once a year and never get tired of it hepburn and tracy are great together as usual the company setting is appealing and makes me yearn for the pre pc days when big companies had bars christmas parties with drinking and revelry etc it s a christmas movie out of the ordinary my favorite scene is when it s raining and tracy goes home with hepburn they are all cozy with a fire and fried chicken and floating island only to be walked in upon by the wonderfully arrogant gig young sometimes i just watch this scene alone i also love the line near the end of the movie where young says he s been thinking and hepburn asks him what that was like a delight 
the lost world the best since the original this is the best movie based on sir arthur conan doyle s book the lost world i ve seen all the other ones and this is got to be the best one right up there with the original version the sfx are the best just like the ones in jurassic park and the acting is good too if your a movie buff and want to spend money then this is the movie for you 
an emotional journey i have no words to describe how this movie touched me one girl s faith passion for truth and justice determination to follow a calling and great love for her people changed everything how pleased we should be that such a story was given the portrayel it deserves on this magnifiscent film i highly reccomend 
great movie i have read well s book and seen the older movie that said i love this movie guy pearce is very convincing in his role we see a man in love when he looses that love he uses his genius to try and save her failing to do that he embarks on a quest to find out why when he gets his answer he realizes he has found a new life and to leave the past in the past i thought the ending with the past next to the future was well done and orlando jones role is entertaining 
the nun s story audrey hepburn is one of my favourite movie stars her portrayal of a nun is wonderful we are taken into the world behind the convent walls to follow her journey to becoming a nun with all it s challenges to the decision to remain a nun or join the resistance 
a powerful and moving story i initially wanted to see this movie because i am a huge oliver martinez fan and i wanted to see more of his work the fact that oliver does not appear until the end of this movie did not really cause a problem for me i was so engrossed from beginning to end with this movie that i hardly noticed oliver was missing javier bardem has to be one of the most passionate actors i have ever seen i was mesmerized by his protrayal of reinaldo arenas and while this movie may not be for everyone i would say it is the best biographical movie i have seen in my lifetime as added bonuses there was oliver martinez for me of course also sean penn was very good in his few minutes on the screen johnny depp had me lauging out loud at his potrayal of the transvite and the officer his facial expressions alone are pure comical genius and while i am a huge johnny depp fan as well i am glad his parts were minimal as javier bardem is the true acting genius in this film i am now going to further investigate reinaldo arenas and javier bardem and see what else they have done that may interest me isn t that the true motivation of a movie or writer making you want more from them

the best of the mann stewart westerns james stewart was a different man after he returned from world war ii although still capable of playing the lovable folksy character he played in comedies his films upon his return from the war sometimes took a hard even bitter edge and the majority of these films were the westerns he made in the s with great director anthony mann making eight films in all including non westerns such as the glenn miller story and strategic air command they formed one of the strongest bodies of work between a director and actor in hollywood history beginning in with winchester stewart and mann made westerns that belied many of the typical genre films of that era stewart s heroes instead of being stalwart upright and likable were often times somewhat shady sinister and not always likable of all of their great westerns including winchester the man from laramie bend of the river and others probably the best film of their collaboration was the naked spur a story about a vicious psychopathic outlaw captured by a group competing with each other to collect the bounty on the outlaw s head the outlaw played by relish and glee by robert ryan uses the group s collective and individual greed against them in a bid to escape stewarts performance is spectacular ranging wildly from bitter to sympathetic nervous to resolute and the rest of the cast is also dynamic and evenly matched this film was was well worth the wait for dvd and should be purchased by all stewart lovers western lovers and ryan lovers and perhaps one day there will be many more mann lovers because he was one of hollywood s best directors and he is largely forgotten today 
compelling sci fi thriller this film s tagline heralds julie christie carries the demon seed fear for her this kind of marketing does the film a disservice because it makes it seem like it s exploitation and demon seed is not that yes christie s character is violated by a machine and it is tantamount to rape but it is done in a way that is terrifying and not prurient the assailant in question is an artificial intelligence named proteus who has the means to reproduce brain cells much like humans proteus also has a desire to advance his kind in a way which he is not trapped in a computer terminal and can not only think like humans but feel like them as well proteus has a strange kind of logic and humanlike arrogance in advancing his said goal alas that arrogance also makes proteus a sympathetic and ultimately tragic figure credit actor robert vaughn as proteus for providing the best computer voice over work since douglas rain voiced hal in julie christie is also superb as dr susan harris a woman who is terrified but does not easily give up her inner strength or resolve good work is also delivered by fritz weaver as dr alex harris a man who in the wake of personal tragedy distances himself emotionally from his wife and devotes his energies to perfecting proteus 
scantily clad and behind bars a classic pam grier is sublime 
still lovely i love this little story of the relationship between two sisters the performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting it still gets me 
nice and awesome i absolutely love atlantis from ronon dex to sheppard and to all the faces i d cry if atlantis was cancelled seriously though steve should have never have died he should also have been put in command of sg can you imagine that why steve welcome to earth youre welcome to live out your life if you only feed in self defense on enemies kay oh you re also in charge of sg p but seriously the wraith make this show so awesome from steve to bob to edward to gordon and alexander to michael and eric by far james s best performance yet the wraith make this show what it is but one thing why don t we have before i sleep seriously you have no idea how irked i am at that since i began watching in s anyways i think atlantis totally pwns sg 
always a classic as a teacher of romeo and juliet this version stays pretty close to the original there are some parts that are left out but most students do not notice those they are more likely to notice the skin scenes of romeo and juliet s wedding night than the comic relief that has been excluded while the luhrmann version always hits closer to home this one is good ancillary material for more reluctant readers or those struggling to find a theme in the pages of something supposed to be watched 
another fine effort by criterion once again criterion does a classic movie justice the digital transfer is x better than previous versions available on dvd and the extras are strong as usual 
very original comedy this movie was well thought out and is not one of those movies wear an actor uses a catch phrase that he did in other movies however the sequel be cool basicly re hashes the same jokes in this movie with a similar storyline 
pretty good movie but i have read all of the alex cross novels and as great an actor as morgan freeman is he is terribly mis cast as alex cross cross is described as a year old muhammad ali look alike not even close of course there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of dallasas with most books made into movies something is missing i think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book all that said i did enjoy the movie there are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained 
nice date night movie add one part love story and one part baseball sports flick and you have a great date night movie ! this is a wonderful movie to watch kelly preston and kevin costner do really great jobs of playing their roles in this movie but more importantly the storyline is really well done costner plays an aging professional pitcher at the end of his career on the last game he pitches we see not only what is going on in his mind as a professional pitcher but also flashbacks of his career over the years and his on again off again romantic relationship with preston s character definitely worth watchin 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
classic this is a classic for any hardcore skier or random gen xer i remember my friend rented a vcr so we could watch it many many classic lines in here and gratuitous nudity galore 
the use of violence as a solution to all problems klaatu this comes from our own planet but if you threaten to extend your violence this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder your choice is simple join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration we shall be waiting for your answer the decision rests with you imdbthe day the earth stood still was one of the first movies in the s to explore space travel and to provide a warning that the use of violence as a solution to all problems is an issue we need to face all these years later we are still on this path and these words have not been taken seriously this movie is known as the best science fiction movie ever written years later it still stands up patricia neal had no idea this would be the case and had trouble keeping a straight face while reciting her lines michael rennie as klaatu carpenter as the spaceman who came to earth to give us a warning he takes up the persona of mr carpenter and unfortunately is not taken seriously until it is too late one of the reasons that michael rennie was cast as klaatu was because he was generally unknown to american audiences and would be more readily accepted as an alien than a more recognizable actor patricia neal as helen benson is one of the few who does take him seriously and with her son bobby a young billy gray comes to love mr carpenter the world becomes afraid of this unknown spaceman and of course we do him wrong this black and white film won the golden globe in for promoting international understanding why oh why do we not have such an award today one piece of trivia is that although he was already signed to play the einstein like professor barnhardt the studio wanted to remove sam jaffe as a result of the political witch hunts that were then underway producer julian blaklaatu now we do not pretend to have achieved perfection but we do have a system and it works i came here to give you these facts it is no concern of ours how you run yustein appealed to studio chief darryl f zanuck zanuck allowed jaffe to play the role but it would be jaffe s last hollywood film until the late s in other words it s not that these advanced worlds are a bunch of peace loving little green men in fact they are governments that have voluntarily subjugated their sovereignty to a fascist organization that threatens them with annihilation unless they remain on the up andup klaatu s greatest hope for the people of earth is that we can become enlightened enough to join his little group no thanks that s not peace as a choice that s the kind of peace that s kept by threats and intimidation the kind of peace of people who would name a missile a peacekeeper or a patriot matt baileythe film is good at explaining how misunderstandings can develop between ordinary people and between nations and how easily fear can overwhelm reason and understanding we also realize that optimism about the nature of human beings and our ease of resorting to violence and fear of the unknown is not our greatest virtue highly recommended prisrob 
marvin and bronson at their best this film is a masterpiece for action and adventure great scenery and an ending where all the good guys win brilliant 
a great leadership movie as an active duty air force officer this has to be by far the best leadership movie ever for newly commissioned officers and nco s 
sir gielgud steals the show as others have noted arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the s screwball my man godfrey genre it is an effectively told outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies however without sir john gielgud a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood the film s faults would be much more apparent he elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection he is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility and the title song is a classic 
all starfun this is one of the best crazy comedies of the s surprises stand in line and the entire cast is at its peek anita morris bette midler helen slater judge reinhold and danny devito are all of oscar material in this classic 
alice and another woman these are my favorites woody allen s movies they are so human with a touch of humor i just love themwoody knows women as no other movie director does bravo 
excellant collection this is excellent dvd video collection very good picture quality and sounds worth to purchase it do not think twice 
where are the other moto films this is a good entry in the mr moto canon which comprises films made between it is not my favorite however mr moto takes a vacation with excellent performances by lionel atwill and joseph schildkraut is the best of those i ve seen however they have been very hard to find and i ve only seen about half of them lorre is wonderful as the mysterious mr moto and the films are great fun and skilfully made with a host of terrific character actors in addition to atwill and schildkraut leon ames jean hersholt keye luke john carradine george sanders virginia field ricardo cortez maxie rosenbloom and many others all turn in outstanding period performances it is a real shame that more are not being made available i know that art houses sometimes stage special showings and i keep hoping that someone will release all eight on dvd please 
great foreign film most people have a hard time adjusting to foreign films because reading subtitles and trying to watch the film is difficult that s why i love melville s le samourai not much speaking throughout the film equals minimal subtitles this film doesn t require many lines of speech the main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect while trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him my first melville film and i loved it if you like this one you should also see le cercle rouge and especially bob le flambeur 
stars is not enough the true life tale of christy browne the irish playwrite and artist portrayed by the impeccable daniel day lewis day lewis portrayal of the artist afflicted with cerebal palsy is truely astounding and must go down as one of the best acting performances ever both day lewis and brenda fricker longsuffering mother deserved their oscars on this one jim sheridan director has done a magical job in bringing this movie to life heart breaking uplifting tale of surviving and conquering against the odds a definite must see movie 
the greatest documentary ever i ve been a fan of death row records since when they dropped the legendary album the chronic by dr dre and later snoop s legendary debut album doggystyle everything was all good until situations planned or unplanned caused the company to spiral out of control and crumble due to the legal problems dre leaving the company and all things related caused death row s unfortunate and untimely demise now normally i would review what s on the dvd so what i ll do is basically talk about how awesome and real this dvd is as opposed to giving aways what s on the dvd the way the rise and fall of death row is told here by suge dre snoop nate dogg and others in nothing short of amazing we start in the very beginning to when nwa was formed in the mid s to the end when dre left the company all of the information here i knew some of it before i saw it for the first time but the information told here that i didn t know before surprised me times during this film it s so intense that you just can t help being captivated by the content don t believe me in addition to the individuals telling the story look the eyes of lydia harris and simone green as you look their eyes when they tell the parts of the story you re immediately drawn into the emotions of the storytelling also all of the pieces of information are blended together superbly no history and incident is forgotten here and you receive everything you could possibly know about the rise and fall of death row records overall i highly recommend this dvd to any fan long time fans new fans etc you won t regret this purchase and like me after the first viewing you re going to view this dvd repeatedly it s just that good long live death row ! 
sandy do you wanna get laid carnal knowledge directed by mike nichols with jack nicholson art garfunkel candice bergen ann margret in an oscar nominated performance as a sex kitten who wants to marry nicholson s jonathan and carol kane and rita moreno in the small roles is one of the movies that made s so memorable it is also the movie that keeps reminding me why i love jack nicholson of his early years and how grand he was without his jackness which he has developed during all these years sandy garfunkel and jonathan are two college friends and like every straight young and not too young man in the world they are obsessed by girls and move from one relationship to another in the course of almost thirty years nichols and jules feiffer who wrote the play and later adapted it for the screen let us look inside the minds and souls of two educated upper middle class white males and to learn their very intimate thoughts and secrets concerning their plentiful dysfunctional and joyless affairs and it is not a pretty picture boys begin life not liking girls later they don t change they just get horny the film is honest uncomfortable very slick very clever

what i learned after viewing monte walsh spoilers what i learned after viewing monte walshi believe that the movie monte walsh tells me to strive for my desires and dreams because in the movie monte continues doing his job as a cowboy even though he lost his close friends and he continues even with technology taking his job away however at one point he has second thought on whether he is doing the right thing to leave his passion for being a cowboy i saw this movie at my father s house on dvd on september th i never saw or knew that this was a tv special so the first time i saw it was on dvd at one point i never had an intention of seeing this movie until my father recommended it so i decided to watch it in the movie it shows monte and his friends enjoying their jobs as cowboys however at a point he loses his closest friends shorty and chip he lost shorty because out of all the cowboys he had the least experience in the group so he was fired chip however left because he wanted to have a better living so he became a hardware shop owner this reminds me of my passion for the japanese language i have lost many friends who have gone on to do much better things because they thought there wasn t much work that involve the language they might be right but i plan on staying on track and hope to use it in my career technology had put a big burden on monte s job with automobiles making horse obsolete and trains doing the job of moving animals much faster the need for cowboys was decreasing monte didn t even like fences being built because they prevented him from going places and he wanted to travel all over the country even with these advancements he still continued doing his job this was monte s biggest difficulty to overcome but he made it over in the end i have also had a difficulty in my life and it was my ability to socialize this had been a problem for me since i was really young and i wasn t able to make many friends because of it recently i have been getting more social and this difficulty is starting to disappear when monte lost all his friends he had second thoughts on whether to continue his job or not he was considering marriage and even considered an alternative job he was worried about this decision to change so he talked with his fiance martine and she told him that she would love him regardless of what job he had after this conversation he decided that he would continue his job as a cowboy i too have had second thoughts like when i was moving from my mother s house to my father s i was constantly wondering is this the right choice and will i be happier over there in the end i made a good choice and i am glad i made the choice to live with my father i believe that many people have desires that they want to go after and once they watch this film they will want to go after those dreams 
top of the funniest movies i have seen this is a truly funny movie the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night it s a good buy for your dvd collectio 
i see that i heart the huckabees is meant for a selective audience this movie is obviously not for everyone it s not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour s nope instead you get the muscle a cranking huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in this film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart soul and body of every other thing in existence in an ever changing world this film is a big orgy of questioning and who doesn t like questioning this film in its own right is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films huckabees offers us an impressive cast with dustin hoffman lily tomlin jason schwartzman jude law mark wahlberg isabelle huppert one of my favorite international actress s and naomi watts most notable performances by namely dustin hoffman as it s nice to see him in an exceptional role he hasn t really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably s wag the dog it s very nice to see hoffman play a great character as bernard the quirky husband half of the existential detectives also most notable is the performance of mark wahlberg as tommy corn another client of the detectives that befriends albert tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather rides a bike to the fire saying wed all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum mark wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably boogie nights and three kings however this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else the ensemble s performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless the most credit to this movie goes to writer director david o russell russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story but the story is amazingly written the script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that 
a very good and suspenseful thriller i remember watching this film when it first came out in a theatre in manhattan beach california during a time when you got two films for the price of one i remember how fascinating the film was and wondering if microbes were that bad not understanding everything the film discussed i did know that something terrible had happened in a town in new mexico everybody but a baby and an old man had been killed but why did these two humans survive no spoilers moreover when the doctors who are assembled at a secret bio hazard facility courtesy of the u s air force try and figure out what danger earth is in due to this new microbe i sat riveted to my seat i was thrilled at how the directors and special effects people were able to make a film that even a young teenager could enjoy in their race to contain a microbe that has been picked up by a satellite falling back to earth the actors as scientists in the film created an atmosphere of suspense and dread that stayed with me even after i had left the theatre with my older brothers the way in which the film is handled is intelligent there is no silly dialogue and used up time these scientists make you feel as if the entire human race is going to be determined by either their success or failure and that is why this film has stood the test of time there is no cgi in this film yet when you see the microbe and the computer systems at work you get a feeling that this is really happening at least it felt that way as a young boy this film is highly recommended stars 
thoughtful s sci fi logan s run belongs to a class of old school science fiction films which were popular in the early and mid s prior to the beginning of the star wars franchise these films did not rely on non stop action or dazzling special effects but rather on thoughtful intelligent stories intriguing what if scenarios and astute social commentary they included sci fi classics such as soylent green the omega man the andromeda strain westworld and others while the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of logan s run are pretty cheesy it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today s botox era than they were in the s i have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original unfortunately given the recent history of hollywood it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story and replace it with more explosions and perhaps will smith 
awesome this movie is one of the best i ve seen in years if you re tired of the typical hollywood action films and prefer pure psychological suspense and highly surprising endings then u gotta see it ! the special effects are pretty cool also and for those who think the characters actions or the plot itself makes no sense this is mainly sci fi ok nobody said it could happen in real life ! i highly recommend it 
absolutely wonderful especially for the hopeless romantics james caviezel shines as a man obsessed for revenege the character arch of danets youthful and unspoiled trust in people and friends to an elighted and educated man with a thirst revenge alone is a joy to watch no it s not exactly like dumas classic novel but it succeeds in being both a guy movie and a chick flick with its political politics and sword play along with a man scorned by love guy peace also puts in a great performance second to his wonderful momento highly highly recommended 
a must see this is one of the all time classic propaganda pieces of the war here we have the typical american unit made up of boys from texas brooklyn and iowa led by a steely officer dana andrews in a tribute to democracy for my money however the scenery chewing performance of richard loo as the tojo lookalike japanese officer complete with an appliance in his mouth to make his teeth look bigger just like all of the print propaganda characatures of japanese soldiers steals the show loo s line how many people will the white man sacrifice has become a cult classic with my colleagues and i and will likely remain so for some years you ve truly got to see this to believe it 
damn good well if you like the theremin this is an absolute must have this movie is so entertaining and tells you so much all you wanna know it s worth every penny next step i m gonna buy me a theremin 
romance good movie rather racy in light of the rating i thought it probably would have been an x interesting plot and i especially liked the ending 
i want those arms is just fantstic i bought this tape because on most other exercise tapes they don t focus enough on arms so this is the perfect tape if you want to work your arms this tape includes programs each about minutes long with some traditonal moves and some new ones thrown in the best part in both programs is that tamilee webb works the triceps which if your like me is a problem area this tape is great if you only want to do mins on arms and then work on something else maybe i want those buns absor by itself we all have to start some where why not with your arms make them look great with tamilee thanks

science gone awry creates horror on vhs this film is a good example of the classic science fiction theme of the s man through his science takes experimentation of his environment one step too far nature is harmony man s attempts to disrupt that harmony leads to destruction and horror to himself and his loved ones this is a well intentioned poignantly directed and produced film the horror resulting from al david hedison s experiments gone awry are devastating and disturbingly represented in the film s images once seen the viewer can never forget them this is a powerful film even to this day this vhs copy in pan amp scan is very good the colors are rich and the stereo sound is excellent highly recommended

judith brown pam grier what a combo ladies in prison movies is the best idea next to breast implants and we all know pammy don t need those nudity violence one liners sex and the great cat fights pam is the star but judith don t take no back seat ! when farmer man wants to feel pam s melons through the bars he get s more than what he bargained for talk about plowing all these characters pop up again and again in the pam prison series sometimes she the prisoner sometimes the warden and sometimes the revolutionist why does every woman in prison film have to have a revolution anyway well no matter pam and judith like i said are a pair that can t be beat 
reality with humor i love love this movie the thought of pulling a huge trailer like this on a narrow mountain road with a car is as white knuckle as the expressions on lucy and desi s faces imply my father sold and hauled these things in the s and s and the writers must have talked to him when they wrote this it really was as interesting as portrayed and as much fun at times i love the mountain scene when they try to get around those curves with that big honkin thing brought back some very special but tense memories buy this movie because it s a wonderful time for the whole family this is the best 
superb film a bronx tale is about a boy named calegero anello living in the bronx who is torn between two worlds the world of his father played by robert de niro and the world of a local gang leader named sonny played by chazz palminteri the viewer gets to follow calegero or c from the time that he is years old to the time that he is years old in the process calegero c as well as the viewer learn some valuable lessons about life 
scary and wonderful i had waited thirty years to get let s scare jessica to death and now i have it on dvd thanks to this great seller fast delivery too 
john ford s take on africa is good enough it seems like this film has either been poorly edited or shot in quite a hurry because the story plot is not developed well enough things happen too brusquely it has a beautiful photography though interesting scenes and characterizations but it needed more minutes i want to believe that it wasn t ford s intention to tell the story this way but the film is failed nontheless i can t help compare it to hawks hatari great classic or huston s african queen good or many other great directors take on the african splendors as a homage to the best director in film histoy john ford it is a mandatory film to be watched and respected as what it could have really been another great classic 
unflinchingly realistic look at latina gang life in echo park when i first saw this film some five years ago it truly knocked the breath out of me for the first time director allison anders gives us a glimpse into mexican american gang life in east la s echo park from the female perspective this time in the past we have seen our share of male experiences example being zoot suit written by the playwright luis valdez for once we see the gritty side of the gang life as young mexicanas or chicanas depending on who you ask struggle to stay alive amidst rampant drug dealing the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them mi vida loca is actually a trilogy of stories mousie sad girl lowrider and la blue eyes the first is the story of a life long friendship between fellow gang members mousie seidy lopez and sad girl angel aviles these young women are best friends until the day that sad girl sleeps with mousie s boyfriend ernesto jacob vargas and becomes pregnant with his child the world they knew before is ruptured as is their lifelong connection as friends the second story takes a glimpse in lowrider culture this culture is perpetuated by predominantly young chicanos who build their lives around re finishing and airbrushing low rider cars many old school chevies complete with flashy airbrush images example being voluptuous women and gang affiliations trick tires and rims this story is actually a wonderful example of modern magical realism when the car takes on a life of its own the third story is centered around la blue eyes a beautiful brown eyed woman who is writing to a convict that she falls in love with through the exchange of letters the question is when they finally meet will the sum of those letters even measure up to their encounter or has the young woman ultimately been deceived the whole time i reccomend this film if not for the fact that it is compelling but that this is an important culture in society we should all learn something more about a very important study in gang life and how it evolves in a neighborhood that many only hear about on the evening news but never get to know 
an absolute must see set of episodes i thought all three episodes were really great they all possess the elements that make watching these volumes an absolute priority the videos bring out the in west and the master of disguise in gordon the episodes are action packed and dig deep into the rare science fiction which is amazingly and marvelously applied to the setting making quotthe wild wild west quot the best western ever that s just my opinion watch the episodes and see for yourselves 
light hearted a light and breezy production of shakespeare s most renown light and breezy play the cast and director make this look fun and easy which is of course a sure sign of just how much hard work they must have put it into it the sets costumes locations and music are terrific kline steals the show people unfamiliar with shakespeare may find the dialogue difficult at first my advice ignore it sit back enjoy the show and it will magically work it s charm 
panoramic lots of beautiful scenery provides a brilliant backdrop for this hillarious comedy chan and wilson are at their best in this movie and it s hard to imagine a more perfectly executed comedy western the movie is filled with great gags and it s really hard to pick a favorite scene but the gun fightmartial arts fight at the end in the spanish mission out in the middle of nowhere was classic i ve seen plenty of movies featuring both chan and wilson and i d say that both are at the top of their form in this movie 
not as good as the opera on stage but a very good and faithful rendition with exception of being mooned it was up to par the music was great and the acting was great 
informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
sad beautiful and hypnotizing actually i felt i was in love with this film as soon as i saw the very beginning the opening credits against the background of chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music candyman could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense but bernard rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant enchanting and spellbinding film out of it if you re interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won t find it here you will but not in quantities you used to candyman is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what s important where mood is what matters where you are given some food for thought i don t have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film i can only say it s a great achievement of bernard rose as a director besides i guess tony todd virginia madsen and xander berkeley had their best roles played in this feature i don t personally think that s were fertile regarding the horror genre but candyman is a true gem which wouldn t be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times by the way if you don t want to spoil your impression of the film better don t watch candyman parts and they are the average tenage urban legend flicks 
pickpocket brilliantly dissects the human psyche in the shadow of morality robert bresson s genius rests in his awareness that actions often reflect on reality as the action is something that physically affects its surroundings by stripping the scenes from emotions and only displaying the actions with complete strangers the audience gets a sense of genuine presence through the character s actions to further the meaning of the action bresson displays a minimal amount of reactions to the acts taken by the characters such as facial expression or body language it leaves the viewer with the cold atmosphere where the interactions bring out a true sense of what is taking place on the screen with a clear impression without misunderstandings thus the deeds committed within the film tell the truth without the combination of acting and pointless gibberish of words that often blurs the situation through truths half truths and lies interestingly bresson opens the film with a shot of a hand writing down the beginning of self confessional statement which belongs to the main character the initial statement remains enigmatic as the film lyrically transitions the film into progression where the audience will learn what the main character has to confess through superimposing the first scene with a pair of gloved rich female hands and a wad of money it allows the viewer to learn the truth of the confession the gloved hands transfer the money to suited man who enters a line for on site racetrack betting throughout the sequence the hands are fiddling with the cash between the fingers as the protagonist and antihero michel s martin lasalle ogles the wealth switching hands while being within his reach bresson triggers a similar reaction that pavol s dogs experienced when they salivated to the stimuli of the bell as the fingers are fondling the money it helps the audience to identify with michel on various levels such as thinking about what the money could help provide in this opening the audience learns the hands significance as hands are what nurtures the protagonist s actions which will inevitably lead to trouble at first it seems that the internal desire is driven by greed but shortly after michel s first pick pocketing the emotional high of the possibility of apprehension due to the illegal act seems to be one of the motivating factors michel s voice over statement strengthens this notion when he states i was walking on air with the world at my feet clearly he senses an emotional high which also displays emotional arrogance nourished by his recent success however to michel s dismay he goes down in flames as the police arrest him fleeing the scene but they are forced to release him due to lack of evidence in addition his home seems to support the idea that wealth does not have a significant meaning to him as he leaves all his doors unlocked for anyone to enter at any time some of the motivating forces within michel appear to be shame guilt and paranoia these emotions seem to emerge through the oedipus complex that he possesses in relation to his internal desire to pick pockets he knows it is wrong yet the desire overcomes his awareness of its immorality which feeds his feelings of guilt shame and paranoia at the same time the exhilarating stimuli of succeeding as he puts it i was walking on air with the world at my feet is worth the risk of shame these feelings remain throughout the film but as michel becomes a student of a master pickpocket he also begins to defeat his feelings with confidence nonetheless the police remain in a not too far distance to remind him of his illegal activities which allows for shame guilt and paranoia to linger throughout the film pickpocket provides a fascinating tale of a man and his vocation as it allows for the audience to drift into a deeply personal perspective on the motivations that drive a man to do what he does with the help of fyodor dostoyevsky s crime and punishment bresson brings out the psychological and moral aspects of the story however he is far subtler as he does not deal with the axing of a human together with the music and the scene framing the acts of the characters deliver several absorbing ideas in regards to how and why michel acts in the way he does the minimalism that bresson is known for also helps highlight many of these vital aspects of the film as it does draws attention to what truly is important the acts of human beings

immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods

a great addition to the farm i bought this toy for my son to go w his animal sounds farm it s a great addition for the farm he loves the toys and the video 
inspiring compelling and highly watchable military drama this one s been sitting in my collection for a while and i finally popped it in and watched it i m glad i did not only was i treated to an amazing drama but also to the brilliance of sir alec guinness and john mills alec guinness was one of our finest actors and in tunes of glory he is without peer his portrayal of the whiskey loving and irascable jock sinclair is one of the highlights of his estimable career john mills who plays his antithesis is equally memorable as the replacement colonel whose by thebook leadership sets the stage for a clash of wills that is mesmerizing to watch mills plays his role so well his frustration with guinness s sinclair is almost palpable at times colonel barrows s head almost explodes in apoplectic fits sinclair s heavy drinking and jocular exploits is too much for the straight laced barrows and the confrontation between these two large egos can only end in tragedy a great examination of military ritual and tradition and a fine example of superb acting highly recommended 
excellent but sad movie just forget about what critics say about this movie i just watched it for the first time the other day and i thought it was really good ! sure some parts are unexplainable but it s a movie ! it s not real people my opinion is the critics who gave this movie a poor review were just not happy because the movie has a dissappointing ending and for the most part the story is dark all the way through 
great christmas family film absolutely fabulous family film with a heartwarming story and suprisingly good acting leslie nielson was wonderful as santa my family loved this great christmas movie 
the hunger catherine deneuve i have been looking for this vampire movie for awhile i love this movie and am glad i found it 
an unusual sci fi allegory this film is best interpreted in a symbolic and allegorical way the plot is too implausible and riddled with inconsistencies to be taken literally instead what logan s run offers is a bizarre vision of the cult of eternal youth evolving into a police state some of the scenes are riveting such as the early depiction of sanitized mass murder carried out in a spectacular ceremony there are clear references to a commercial culture that glorifies youth and lives in denial about death the world depicted here is at once hedonistic and claustrophobic the environment is a kind of shallow disneyesque paradise from which there is no hope of escape the implicit subtext of the movie that hedonism is a kind of deathtrap is well taken 
sweet cartoon admittedly this show isn t for everyone it can be silly sometimes still it has the potential to be very funny clever and sweet 
a powerful and romantic love story this is a charming flick about two teenage boys who discover their love for one another after harrowing circumstances land them in the same apartment and eventually in the same bed 
the best movie ever i love this movie it is the best movie ever it has so many things that poor hispanics and go through its kind of sterotypical but it is still a good movie yeah it is kinda of rough but it shows so much reality it has sooooooo much drama and things just happen so randomly i love this movie i would watch it every day if i could ! 
best potion for youthfulness this is one of the most original films i have ever seen meryl goldie and bruce work well off of each other which is why the film was a success helen and madeline each woman want earnest and they each seek eternal life when they find out about it helen and madeline are both viscious women this movie is a dark comedy very funny i reccomend this to everyone 
one of akira kurosawa s finest this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film ran is a loose adaptation of shakespeare s king lear and remains one of kurosawa s most popular films it is about an aging feudal lord who divides his land between his three sons the elder sons are satisfied and the younger one becomes corrupt the film is very well made and includes an excellent scene of a burning castle that was constructed and burned solely for the film the costumes are also very well designed and there are many other things about this film which make it very good the criterion dvd has some excellent special features too disc one contains the film with optional audio commentary by stephen prince theatrical trailers and an introduction by sidney lumet disc two contains ak a film about kurosawa directed by chris marker a segment of akira kurosawa it s wonderful to create about the making of the film an interview with actor tatsuya nakadai and a minute montage of storyboard paintings and sketches 
its more than a sci fi comedy gremlins should definately be considered a superior sequel everything about this movie is top notch and for b flicks that usually is not the case even the critics who despised the first gremlins gave this movie good reviews so much creativity was put into this film that it surprises me spielburg didn t return to the project joe dante did return everything from character development stage settings the music and overall story were well thought out and you can tell that the actors enjoyed playing their parts and had a good time on the set gremlins by no means takes itself too seriously the first portion of the movie gives you the impression that it will be rushed though it doesn t end up that way four of the characters including gizmo return from the first gremlins and the gremlins themselves are designed a bit differently though it is definately for the better regarding my comment on the creativity of this movie you must see it for yourself this gremlins sequel superior sequel mind you gets the dvd treatment it deserves like terminator did in terms of bonus features okay terminator had alot more but you get my point each feature is worth viewing and there are also some easter eggs a ka hidden features at first i hoped for a gremlins but i don t see how it would rank up with this one even if you happened to not care much for the first gremlins you still should give gremlins a look i honestly know someone who didn t care too much for gremlins but told me they really enjoyed the sequel 
good if you are familiar with the music this film is very good if you are into factory as a whole if you are watching it just for one band don t you will find yourself disappointed 
how far we ve come when i watched this classic documentary i couldn t help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here we just wouldn t make it what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls body piercing hummers and rap music underneath it all is a heritage that is raw rich and admirable and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now 
excellent true story of a russian serial killer this film is highly recommended this film is based on the true story of andrei chikatilo jeffrey demunn who was the most prolific serial killer in the former soviet union not including stalin the worse mass murderer in soviet history the case is given to a low ranking forensics expert viktor burakov stephen rea whose job it is to solve the mystery of bodies being brought into his morgue burakov constantly fights the bureaucratic idiots who insist there are no such killers in the soviet union they claim it is a western trait with their heads in the sand the investigation is doggedly pursued by burakov colonel fetisov donald sutherland is the only ally that burakov can rely on when burakov requests that the fbi database be used he is admonished by his superiors joss ackland in particular the soviets refuse to admit that they are behind the west in forensics which to them soviets would admit to many failures in the communist system duh the film is very good and although filmed in budapest hungary one gets the feeling that this is indeed the former soviet union the film is highly recommended moreover it gives a good insight into the mindset of the bureaucrats in charge of soviet russia and one of the many reasons communism collapsed in today s russia stars

the begining of one of the most beautifull contemporary stories before the beatles before lennon mcartney there was lennon stucliffe two working class boys from liverpool that loved each other like brothers lennon wanted to conquer the world with his rock and roll band music and stu wanted to show the world his art however stu accepted lennons invitation to make a brief gig in hamburg with the band stu purchased a bass with the money he won seling one of his pieces immediatelly the five guys entered a whole world of hardcore german scene with cavarets bars strip shows gruppies alcohol and illegal substances but in the middle of all that klaus vooorman and his friend astrid two avant garde artists introduced themselves to the band one night at the club they were playing stu and astrid were immediatelly hooked up by each other causing the friendship between lennon and stucliff were even more fractured due to the discrepances in interests booth friends had astrid influenced stu and intruduced him in to this environment of painting literature photography and fashion very different to the rock and roll concept his four friends liked astrid were responsible for the historic registers of the beatles beginings in hamburg due to her pothograpys and later were the inspiration of the stetic concept the band adopted in hair style and wardrobe the guys get a record contract and stu choosed the love of astrid instead of the band dreams it was difficult for lennon who depend emotionaly on stu but it was wrotten on stone the path the band had to follow and the story that we all know stu died briefly afterwards by a brain hemorrage and the fab five became four to be honest we couldnt imagine the beatles in a different way hm 
true gonzo classic this comment may contain spoilers ! anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it i ve encountered enough people over the course of my yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories this has been satirized on the simpsons which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness anyone who has read the book its based on the incredible i am legend by richard matheson knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise and even that is not followed too closely all of the criticisms of the omega man are valid it is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably ludicrously cheesy the villains who should have been more terrifying than even romero s zombies are just crazed albino hippie luddites and the last half of the film once chuck hooks up with rosalind cash and the kiddies is really a let down but the scenes that open the film of heston hefting a cool looking machine gun while decked out in austin powers style finery staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch this was the second movie after s the world the flesh and the devil to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city both films established the visual motif of streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash after years of seeing this on tv a guaranteed late september or early october event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my pacific northwest childhood in the old dark ages before cable tv and the videocassette revolution its nice to see this movie on dvd with a beautiful widescreen transfer it looks and sounds great as a child i always liked the music particularly the surprise party theme that plays when the villains make thir first appearance it rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory 
so adorable i had completely forgotten that this movie existed ! i loved it as a small child my mother let me watch it over and over when i was little because it was so short it s so precious and looks so classic and old fashioned on screen i must admit though that the animation definitely looks old and today s kids may want to watch finding nemo instead

gimmie shelter the stones in their golden era a fantastic behind thescenes rockumentary of the rolling stones during their peak in the early s very highly recommended for any stones fan the commentary is fun and the rare live performance clips are great ! go keef co while in my opinion ladies gentleman the rolling stones contains the the ultimte concert footage of the stones during this period of their career it s not commercially available this is gimmie shelter is simply the best performance of glimmer twins company that you can get at your hands on buy it today i bought this product from amazon com and i suggest that you do the same if you love the stones and this sort of stuff trust me you will not be disappointed 
from the director of prison on fire i wrote off jean claude years ago as a has been but after seeing his impressive performance in in hell i might have to reevaluate the muscles from brussels director ringo lam who s visited the prison genre twice before with the two classic prison on fire films this time has jean claude van damme as a steelworker in bulgaria who is sentenced to life in prison without parole for avenging his wife s murder mild mannered at first you can tell by the way his shirt completely covers his muscles jean claude is eventually taken to the breaking point and forced to wear tank tops and release some van dammage on the crooked guards who pimp out the prettier prisoners and also run an illegal death match fighting league between some of the more bloodthirsty prisoners the fighting not to mention that there s also a good story is what really sets this movie apart from most van damme movies there s no flying and spinning around like a helicopter or exploding a stack of bricks with your big toe here its all gritty realistic bloody knuckle street fighting the best example of that is at one point where van damme looks lost and has to turn around twice before he notices his opponent laying on the ground behind him anybody who s been in a real fight knows how easy it is to get disoriented if van damme made more films like this he might get back in the movie theaters 
whats love got to do with it all i can say is if you are looking for this this is the best place to get it i look here for any dvds before i look any where else 
a surprisingly very good remake american style i have seen la femme nikita and it is a very good film however point of no return is also a very good film more importantly it holds its own very well one of the main characters is bridget fonda as the assassin working for a spy agency that you are never really sure about are they working in the best interests of the country or are they somewhere on the fringe working as a rogue agency within the cia their loyalties are never really delved into however one thing is for sure they are in the business of assassination and it is the way the agency recruits their assassins that make this an interesting film no spoilers enter the main protagonist portrayed by bridget fonda fonda has found herself in a very difficult situation no spoilers moreover it concerns a matter of life or death therefore she feels compelled to work for this agency even though she continously wants out of it gabriel byrne portrays the agent in charge of her assassinations he is an unsympathetic character and you get the feeling that he himself was pulled into the agency in much the same way as fonda however my favorite character is played by harvey keitel known simply as the cleaner he is an agent who cleans up the mistakes that members of the agency create there are some really shocking scenes with him i highly recommend the film don t compare it with the other they are different and both deserving of praise recommended 
shall we dance when i m fairly certain that the world just may not be unfolding as it should the temperature is near and the u s casualties from the war in iraq now have reached over the newscasters rarely give figures of anyone else strictly ballroom is one of a handful of films that always makes me smile set in australia and directed by baz luhrmann it s all about winning the pan pacific grand prix ballroom dancing competition besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors paul mercurio and tara morice the story is one that most of us want to believe that in the end after all that s what happens in romantic comedies boy gets girl ugly duckling becomes suave swan the older generation get a chance to try things again or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children and good triumphs over the cynical bad guys in addition to the fine performances by mercurio and morice the other actors are quite wonderful particularly the hasting parents golden hair color not found in nature and toupees abound as does delicious humor leave it to the aussies to do everything right in a movie 
painted a picture for me having asperger s syndrome i was having trouble picturing what is in the book so when i watched the movie i finally had an idea of what the setting was what came to a surprise to me was that rosalind chao keiko o brien in star trek ds was in it i liked that but i also liked the emotion behind the mothers when they were young especially an mei it was saddening when we saw why suyuan had to leave her two babies behind i can t tell you why that would spoil it i liked this better than the book 
dr katz revisited upon hearing a synopsis of this movie i was immediately reminded of a favorite episode of dr katz bring back dr katz ! and on that basis decided to view pieces of april here katie holmes gets to play the ben katz role of trying to prepare a thanksgiving turkey for her nutso family only instead of burning it fire in the hole ! she discovers that her oven doesn t work at all hence she must go door todoor in her rustic nyc apartment building meanwhile her parents and siblings are piling into the family station wagon in suburban nj for their much anticipated withtrepidation journey when april holmes knocks on the door of a black couple s apartment asking for help the woman s response provides the movie s best laugh outloud moment but then director peter hedges shrewdly spares us the tediousness of april s full blown explanation of her family and her predicament as viewers we are only privy to a limited amount of information this technique provides a certain amount of mystery to the story and serves to maintain one s attention throughout as it s anyone s guess as to just what might happen next pieces of april is not a tired and predictable hackneyed script and all of the actors are well suited for their roles derek luke is april s not yetintroduced to the family boyfriend and patricia clarkson and oliver platt are april s parents there is more to the story regarding april s parents but i won t reveal it here let peter hedges give you a brief background on the special features section of the dvd in a sincerely moving moment pieces of april is a small film but it s no small achievement to produce a holiday movie about family relations and relationships without hype and hokiness congratulations to everyone involved in this project 
no other even comes close this is my absolute favorite biblical epic i will concede to only one flaw and that is jeffrey hunter having blue eyes ! i wish he had worn brown colored contacts otherwise he is the only jesus portrayed in film that i think exudes the kind of persona that i picture jesus having i know two others who feel exactly the same way about king of kings i love this movie from beginning to end and i consider myself blessed to own it ok it is also not scriptural such as does anyone still not know that the three wise men never saw the infant jesus in the manager they saw the child jesus in the home of mary and joseph ! i have yet to see a single biblical movie that is scriptural howeverall other films that have attempted to portray jesus have been a major disappointment for me and i am now awaiting the jesus film to arrive at my library to give it a chance so far i cannot stand most such films such as the horrible jesus of nazareth must be the most unlikeable jesus ever portrayed and the even worse the greatest story ever told the greatest bore ever the robe a perfect stranger ushpizinthe miracle of marcellino the maldonado miracle and the biblical ones ones done by turner such as joseph are wonderful and highly recommended by this christian but for a movie about jesus king of kings has no competition in my opinion 
cant believe its on dvd this is so weird i never thought they would put this on dvd i had the old v hs copy i loaned it to some one never got it back how long has it been out on dvd i dont know how good it did at the movies but its a b movie are there any special features the whole cast are great shannon presby what ever happen to him john philbin also i just cant believe its on dv 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
family great from soup to nuts is a great watch the entire family especially the year old absolutely loved it my husband is a huge laurel and hardy fan now our childred are thanks for making family night a great one 
how could you not have seen this a must for any intelligent person family or library remember innocence the fantasy sequence is very periodthe s but worth every penny 
if you love her let her go sofia coppola takes on conformity in a black comedy about a house of five young girls who are just trying to reach out and grow up in the world if their parents would allow them it is told through the watching voyeuristic eyes of young boys who obsess over the girls mentally emotionally sexually and even intellectually it was pretty good i enjoyed it there really isn t much i feel there is to say about it as it is a pretty self contained little movie coppola satirizes the clean warmth of suburbia without the self indulgence of most artists dealing with conformity i m surprised by the cover descriptions and synopses that talk about this film as if it s a mystery it s about as mysterious as what drives charles kane however the haunting lyricism and dark humor aspects are pretty correct its a pretty good film polarisdi 
one of the best this episode is a classic and is one of the best in the series it explores time travel and alternate time lines and it s storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed

get out of your ghetto breathtaking get past your own discomfort with relating to racial sterotypes and realize that this film is genius a love story at heart and perhaps one of the most profoundly honest and insightful films to date heavy traffic broke the barriers of political correctness before the people who coined that term were even born if nothing else consider what is being said about settling for the familiar and not venturing outside of your personal neighborhood awe inspiring ralph bakshi should be canonized 
camille claudel first saw this film in when it came out purchased this copy after the detroit institute of arts claudel rodin exhibit beautifully filmed poignant portrayal of auguste rodin and camille claudel s tumultuous relationship as artist and protege adjani and depardieu as well as everyone else give powerful performances film dwells more on the sensuality and subsequent madness of the relationship and doesn t focus on the fact that they eventually considered themselves equals in their art how strongly they influenced each other and how much they actually worked together still a good buy and well worth multiple viewings 
one of the best sitcoms on tv quotall in the family quot is of the best sitcoms ever on this cassatte it has lional from the spinoff quotthe jeffersons quot archie meets his future son inlow mike quotthe meathead quot gloria and mike put on a anniversiry party for edith and archie lional from quotthe jeffersons quot visits the bunker house and gloria and mike celebrate their wedding anniversiry this is a funny tape you must buy it 
great movie this is a great movie i think al pacino and robin williams definitely clicked in this movie the plot was excellent and pacino shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time 
a must see this is the episode that introduced quotspeakquot the tick s furry sidekick this is also the episode that sent tens of thousands of high school students running across the school yard yelling spoon this is minutes of harmless entertainment no cursing no graphic violence or useless sex scenes it is a film that is not only suitable for all ages but also fun for all ages the tick in general is the funniest series around and i recommend that one should watch every episode that was aired also if you enjoy the cartoon as much as i did please email and write fox televion and ask them to continue the series 
quotin dreams i walk with you quot somehow i feel that if this film had been even stranger it may have been more critically popular had it not bothered with as linear a storyline and just followed the dream logic plotlines it may have been hailed as a david lynch like fairy tale nightmare add more violence and it could be a dario argento film but instead we have something by neil jordan who gives this film more wonder and magic albeit dark than anyone else could i think it s a great film see it s called in dreams not in logic its surreality is its strength staying visually spectacular at all times and boosted by an absolutely great performance by annette bening i think the plot contrivances are almost subversive of course there are moments of coincidence because that s what happens in dreams moments of opportunity or clarity claireity arrive for our heroine and she takes them in stride the film s general feel is continuously reinforced by the eerie flooded dream village in the reservoir and the fairy tale orchard this is a grim tale alright but its beautiful trippy and saturated in atmosphere killer ending too closing a disturbingly satisfying thriller by a masterful director highly recommended for those who like to dream 
masterful fusion of visual and auditory art call it a statement an analysis fine art a masterful fusion of visual and auditory art i e philip glass at his best koyaanisqatsi shows us the ills of our modern world in a new light it contrasts the beauty and grandeur of our natural world with its destruction despite the date of production the film is applicable to the state of humanity today it is an artist s a monk s view of our hustling bustling lives a fresh world view is presented as if seen through the eyes of first century monk transported in time to the current era it speaks to you at a deep subconscious level this film leaves you with new desires a reason to help make changes and an urge for a more peaceful life koyaanisqatsi is unforgettable

a fascinating slice of pennsylvanian coal mining history the more historically accurate the film the more it tends to drag the molly maguires certainly passes this test ! still it presents a fascinating account of an oppressed people and a wrong headed response which brought them into conflict with the church 
what is wrong with you people this is the best van damme film ever minus the van damme as the leader of a group of street children too mickael jackson anyway this film has great acting even for van damme a great storie great cast roger moore was the high light of the film and the fighting was neat because you get to see many of the world s fighting style s and style of fighters this should have had a video game i have to gave it a star rating because it s that good and some one should have

best disaster film ever the newly released double disc edition of the towering inferno with its enhanced picture and sound not to mention the additional poignancy of its parallels to cements its place in hollywood history as perhaps the greatest fictional disaster film ever 
the best romantic comedy drama of the s people may say that my best friends wedding was the best romantic comedy of the s but i have to say that this one is my all time favorite ! julia roberts is great and banked a lot of bucks for the movie studios however the cutting edge proves you don t need big name stars for a film to excel on all levels you can read what this film is about already i just wanted to say that if you have overlooked this or if it is not in your collection already you are missing out ! stars 
a truly memorable movie i ve watched numerous movies about the holocaust and each one always seems unique europa europa is one such unique movie that stays with you long after viewing it the fact based story follows the adventures of jupp played excellently by marco hofschneider a young jewish teen who loses members of his family in nazi occupied europe spends some time in a bolshevik orphanage and finally ends up amongst the nazis masquerading as an aryan i could not believe how often jupp comes close to revealing himself but always he is pulled back from disaster in the nick of time it may seem incredible and almost unbelievable but if you happen to read true accounts by other holocaust survivors you will find that the incredible and miraculous plays a significant role in saving these victims of nazi propaganda from certain death the lead actor deserves credit for his portrayal of jupp and the movie itself contains enough nail biting moments to keep you on the edge of your seat 
beautiful cannibal masterpeice although ruggero deodatos cannibal hollocaust is probably the gratest cannibal film ever made i must say that his earlier film jungle hollocaust is much more enjoyable the plot isnt anything new to the cannibal genre plane crash people get eaten someone escapes the film was actually original when it first came out what makes jungle hollocaust more enjoyable than other cannibal films is that the main charector isnt dimensional massimo foschis performance is in my opinion one of the greatest horror film performances ever he is truly a great actor and a strong willed man he let a bunch of dirty natives pull on his manhood he is tortured beaten and humiliated the traumutizing acts he experiences transform him into a determined powerful man fighting to survive all this emotional stuff aside the film does have some juicy exploitation to go with it the beautiful me me lai runs around naked allowing for plenty of boob jiggling massimos character rapes lai when she tries to run away from him towards the end of the film she is eaten by her own cannibal tribe massimo ends up escaping in a plane after he kills the cannibal cheif and eats his heart a great ending to an amazing movie im not saying you should expect citizen kane but this movie is a masterpeice if you dont own it allready then buy it now 
regression therapy gone bad s altered states is a very solid science fiction thriller featuring an excellent cast intriguing special effects and an implausible but fascinating premise that man can regress through his prior evolutionary states william hurt starred in his first movie role as jessup a driven but still sympathetic scientist investigating the experience of water filled sensory deprivation tanks after adding a powerful hallucinogenic drug to his sessions jessup seemingly begins to regress to altered states initially as a primitive human then into far more alarming forms a young blair brown co stars as jessup s scientist wife stubbornly in love with jessup but increasingly horrified by his experiments bob balaban and charles haid provide superb supporting performances as fellow scientists pulled into jessup s unconventional experiments the movie follows the results of jessup s experiments and his rocky relationship with the character played by blair brown over several years jessup is compelling as a scientist who has stumbled onto a great secret that seems unbelievable to his fellow scientists almost too late he comes to realize that his experiments may not be reversible the mounting horror of the storyline is accentuated by excellent special effects for the time and a sometimes haunting score this movie is highly recommended to fans of good science fiction and to fans of william hurt

very bad things you have to be in the right mood for this one good movie if you are 
its name is quetzalcoatl but just call it q no matter how preposterous or cliche a film s bare premise may sound if larry cohen s name is attached to it you can be certain that it s an interesting and entertaining piece of cinema cohen s scripts and films are always filled with lots of wild imagery both literal and figurative often complex themes and lots of sophisticated satirical subtext and his opus q the winged serpent is no exception despite whatever the goofy sounding title may seem to imply as usual writer director cohen s tongue incheek film sidesteps the usual horror cliches and instead delivers a fairly tight story interesting characters clever dialog and a ton of subtle yet witty social metaphor and yes there is also a little nudity and gore the titular q is quetzalcoatl a flying serpentine god of the ancient aztecs who has been summoned to modern day manhattan via bizarre sacrificial rituals performed by a contemporary aztec priest since its arrival in the big apple borough the humongous beastie has been swooping down on unsuspecting pedestrians swimmers and sunbathers and chowing down but police are initially skeptical of the eye witness reports of a giant flying reptile but are at a loss for any other explanation enter street thug and opportunist jimmy quinn michael moriarty having inadvertently stumbled across q s nest quinn s willing to give that information to the cops for a price the special fx in q the winged serpent especially the stop motion animation of the serpent itself are admittedly cheesy but the fx aren t really the point as far as cohen is concerned they re just window dressing instead with his usual satiric flair cohen uses the film to take some playful pokes at the modern western lifestyle for example q the winged serpent draws several sardonic parallels between ancient pagan religions and modern christianity notes one cop after learning the details of the aztec sacrificial ritual quotthe victim s heart is ritually removed and presented to the god luckily all we have to do today is eat the wafer and drink the wine thats being civilized quot and in several shots of the chrysler building cohen makes deliberate visual comparisons of the modern architecture to that of ancient aztec temples the acting in the film is pretty good overall and cohen manages to coax an especially outstanding performance from actor michael moriarty in a role that is the opposite of the conservative types that he usually plays moriarty is hilarious yet believable and sympathetic as the dim witted hapless hood who hopes to sell his knowledge of q s whereabouts to city authorities for a cool david carradine of kung fu fame does a pretty good turn as the city detective in charge of the q case and richard roundtree cinema tv s original shaft is delightful as carradine s partner cute candy clark nominated for an oscar for her performance in s american graffiti also does a great job in a minor role as moriarty s live in girlfriend blue underground s dvd release of q the winged serpent is a must have for cohen fans it offers a nearly pristine digital transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio of x enhanced with audio options that include the original mono an excellent stereo remix a dolby track and a dts track bonus features include an informative and entertaining running commentary with cohen and his protege bill lustig as well as a teaser trailer a photo gallery and some dvd romonly goodies in short q the winged serpent may not be cohen s best flick but it s a pretty good one that won t disappoint fans of the writer director or fans of b movie horror and blue underground s dvd is well worth the price of admission 
mom s not too old nor dead and not about to pack it in with the death of her infirmed husband may an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible dead from the neck down and unwelcome in the pseudo sophisticated yuppie homes of her son bobby and his shallow wife helen and paula a self absorbed clinging and minimally talented daughter the central family is anything but warm supportive and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband the mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else as may comes to realize the world is still important to her the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter s boyfriend a carpenter and rough sort may embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him this is the kind of role hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them but they would never appear because of the frank and overt sexuality unglamorous wardrobe little makeup and social commentary on the vapidness of the society most film industry women are involved the performance by the lead actress anne reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face lift hair extensions and liposuction she bares more than her soul for the screen daniel craig is the enabling handyman derrek who beds both mother and daughter he turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow s situation but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen house his aimless character s inability to say no to the ex wife boring girlfriend and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence while good with his hands at building a conservatory he is unable to construct meaning in his life one of the best films from britain in years it is simply adult in its storyline the mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for american audiences to tolerate having no car chase no bling no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by tv starlets and buff studmuffins the mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook send to the retirement home and get out of the way may doesn t know what to do as she is made alive by darren isn t willing to go to the old folks home and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age 
a great series far more complex and feministic than the girls and flapper fashions would have you believe needs to be seen in it s entirity and revived for a modern audience as the series is now an overlooked gem the leads are excellent and follow in the best traditions of such british historical series such as upstairs downstairs if you have never seen it you will not be dissapointed and the lead actresses are extremely good both rada trained and both have worked extensively with the royal shakespeare company 
active stretch physical fitness is not just for the quotyoung and beautiful quot as ann smith ably demonstrates to her video audience she performs each of the seven stretches with enviable grace and flexibility i told my spouse quotif that old woman can do it then so can i quot he thought that would be a good name for the tape ! ann demonstrates each exercise twice the first time she provides a voiceover describing what you re doing the second time you do the same exact exercise the same clip is shown twice with no verbal cuing i would like her to talk a little more about form as you re doing the exercises visual imagery helps me figure out what i m supposed to be doing and whether i m doing it right or not i also wish she would talk you through the second time as well because when i m twisting away from the screen or hanging down my head i can t see what she s doing and i either fall behind her or worry that i will even though these are very short stretch exercises meant to be done each morning it also works to combine them all for a nice minute stretch and it feels great

very good drama of the gulf war this british made fortv movie tells the story of an man sas unit inserted deep behind enemy lines during the first gulf war and ordered to interdict and destroy scud missiles this movie was based upon a book by andy mcnab directed by tom clegg sharpes rifles and stars sean bean sharpes rifles national treasure troy lord of the rings as mcnab murphys law was in full effect on this mission everything that could go wrong went wrong their radios would not function and they were discovered by a goatherder and reported to the iraqi army because the radios were non functional they could not be rescued by helicopter and were forced to hike out miles to the syrian border along the way they were separated and most were eventually killed or captured after being captured they were tortured mcnab claims that during their run for the border the sas team inflicted some casualties on the iraqis including kia this destruction is faithfully depicted in the movie but based upon reading the amazon reviews of mcnab s book it appears that he may have wildly embellished this part of the story be that as it may this was a very good movie considering its low made for television budget it kept me interested throughout and i have no trouble recommending it 
comes a horseman comes a horseman is a romance wrapped in a western the local cattle baron jason robards wants to drive out rancher jane fonda who has hired on local wrangler james caan to help her make it through one more hard year complicating things in this world war ii era tale is the oil company that wants everybody s land with some truly beautiful wide angle photography a plethora of establishing shots and a dearth of tight close ups comes a horseman is an more an actor s than an editor s movie that works as well as it does because it has an excellent cast at the top of their game director alan pakula often pulls the camera back and allows his actors room to discover their character and the meaning of the scene i only had two problems with this movie i felt the ending the final confrontation between bad guy robards and good gal fonda was a bit contrived the other problem was a puzzler weren t their any doctors in cattle country america in a couple of characters get busted up pretty badly in the course of things and they re dumped into a bed with a damp handkerchief on the forehead with nary a doctor in sight it didn t bother me much when caan was laid up without professional medical care but i hated to see poor dodger richard farnsworth treated in such a manner 
i d throw the drowning man a life preserver just finished watching this dvd i m still trying to figure out what i saw i guess i ll have to watch it again with the director s commentary set on it s a little confusing but i gave it stars why i wasn t sure myself i just knew i loved it being a huge dylan fan read the other reviews here and realized why as some others have mentioned director larry charles has done a superb job in filming the musical scenes the camerawork creates a small intimate cafe feel his band is outstanding and bob is in his natural setting when he is performing the cast of goodman bridges cruz lange wilson deliver fine performances if you aren t a dylan fan you may not like this movie but then you wouldn t be reading reviews of masked anonymous would you 
this sequel is better than the first this movie covers a crime most people know nothing about indentity fraud at least they don t know about it until it s too late the inspectors did a great job by adding michael madsen many gangster movies the big apple to the cast he always play an excellent bad guy and doesn t let you down here i see an inspectors in the future 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
youre just like them with a cast as strong as this one theres no wonder the film was a hit i found myself wondering how they got all of these big ticket actors to sign onto the same film and then it hit me this is most likely the film that launched a lot of their careers the story is a brutally honest one about racism in mississippi in the year a young black girl ten years old is raped and beaten by two white red necks and when the young girls father samuel l jackson takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he s arrested and a trial is held the film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly jake mcconaughey as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed kkk as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty the film calls into account morality over law whats right and wrong isn t always black and white and not so easily determined acting on all fronts is strong but it s jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through kevin spacey sandra bullock oliver platt keifer donald sutherland ashley judd and chris cooper all give brilliant performances in this powerhouse of a film that benifits from a great script and a steller cast 
i love it i am one of the few people i know who loves this movie i think it is sweet and weird and funny it does however require a really long attention span which few of my relatives have i think it was alex emma before alex emma but in my opinion it s far better

dreams or nightmares madness or sanity lets scare jessica to death is a bona fide cult horror gem not a lot of people have seen it it s smarter than your average death ngore movie and it leaves you wondering just what the heck is going on here in particular it makes you wonder if the jessica of the title is raving mad or if a vampire really is making the rounds the movie is blessed with wonderfully eerie music and camerawork but it s the blurred line between madness and the supernatural that makes it stand out like a dark gem jessica zohra lampert has just been released from a mental hospital and she and her husband duncan barton heyman want to make a fresh start on a rural farm with pal woody kevin o connor helping out but when they arrive at their new home they find a nomadic hippie girl living in the attic at jessica s insistence emily mariclare costello agrees to stay with them awhile but strange things are happening the townspeople are very hostile towards the newcomers and emily is being trailed by a mysterious girl in a white gown what s worse all the men including woody and duncan seem to be somehow under emily s spell is jessica going insane again or is there a vampire controlling this island one of the best things a horror movie can do is leave you wondering lets scare jessica to death does just that by the finale it leaves us wondering if this is a terrifying reality or the paranoid delusions of a woman who feels threatened by an attractive newcomer and just made up this whole thing about her being an evil seductive vampire a clever plot alone isn t enough to guarantee success though the whole movie feels vaguely spooky and dreamlike with a camera that seems to capture all the mundane things like antique shopping and farm kitchens that makes the all the eerie stuff vanishing corpses swimming specters seem even creepier the climactic creep out comes when the vintage dressed vampire rises out of the water lampert does an amazing job as a woman terrified that her mental illness is coming back but at the same time knowing that what she sees is real and that no one will believe her costello is creepy in a low key uncliched manner when was a vampire last seen in flannel and heyman and o connor are good in their supporting roles lets scare jessica to death is an eerie atmospheric movie with excellent acting that opts for the shivers instead of blood not to be watched after dark 
im in love with you in america is a truly touching and beautiful film elevated by strong performances by everyone involved the film centers on a poor irish family that after the tragic death of their yearold son illegally move to new york s hells kitchen and try and start a new the family consists of parents johnny and sarah paddy considine samantha morton as well as their two daughters christy and ariel sarah emma bolger johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting and they struggle as he fails audition after audition their apartment is just about condemned all their neighbors are crack addicts and worse yet sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect in the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light that light is found in mateo djimon hounsou who while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend it all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first halloween in the states no one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building but mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed as the film progresses and we learn of mateo s condition their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some they need each other the final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes one of happiness mixed with sorrow this is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness as you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you ve known them your whole life this is due mostly to the impressive cast samantha morton hands down delivers the finest performance here i only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category she was above all things supporting she may have beat out renee for the golden statuette regardless her performance was harrowing she captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping djimon hounsou blew me away with very little words but it was paddy that shocked me mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season he was brilliant and deserved some recognition his grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping and don t forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you d swear they weren t acting they became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical cute kids remaining three dimensional and real not hollywoodized and hollow this film is as many have stated classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone it s very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level and this film this rarity does just that

comic classic brought flawlessly to the screen cold comfort farm is a hilarious film that is remarkably faithful to the plot one character does ends up with a different mate than in the book but it actually makes more sense characters and spirit of the novel the film is perfectly cast kate beckinsale is especially good as our heroine flora poste who is unflappable and efficient at tidying up the many messes at cold comfort ian mckellen is also unforgettable and hysterically funny as amos the fire and brimstone preacher farmer all the other actors fulfill their roles well and without a hint of the self consciousness too often seen in film satires the british accents are sometimes a bit difficult for americans to understand but fortunately the dvd comes with close captioning so the viewer doesn t miss a word of the clever script the special features are almost nonexistant except for the trailer and a couple of recommendations but who cares when the film is so special and enjoyable 
a bit of amusement this is a very s style comedy it purports to be risqu and i suppose it was by the standards of that day but it is rather tame by today s standards much of it is dated but that did not stop it from being a fairly enjoyable romp walter matthau and robert morse are the stars of the show they play well of men who are friends and office in the same building both are reportedly happily married men what differentiates them is that matthau s character is a faithful husband while morse is a philanderer matthau s faithfulness however does not keep his eyes from wandering and enjoying the bounties of feminine architecture morse advises him that it is his duty to cheat on his wife if he loves her so that he does not completely lose it in public one day and embarrass everyone he offers to train him up in the tactics and strategies to successfully hoodwink the wife and is taken up on his offer although matthau and morse are the stars the film is filled with cameo appearances by other big names of the time these appearances advance the story by presenting various vignettes describes successes and failures of infidelity these are usually the source of the humor in this film they are well thought out often convoluted or contrived and usually very funny jack benny s penny pinching methods to dump a mistress play particularly well to his public persona while all the immorality is going on the film has a surprise ending just as the big goal is a bout to be achieved it s a fun film but not particularly memorable 
fully entertaining this is a great movie there is nothing you can not like in this movie bruce willis as well as the rest of the cast did a good job in this movie with very good acting the plot is also entertaining with some twists in it the whole thing about how all the family members of bruce are cops is just cool reminded me a little of cop land town of cops but this movie is even better than cop land tom sizemore performance was also noticable even sarah jessica parker was good here currently i only own a vhs copy of the movie but if any one have not seen it yet my advice is to buy the dvd because this movie is worth it and is fully entertaining

a sleeper with some big name actors and a plot about confronting one s own demons i am slightly confused about why this movie is called badge on amazon and the badge on imdb and the rental site netflix that being said the badge is a movie about small town louisiana politics about family struggles about coming to terms with suicidal mothers and homosexual brothers and about the life long struggle for justice in crimes against strippers and transsexuals the plot focuses on the murders of a new orleans transsexual within the conservative lasalle parish the reigning politicos of the parish don t want the alcoholic local boy sheriff played by billy bob thornton to investigate the matter too seriously and draw too much negative attention to the parish sheriff billy bob is willing to play along with the game until his party tries to run him off the ticket for the next election the action is truly about billy bob s sheriff character finding his own true self among the corrupt local and state politicians he manages both to find himself and to serve justice to the underground sex community which serves the state politicians in a no questionsasked deal the filmmakers perfectly portray the atmosphere of lose parishes in louisiana the viewer will be absorbed into the good oldboy network of doing business as well as the desperation of anyone who tries to buck the system or hurt louisiana s political advancement anyone who enjoys this movie should check out billy bob thornton in the sleeper chyrstal 
obscure theme bright film in one of the reviews it s said the movie is severely cut hmm i don t know i didn t have a chance to watch it in cinema and just got the dvd seems fine to me i mean there were plenty scenes of necrophilia so i don t know if it s cut or not of course if the dvd is really censored it d be nice to see the original version but even like this the film delivers beforehand i thought it d be either stupid or it d be some kind of art house dull stuff i was wrong and slightly surprised kissed although is dealing with such an obscure disturbing and hidden matter as necrophilia is done very good it s bright and for everybody it s very sensual and erotic exciting and serious at the same time it s about true love although this love may seem strange to average people it s not an exploitation flick and has nothing sleasy in it it s very romantic and enchanting you ll definately not regret watching it for i bet you haven t seen anything like that before obviously deserves to be seen and liked 
great quality there is a good reason you d want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality isn t very good it s streamed and the bitrate quality is low personally i want to watch survivor on my plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider 
reese witherspoon s oscar came a deacde late better than both seven and natural born killers director matthew bright s freeway is a looseleaf modern view of red riding hood where reese witherspoon plays red traveling to grandma s house only she takes this trip after her prostitute mother and junkie stepdad are arrested she escapes the cluthces of foster care she says goodbye to her fiancee who is then murdered in a driveby shooting she hitches a ride with a psycho who turns out to be a mass murderer she kills a few people ends up in lockup escapes finally makes it to gradma s house where some more bloody action takes place oh yes she has homosexual and heterosexual sex spends a lot of time saying the f word brutalizes most anyone that gets in her way and otherwise creates mayhem for everybody sounds like your typical reese witherspoon role eh no not by a long shot but one thing about her role she is fantastic out of this world great she is twice the actress in this role she was playing june carter cash for which she won an oscar as best actress on the basis of these roles witherspoon must be considered one of the best actresses extant right now as the description here and on amazon indicates this movie presses the envelope of the r rating as far as possible without slipping over into nc there is gory bloody violence throughout this film nudity and more f and fing talk than you heard by matt damon when he played that low class genius at harvard someone told me they said f times in that movie witherspoon herself must say it that many times here but none of this diminishes the astonishing electricity and action that swallows the viewer right from the opening scene where junkie hooker mom gets arrested and weirdo junkie stepdad forces reese to do the nasty while mom s out earning a living there is an uncompromising level of reality in these characterization too although it s clearly an over the top psycho young sutherland plays in an astonishing bit of casting squeeky clean prom queen type brooke shields is cast as the uptight upscale wife to lurid pervent and child molester sutherland whose character is even more disgusting than witherspoon s while everyone wants sutherland rubbed out witherspoon manages to keep viewer sympathy because of for her terrible place in life even throughout her ongoing antisocial activities other players incluidng dan hedaya as a cop with sympathies all over the place contribute a lot to this film this is recommended for viewers unafraid to look inside the dark side of our culture where youngsters like the one witherspoon plays actually exist there is nothing pretty or orderly about this movie much of it seems upside down but it is unrelentingly exciting and is full of action in almost every scene action you may never have seen in a film before 
nice date night movie add one part love story and one part baseball sports flick and you have a great date night movie ! this is a wonderful movie to watch kelly preston and kevin costner do really great jobs of playing their roles in this movie but more importantly the storyline is really well done costner plays an aging professional pitcher at the end of his career on the last game he pitches we see not only what is going on in his mind as a professional pitcher but also flashbacks of his career over the years and his on again off again romantic relationship with preston s character definitely worth watchin 
audacious in subject matter as well as style alain resnais does not neglect the blast of hiroshima by wrapping it with a simple love affairhis film is puzzling but at the same time a compromise a promise a pledge to human society it is too daring by its conventional moral standards distinguished in the way it was done written made and executed hiroshima mon amour is about the fortitude of man with its mental and physical power alain resnais and his writer collaborator marguerite duras combined a love story with an anti bomb story they carry out the horror of hiroshima and the sorrow of a lost first love hiroshima is a tragedy that shocks us while the story of love in nevers makes us cry the story of nevers does not trivialize the story of hiroshima we gasp at the tragedy of hiroshima as we weep over the tragedy at nevers we contemplate a cosmic and a personal problem at the same time hiroshima mon amour is a new kind of film it has great technical ability illustrating hypothesis plus fact there is a close up of emmanuelle riva who has just glanced at eiji okada asleep suddenly there is a brief flash cut of the body of a wounded young man lying in approximately the same position in another place resnais camera moves like a stream from the present to the past and back to the present it cuts back to riva s face and then back to okada asleep and in that split second the technique of the subliminal flash cut used to describe a character s state of mind is born this cut is the key to the film for it is the man whom she calls hiroshima who reminds her of her lover at nevers it is the tragedy of his race that reminds her of the small tragedy of her life this identification is carried through in the most neurotic moments of her recitative when she looks at the japanese and speaks to him as if he were her german lover of fourteen years before hiroshima mon amour reflects image and sound past and present the actual and the remembered hiroshima a city of neon and nevers a city of gray stone the personal and the cosmic a man and a woman concern for the individual and concern for mankind 
best movie of the s i saw this movie when i was and i loved it since because it really does scare you and the fact that it doesn t include nothing that consists sexual scenes like other movies it is really creepy and gives you the chills just to think that mental clowns are in your house trying to kill you i recommend this movie it s the best 
awesome movie i m a huge horror movie fan i m more of a slasher movie kind of guy and normally stay away from the zombie kind of movies as i think they re quite boring i bought this movie because i really though the cover looked cool i know its a stupid reason to buy a movie but i did anyway after watching this movie it has become one of my top favorite movies of all time the cheesey ness is what i love about the movie the acting is pretty awful but i really really love the story line you have to admit for the amount of money this film was shot for it has some really good special effects i think the zombies look way better than more higher budgeted films like dawn of the dead basically if you re really into cheesey s gore zombie movies then this is an absolute must have 
last stand at saber river the movie was excellent and is typical of a tom selleck western it s to bad he is type cast as magnum pi because he is a great portrayer of the westerns and i would love to see him star in more of them 
the master is in near top form ok i love japanese film and kurosawa is my favorite japanese director but even a newbie to film will be hooked i loved every aspect of this film script cinematography acting score choreography sound and of course direction ! this is the complete japanese version includes film not seen in the original us release criterion has put together a great package the quality of this dvd makes it worth the price included in the specials feature is a terrific commentary track one of the best i ve heard covering every aspect of the film kurosawa japanese history and japanese film history only negative i could consider is its somewhat stagy slow opening act i loved this scene especial since most of it was new to me not in original us release but someone new to japanese film might find it dull going and give up on the film before the momentum builds it builds in the next scene a great movie in complete form presented in near pristine condition by a film master in top form this is a star release at any price ! for those of you complaining about the price rent it ! 
it s all in the hands fine horror gem starring peter lorre doing what he does best scaring the daylights out of viewers by going over the deep end into madness he plays a doctor who is in love with frances drake who in turn is married to concert pianist colin clive when clive loses his hands in a train accident lorre gives him new ones that once belonged to a murderer who specialized in knife throwing an idea copied later most memorably in black friday lorre schemes to get rid of clive by killing clive s stepfather with a knife and then getting clive to believe he was the one who did it it comes close to working but drake interferes and when lorre attempts to strangle her clive saves his wife by yep tossing a knife right into lorre lorre is perfect in his role and when he finally snaps and goes into that hysterical laughter wow ! but drake and clive are excellent too and everything about the production from the script to the editing is done with care definitely worth a watch

one of the best films of the hollywood renaissance terrence malick has acquired a tremendous cult following as an auteur but this his first film is the only truly successful one among them and is one of the finest films ever to attempt to capture the donwside of the american dream and to do it without pretentiousness although many films have been inspired by the notorious s killing spree of charlie starkweather and caril fugate from natural born killers to the frighteners badlands is really the only one to resonate in part because it treats its starkweather fugate analogues not as the quintessence of gleeful evil but rather as polite and disaffected making their killing spree all the more astonishing kit carruthers martin sheen is handsome well spoken and very gracious he chastises himself when he speaks ungrammatically and records notes telling children very pietistic and typical homilies about playing fair and listening to minority opinions but acceding to the will of the majority he shoots the father of his girlfriend holly sissy spacek only when the man threatens to deny kit what he feels is fairly his holly and thereafter he uses his gun as a means to rid himself simply of people who attempt to arrest him it becomes basically an adolescent wish fulfillment scenario when kit and holly escape to the forest and build themselves an elaborate treehouse they become like the swiss family robinson or huck and joe on the raft escaping their pursuers the cinematography of the film has been widely praised as has its extremely inventive use of music carl orff s musica poetica as well as songs by mickey and sylvia and nat king cole sheen and spacek could hardly be improved upon in the central roles 
no title this movie hurt me so bad i almost walked out came home and cried on my bed as my husband was folding laundry a vivid memory i retain to this day i have since realized that decaprio who should have gotten an oscar nod here very much resembles my youngest son hence i have trouble watching him in peril so don t be put off by my reaction unless you have such a child too as the last line in the description barely mentions this is from the true life story of the novelist tobias wolff which does give it an immediate authenticity ellen barken and deniro were also good as you would expect but it is the young decaprio whom you can t take your eyes off of he walks away with every scene he is in no mean feat with robert deniro 
brilliant virtually unnoticed by critics and the public you ve probably never heard of this one but it s one of the best teenage coming of age movies not a big budget movie but nonetheless very well made while the basic plot is fairly simple the twists and turns that occur along the way are creative and hilarious the cast put everything into this one excellent performances all around you could tell they believed in this movie clever and funny from start to finish this is a delightful movie

great movie the acting writing and complete look of the film are completely fantastic everything is fantastic but jim carrey steals the scenes in a very good way every time he is on the screen he is pure jim the character he plays on the movie is as if it was written just for him he fits is role perfectly the scenery in the movie is very dark and gloomy which sets the perfect tone for the film the costumes suits and dresses all look great and the entire things comes together very nicely overall this is a must see for fans of jim carrey if you love a good movie you will love this like i said this role was made for jc ! 
still fantastic haven t seen this movie for years but it s still the cult classic i remember with great performances from all still one of my all time favourite films 
inspiring this is both a book and a movie that you need to interact with particularly in a day and age when there is a movement here in canada to try to bring the death penalty back the book is much more in depth than the movie the book profiles the first three men that sr prejean goes to the death chamber with as spiritual director it profiles her mistakes as she journeys down this path for the first few times she witnessed her first execution on april th and she has been advocating against the death penalty since then the book does a great job of showing the disparity in how the death penalty is applied it goes through the studies on its lack of effectiveness and how for the most part it is the poor and the african american who are on death row even if you only read the appendices the book will challenge you to view the death penalty in a different way the movie was the inspiration and starred susan sarandon sarandon was given the book while on a personal retreat at a monastery she came home and gave the book to her partner tim robbins who directed the film together they approached sr prejean who went out and rented bull durham she was a little leery of having them do the film but after meeting with them went ahead with the project the film co stars sean penn as matthew poncelet a compilation of the men in the book the movie while slow moving is incredibly intense and draws you into the drama of waiting for a death when you know the date and time of that approaching death as an interesting aside another good book is forgiving the dead man walking by debbie morris who was one of the victims of robert lee willie from the book debbie always said if they ever made a movie penn would have to play willie because they looked so much alike so read the book and watch the movie and if you want yet another challenging book give forgiving the dead man walking a read also 
innocence revealed though it s a struggle all the way cary grant convicted of arson murder at a factory escapes from death row and holes up at the house of old flame jean arthur she believes he s innocent also staying at the house for the summer is famed law school dean and supreme court appointee ronald coleman coleman is all prim and proper law bythebooks facts only and grant and arthur try to get him to help out grant s case there are some good sparring scenes between grant and coleman fire vs ice irwin shaw worked on the script and it shows and both of course are in love with arthur coleman about to turn grant in on principles changes his mind and helps find the real arsonist killercoleman has always been a somewhat stiff stagey actor but at least here the role fits him arthur is a bit too squeaky that voice of hers but grant is by far the best thing the movie has to offer the plot is not very believable and the ending gets preachy about law in america the corrupt system un blind justice etc etc but the movie is watchable throughout and the script is a good one in a somewhat unusual set of circumstances two endings were shot and preview audiences got to choose the one they liked best they liked grant winning arthur rather than coleman and hooray ! for that 
decidely nasty insects with funny shoes a nasty disease is ravaging the children of manhattan the only way to combat it anyone can think of it is to eradicate the local cockroach population that is acting as carriers enter insect specialist dr susan tyler mira sorvino who fiddles around with the cockroach gene to produce an aggressive new strain the judas breed that preys on normal cockroaches the idea is that it will die out after one generation as all females judases released are sterile but that doesn t seem to work and three years later something nasty seems to be lurking around the subway system some street kids bring tyler an alarming specimen in an old corn flakes box and chuy an autistic little boy starts to notice people with funny funny shoes its a splendid little horror movie one of the best of the s particularly liable to freak you out if you don t like creepy crawlies the first hour is the best while there is still an air of mystery about these strange bugs and there are some beautifully clever scary scenes such as that where chuy goes exploring or where tyler is groping for a dropped torch it has its faults the last half hour or so once the protagonists know what they are up against where it just turns into a chase movie is rather less effective the opening title sequence is a quite shameless rip off of seen and the story surely doesn t surely make a whole not of biological sense for it to be possible in evolutionary terms a single judas bug generation can t be much more than a few minutes long in which case its hugely implausible that as tyler decides there s only a single fertile male in circulation at a given time killing whom off will solve the problem but not to worry this remains a cracking good scary movie 
one of the best episodes i urge everyone out there to download this episode ! this one totally rocks ! shep a wraith and kolya all in one episode ! any episode with shep joe flannigan and kolya are well worth watching ! download this and download every other stargate sg and stargate atlantis episode !

oh yeah opera aka terror at the opera was the first argento movie i ever saw it was fantastic ! great storyline great gore great argento style this movie flowed music was all heavy metal yeah you have to buy the disc version of this film so you will also have the soundtrack the soundtrack in this movie is outstanding great murders great gore great acting great everything argento should be very proud of this film 
irresistible agatha christie s murder mystery adapts well to film and television format it offers the obvious travelogue element provides opportunities for the music and clothing fashions of the day to be presented and its action involves a group of passengers on a journey the film adaptation exploited all these elements lavishly it also incorporated a series of reruns of the principal murder showing how it was possible for almost all of the passengers to have committed it this tv adaptation on a smaller scale in all respects provides enough of the entertainment the suspense and the final shock revelation to add up to a very satisfying treatment many famous actors have portrayed agatha christie s sleuths many have succeeded though few have closely approximated to the originals agatha christie herself would no doubt wish that david suchet could be adorned with a much more luxuriant moustache than the little clip on one seen here 
i m sure it will be good it s about bloody time this film comes out i haven t seen this disc yet but since it is a criterion issue then what the title of this review sez i ll admit if is my favorite film of all time for all kinds of reasons but first and foremost i went to an all boys private school in the us which bore many similarities to the school portrayed in if and if is indeed the operative word if added to only if you haven t seen this film before then i envy you if you have and remember it fondly then it will probably exceed those memories the only negative i can thrust towards this package is the choice of supplements i wish they could have added anderson s the white bus as it is the true transition from this sporting life to if the inclusion of that film since it s under an hour would have made this my nomination for best dvd release of the year but alas maybe someone at warner s will see fit to try to include it on the release of o lucky man whenever that gets it s release somedayifonly for now though midjune and if a reason not to die or go insane 
excellent movie one of jane austen s best the actors could not be any more perfect who can resist a young laurence olivier and the beautiful greer garson 
a masterpiece of subtlety diary of a country priest is not a film about christianity though in many ways it is about faith i see it as more of a meditation on failure indeed meditation is the right word because this is precisely the mood of the viewer while watching this film every sound becomes important we are so used to the cinematic device of a score or musical accompaniment that the silences and dissonances of this movie take us off guard indeed many of the reviewers here have called this film boring i would venture to guess no offence intended that the only reason this film is boring to these people is their blatant refusal to open themselves up to anything other than what they are used to they are like the countess of the film who is so stubborn right up to the end only able to resign herself at the last moment only such attention to detail can bring about the deep spirituality or pscychological probing that one may seek in this film in bresson seek and you shall find 
john grisham s the rainmaker i loved this movie matt damon clare danes danny devito and especially teresa wright give great performances 
bravo pretty village pretty flame provides a rare glimpse and an objective account of the war in bosnia herzegovina in the s the movie tackles the brutality and complexity of a war that has repeatedly fallen victim to distortion and propaganda by different parties with different agendas both direct and indirect players with a high stake in the balkans the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are extraordinary to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their and it really shows the chemistry is amazing very well written and very well presented the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection ! 
a great balanced dramatic comedy about real addiction as an addiction counselor who happens to be an addict and alcoholic in recovery i found the film to a great depiction of various aspects of addiction the satirical comedy scenes of the chanting were delightful and depicted the sense of silliness that most addicts or alcoholics see them as at first the dramatic scenes of withdrawal and attempted suicide are very true the need to change from an addictive social network to a sober support network is also true i loved the horse scene at the end where the main character finally got a sense of spiritual victory when she finally submitted to the need for help this is a film that captures the serious nature of addiction with a hint of humor in a manner that will allow the largest audience to gain insights into addiction and recovery i am using this film in a family systems approaches in addiction course that i teach at a university i also use the film in groups to serve as a conversation starter watch laugh cry and learn 
toya s review this is my all time favorite movie j reed damn i could not play his part an undercover cop playing a drug dealer to bring down a huge drug lord he befriended god and took him down it was really hard for him to do because they had built such a strong bond this movie was really good though ll cool j and omar epps played their roles really well 
wonderful dedicating movie although i m labeled horror buff i just had to write a review of this film depicting the life of famed dr dian fossey heads up to warner brothers for giving us a glimpse into the world of a woman who ultimately gave her life to save and protect the few mountain gorillas remaining in africa dian devoted years of her life to researching and understanding these wonderful primates this film shows dian s vunerable side along with her determined side to do what ever it took to save the gorillas who are supposed to be protected by the parks sigourney weaver shines in her role and was the perfect choice for this movie she approached it with reckless abandon although dian lost her life trying to save the remaining gorillas we get to see how one person was responsible for doing so much for the gorillas with heartwarming scenes with her and her beloved digit to heartbreaking scenes like when she had to turn over pucker the infant gorilla she nursed back to health to a zoo and the horrible death of digit this movie captivates you from beginning to end for anyone who is interested in the few remaining mountain gorillas this movie will really open your eyes and make you route for dian although with a tragic ending with dian s death and burial next to digit it s a true love story not only between her and bob campbell but between her and the gorillas she loved so much i wish i could give this movie more than stars definetly a movie to own and to cherish for her memory will never be forgotten as her work carries on thru the dian fossey gorilla fund international to this day 
i love this movie this is a really great movie i have been waiting forever for it to come out on dvd devito is really good in this role i love the way that he carries his character a very big man in very little shoes peck and miller are also a pleasure to watch in their supporting roles and devito s buggy whip speech in the proxy fight is fantastic it s similar to douglas s greed speech in wall street in that it is an uncomfortable truth but the truth none theless i very happy that this finally came out 
scary potrayal a very scary potrayal when ignorant people are given even a little bit of power a white woman accuses a black man of raping her an all hell breaks loose sane minds are hard to find and a race war breaks out in the rural southlands of florida whereas many innocent people most african americans are killed the touching drama of the story is how a black man and a white man lead a group of displaced black women and children to safety the scenes to capture the spirit on how african americans have overcome some much prejudice and hardship its good to see taht our prsent generation has preached toelrace for one s fellow man lets hope that this continues an that movies like rosewood can hopefully continue to educate people into the evils of prejudice 
hans christian andersen was a christmas present for my neice she loves the old danny kaye movies so it was the perfect addition for her collection 
i enjoyed the season premeir emensely i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again rather than watch episodes i ve already seen enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews if you re paranoid the internet isn t for you keep your private things private and not on networked computers hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
there ve always been people from good and bad families they haven t made any films like this in decades anywhere in the world from a time when the word decency could be used more as a weapon than as a boomerang traditional family values is what we have here exposed without lecturing those film critics that talk so much nonsense about japanese films are just a bunch of hippies with bow ties proletarians in nike shoes john ford himself made many movies like this one where family values are proclaimed and sanctified thru his artistry but critics don t want to see that they only see what they want well here s this director from japan right after wwii giving us a last tour of the good old times when they are about to change sure it s about a father and his lovely daughter but at the same time it s about those times i was talking about the daughter doesn t want to change just like all the decent people wouldn t want to change but it s inevitable it s life s law progress cannot be stopped and daughters must marry off to start a new family maybe new societies there are such things as good and bad families just as there s right and wrong this is a wonderful film but i ve seen more old films like this one and they weren t japanese they were american and european why not give them the same criterion treatment are traditional values only nice when they apply to foreign cultures i see a double standard in these phony critics whatever they say about this film it is not one that disfunctional families can feel identified with 
my man dr smith is a riot in this episode dr smith and the robot go hog wild switching personalities and swapping insults this is a great episode 
stars good movie for a sequel not quite up to the first this movie opens with a bang and doesn t let up it s just not quite as good as the original movie there are some rather glaring gaps that make the movie not quite as believable first how can there be a series of alphabet crimes if they ve only gotten the letter for the second one second near the end it s strange that the first cop cars arrive well in advance of the second and yet there are no other cops around before the second group arrive eddie murphy shines bright his fast talking almost equals the first one the scene in the garage is classic and ties the two movies together with yet another cast member that were in the first hit paul reiser is even more obnoxious this time he just doesn t stop talking he says this isn t my office which correlates to the first with the locker room scene judge reinhold john ashton ronny cox all return successfully continuing their shining roles this time we also get treated to brigitte nielsen as the tall blonde bombshell dean stockwell stuggles does a decent job as the fairly inept charles cain allen garfield joins this movie as the blunt chief who won t listen to anyone and tells everyone else to shutup repeatedly gilbert godfried is hilarious as the c pa certifiable public annoyance he plays a financial advisor in his typical over the top style chris rock stars as a valet trying to figure out how to park a cement truck hugh heffner has a cameo with many of his playmates not as good as the first but ultimately enjoyable if it weren t for the gaps this would ve gotten stars from me 
one of chris funniest movies besides friday and rush hour this has got to be one of chris best performances on film or dvd i bought this movie a long time ago and i m just getting around to rating it now this movie is funny and if you haven t seen this movie i have one question what are you waiting for for eddie murphy to put out a good movie ha you ll be waiting for tha rest of your life go and get this movie today 
send in the clowns plot three brothers casey nathan forrest winters geoffrey brian mchugh and randy sam rockwell are left on their own when their parents leave town for the weekend they decide to visit the local carnival circus even though casey is terrified of clowns and boy is this a bad night to choose ! three anonymous mental patients michael jerome west who is credited as tree bryan weible and david reinecker have escaped and run away to the circus ! after the show is over the real clowns known as cheezo timothy enos bippo frank damiani and dippo karl heinz deuber are slaughtered by the inmates who steal their clothes and makeup for a creepy disguise then again they do seem quite delightfully mad so maybe they actually think they are clowns they eventually find their way to the house of the three brothers and once they realize the residents are home they decide to have a little fun of course to the brothers this will be nothing less than a night of terror ! the inmates for reasons unknown seem to love a good kill and tonight they re gonna give these boys a whole house full of horrific surprises clowns have always been an interest of mine and lately i ve become even more interested so as a horror buff i figured clownhouse had to be the perfect flick for my evilly kooky taste well while there are a few parts of the film that are certainly less than genius i was quite impressed most b movies have to take themselves lightly or they will be a wreck but there are a few of them that try to be full on horror and suspense and accomplish their goal clownhouse wasn t particularly scary to me but i thought for it s lack of comedic approach that it was executed very well the acting isn t all that great but it s not too distracting either once the psycho clowns start doing their business you forget all about any underlying flaws i think the atmosphere was what this was all about not to mention the fact that it was mostly believable almost every scene took a fairly realistic approach to the story this sometimes causes a little boredom here and there but for the most part makes the movie much more entertaining the score often an eerie big topish tune calliope style or with a music box was definitely a pleasant surprise especially the theme which can be heard in its entirety at the end credits and whether you re rooting for the clowns or the brothers there are plenty of good scenes and a few creepy moments to satisfy the viewer the concept alone is a good enough reason to see this but i think salva pushed it to the limit and came out with an enjoyable film for any horror fan to own overall i don t really think i have any complaints for a blockbuster hit this would ve been a bit of a disappointment but for a rarely known b flick i ve got to give it two thumbs way up there aren t any special features besides the theatrical trailer but who needs em 
criterion presents a great package of a great film yes this edition of bicyle thieves costs more than hot contemporary releases but it is well worth it you get a classic film along with great reading material about the film and a bonus dvd explaining why this film is a classic also it sits nicely on any bookshelf i especially recommend this film to younger viewers as a warning againt allowing society and governments to dehumanize its citizens especially the poor this film makes you think about what it means to be a human being something that today s films seem not to do the departed for instance obviously a worthy addition to anyone s film collection 
wanda s opinion this is one of the greatest movies i have watched i know i have probably watched the movie twenty times in the past it has heart and compassion it is absolutely one of the best i have see 
the era is securded this was the first movie to be shot of the six films since this movie has barely any violence in it and only occasional very mild thematic elements in it this movie should be fine for kids ages to years of age and older the reasons why i recommend this for ten and up is because the gags used in this comedy movie are the old school slapstick gags that have been used since s and earlier these old school gags may be to confiscated for kids under the age of ten to understand the other reasons why i recommend this movie for ages ten and up is there are a few brief scenes thrown into the movie occasionally with the use of champaign and other alcoholic drinks in this movie inspector closeau is hot on the trail of a notorious criminal known as the phantom can the young detective catch this thief who has been dogging the police for twenty years find out in the hilarious funny conclusion 
an ace to your face lionel barrymore shines in his interpretation of stephen ashe a brilliant but alcoholic lawyer who succeeds in defending dashing gangster ace wilfong year old gable on a murder charge only to find that his free spirited daughter jan has fallen madly in love with his client jan a fun loving socialite is only too eager to dump her aristocratic boyfriend for the no good gangster barrymore s legendary courtroom scene is still powerful and deeply moving today remade as the girl who had everything in based upon the novel by hollywood columnist adela rogers st john she based the story on her own father this was shearer s seventh talkie feature and it s astonishingly modern for 
brandy throw more brandy this movie is great if you want to spend your time being entertained not dissecting the problems of the world trying to follow multiple plot twists or recoiling in fear whenever someone enters an empty house made at a time when being funny required neither bad language nor scatological humor the only drawback to this film is the annoying character played by natalie wood who was absolutely luminous in west side story jack lemmon tony curtis and peter falk are great by themselves and a riot when together jack lemmon is a stand out in his dual role and the pie fight scene is spectacular alhough the timing of the film drags a bit here and there this is the advantage of dvds one click and you can skip that scene otherwise highly recommended for simple fun 
straight talking frankie with demure kim a great movie i liked this movie because i like the way sinatra talks and sings he is a natural actor always ready with a toughguy quip delivered with perfect pace and vocal variety kim novak for me is a fabulous actress not only is she beautiful but she plays the part of a shy and hesitant starlet perfectly the songs and the story are great both of which i have transfered to my i pod to listen to over and over again 
many writers are dead before we know how great they are director julian schnabel an artist himself has centered his two best known films on fine misunderstood artists basquiat with jeffrey wright was well received and lovingly portrayed the life of fernando arenas in before night falls was a little more complicated but true artistry shows through this writer a victim of castro s cuba had a tough time dealng with his own personal situation as well as his powerful desire to write a fearless powerful performance by javier bardem carries this beyond any simple story mr schnabel managed to get johnny depp to provide a dual role or was it one as a gorgeous transvestite and the other as a nasty lieutenant of the guard olivier martinez unfaithful was strong so many beautiful men in one film acting against type very intriguing cameo appearances from sean penn and the great old character actor pedro armendariz as the grandpa were well integrated the great director hector babenco kiss of the spider woman also has a small role its bardem who carries this to greatness with schnabel s sure hand cinematography was remarkably beautiful for an independent film here s the influence of schnabel always the artist extras on the dvd include a real interview with arenas a short video recollection by schnabel s daughter lola taken during the filming in mexico another longer extra includes a tour of schnabel s art studio which i thought might be a self indulgent trip but is actually quite insightful into the mind of this talented man but it s the remarkable beautiful javier bardem that is the reason to see this film he d won many awards for it including the independent spirit award and an oscar nomination i m very impressed 
quotin dreams i walk with you quot somehow i feel that if this film had been even stranger it may have been more critically popular had it not bothered with as linear a storyline and just followed the dream logic plotlines it may have been hailed as a david lynch like fairy tale nightmare add more violence and it could be a dario argento film but instead we have something by neil jordan who gives this film more wonder and magic albeit dark than anyone else could i think it s a great film see it s called in dreams not in logic its surreality is its strength staying visually spectacular at all times and boosted by an absolutely great performance by annette bening i think the plot contrivances are almost subversive of course there are moments of coincidence because that s what happens in dreams moments of opportunity or clarity claireity arrive for our heroine and she takes them in stride the film s general feel is continuously reinforced by the eerie flooded dream village in the reservoir and the fairy tale orchard this is a grim tale alright but its beautiful trippy and saturated in atmosphere killer ending too closing a disturbingly satisfying thriller by a masterful director highly recommended for those who like to dream 
absorbing biopics as a rule so oversimplify and sentimentalize their subjects that it s rare to find one that presents a plausible picture of a life actually lived to have lived such a brief life as young basquiat did may seem to come to the aid of the minute filmmaker but that this story of a brilliant new york street artist comes across as believable at all is a testament to the performances the script and the direction the only thing really missing in this film is an appreciation of basquiat s works themselves maybe you leave that for the learning channel jeffrey wright is just fine as the troubled and gifted artist who became an overnight sensation in the new york art world and then according to writer director julian schnabel who should know was more or less eaten alive by it and he holds his own with a supporting cast of notables including christopher walken gary oldman dennis hopper parker posey benicio del toro and others including david bowie as a wonderfully sympathetic andy warhol while you may take exception to the accuracy of the film you find yourself accepting it as a portrayal of a certain kind of life that has been regarded from the beginning as larger than life and any resemblance to van gogh is intended from the start the richly varied music track including snatches of miles davis kind of blue is also wonderful 
jfk the case for conspiracy this is the most definative presentation of all the kennedy assasination materials availble for review by far the most factual when all eyewitnesses are interviewed and all the doctors at parkland and all the eyewitnesses at the autopsy are heard there leaves little doubt to the conclusion there s no fluff just fact i own all other presentations and the peter jennings presentation is on the other end of this spectrum the d animation is so ridicolous and unaccurate relative to the zappruder film i can t believe it and neither should you a cartoon which never accounts for the rd bullet hitting the president in the back as shown on zappruder film and no interviews with the parkland doctors or bethesda staff of x ray teams who say that s not the x rays we took what kind of reporting is that john kennedy has been dead a long long time now and the events that occured the day he died are more than just a compelling story it s hard or mabey not so hard to believe that a grand conspiricy took place because kennedy had an agenda that did not set well with many people from many powerful places inside and outside government the mission was accomplished it dosn t matter who did it but it does matter that more than person did although the congressional panel concluded that as fact that s as far and as much as we will ever get if you want to know what happened and get on with your life jfk the case for conspiracy is the only choice if you just want the facts and hear the real eyewitnessees tell the story 
the blueprint for all the slasher movies to come thats right even halloween this is one of those gem that sliped under the waves in that is really very creepy and still holds up well today a killer we never know anything about him but in the case of this film it works and serves to make the tension that much higher has entered the attic of a soroity house around christmas time and begins to taunt and kill the girls still left in the house it s that simple and that great bob porkys clark take the plot and makes the most of it and although both films are different just like a christmas story has made a classic that still works after all these years now don t get mad at that statement i just mean that just as that movie has proved to be a classic of movie history so this movie should be thought of also put the kids to bed turn the lights on and unplug the phone and enjoy this on

a visually astounding film that works on most levels it attempts the cell is a rather difficult film to classify if you read the plot outline a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim you might think it s a thriller with a touch of science fiction but that doesn t really do this movie justice there is a fantasy aspect within the sub conscious minds that is stunning with lavish visuals and incredible mind tripping scenarios there is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist played by lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing and there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer s evil persona the movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will while i feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience i find it to be completely fascinating right from the opening credits with lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress you will know that you are in for a visual treat every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her patients they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight the costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour the camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same the characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature if you don t enjoy anything else about the cell you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes the casting is top notch also jennifer lopez is in her element here utilizing her natural compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings makeup and costumes she is incredibly sexy and i personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further vince vaughn is fairly convincing as an fbi agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman but it is without a doubt vincent d onofrio that has the biggest impression here it s an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer we are disgusted at his actions yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life he looks magnificently powerful within his realm yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world it s a great performance from an underrated actor while the cell doesn t work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts some of the actions of the characters are not believable and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic it is an occasionally shocking visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings 
playing in charlie brown field i remember when this st came out at years old i had no idea what arbor day was all about no it s not quotthe day all the ships come sailing into the arbor quot as sally brown guesses in class and gets laughed at peppermint patty challenges old chuck to a game at his new field which looks more like a garden than a baseball field not exactly peppermint patty s idea of a perfect field lucy makes poor schroeder promise her a kiss if she hits a home run ! note this was vince guaraldi s final peanuts score as he would pass away the following year 
lotte berk kicks butt i m in my mid s and this is the first exercise video i ever bought because the model doing the backbend on the cover caught my eye im big on flexibility i d never even heard of lotte berk before the editorials that wrote lotte berk is a good workout without breaking a sweat lied ! i sweat and my body parts trembled as i held on trying to get through the reps i m very active and usually exercise outdoors biking jogging hiking kayaking but lotte berk found muscles that i obviously wasn t using and i was impressed lastly i think the instructors are classy and i want to look as fit and sexy as they do so of course i bought the rest of the series lotte berk kicks butt ! 
passion of mind entertwined with passionate bodies the film is well titled and is full of intrigue and mis direction yet it always returns to its central theme of over arching sexuality and attractiveness 
an unusual sci fi allegory this film is best interpreted in a symbolic and allegorical way the plot is too implausible and riddled with inconsistencies to be taken literally instead what logan s run offers is a bizarre vision of the cult of eternal youth evolving into a police state some of the scenes are riveting such as the early depiction of sanitized mass murder carried out in a spectacular ceremony there are clear references to a commercial culture that glorifies youth and lives in denial about death the world depicted here is at once hedonistic and claustrophobic the environment is a kind of shallow disneyesque paradise from which there is no hope of escape the implicit subtext of the movie that hedonism is a kind of deathtrap is well taken 
artistporn i like to watch this film because it is a good film especialy for adul 
great classic for a great price with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all ive bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch 
a minor classic s crimes of passion at first seems like some trashy s hip tale about a woman s double life as a stylish hooker but what we really get is a disturbing stylish minute analysis of the nature of sex desire and relationships featuring some utterly fascinating characters who despite their over thetop behavior are weirdly compelling and believable anthony perkins is intense as the off thehandle violent street corner reverend who becomes infatuated with china blue and his idea of purifying her when he sings hallelujah come on get happy to a tied up horrified kathleen turner and then proceeds to don turner s china blue outfit we are in pure demented psycho territory you can t take your eyes off of kathleen turner as joanna crane china blue she is at her most beautiful here despite a silly blonde fright wig that she wears when in her china blue role director ken russell is at his flamboyant best here intercutting wild erotic art ranging from japanese prints to aubrey beardsley lithographs to undercut the intense scenes a great synth based rick wakeman score of strawbs fame fills the movie with a weird tension

generally speaking one of the better performances i ve seen from travola with that said i liked the story line and the plots twists and turns i would have liked to have seen more stories with this character made as i am an avid fan for detective stories and what not 
good cast great film this is one of the better films of this genre picture quality and sound are excellent 
a very funny satirical and time capsule look at the s this movie will loose some of it s original appeal and humor in the heightened atmosphere of the polically correctness of the s but this movie did break new ground in the days when we used to laugh at ourselves on the other hand some of the skits are on the stupid side and may turn off a few viewers 
one of my favorite movies no its not classy no one uses sharp flashy camera moves to wow the viewer the plot line is neither deep nor inriching for the soul still sgt bilko is an incredibly funny movie that shows steve martin at his height of comedy the story which involves steve martin as a sargeant who uses his motor pool as a small casino for the soldiers on the base behind his superior s back is outrageously funny and sends that viewer from beginning to end without becoming belabored bottom line this is a great movie that cane be enjoyed by anyone 
fox has not taste once again fox has cancelled a brilliant show while it is occasionally a bit off color the dialogue is brilliant but apparently people couldn t follow the episodes so no one watched this great show and it was cancelled i haven t tried the download option but i highly recommend the show

ripe for the picking a bit campy in spots a bit ahead of its time in others westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy happy hollywood introduce an all star cast at the beginning split them up to the three different worlds and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate only to find themselves in medieval world repeat formula for the second part adding in the characters who went off to that park then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at roman world for the big third film finale seriously why is somebody not making this already

excellent and well worth it in the directors cut i saw this originally in the vhs theatrical release mid s this directors cut is streets ahead of the original theatrical version it is hard to pigeon hole barker in film since his work is so diverse compare lord of illusion with nightbreed the characters of swann and d mour are so tired and flat because they are so obviously world weary at least that is my take on the characters how else should kevin have played swann especially since swann so willingly gives up his life as for the followers it specifically says in the film you are all sheep but i m not your shepherd nix was always focused on swann like most of barkers work he has a structured mythology and the commentary barker gives shows that he is at least partly tutored in show level magic and to anyone familiar with occult works even from a crowley ian viewpoint barker has some schooling in that side of things in part i suspect barker is playing to a small audience who know but he has proven his ability to be popular with films so i suspect that barker does what he wants and he is the arbiter of his own work works well if you are in on the joke but it also works well just as great entertainment thats the ambiguity and the entertainment value which is clive barker

ginger takes center stage dvd review in this eighth installment of fred ginger films ginger displays her talents not only as a dancer but also as an actress and a singer she performs all three simultaneously in the yam she causes mischief while under the hypnotic influence of tony flagg fred astaire throwing sticks and dinner rolls breaking glass driving erratically and shooting skeet the psychiatry is definitely unconventional but it is a comedy after all the slow motion dancing in the dream sequence is very smooth and kind of cool a running joke where aunt cora luella gear keeps telling judge joe travers clarence kolb to sit down adds a couple of more laughs typecasting prevails here look for hattie mcdaniel gone with the wind playing a maid here too in the vintage short public jitterbug no a group of feds is out to catch jitterbug dancer the tap dancing is superb the cigarette and match eating routine is a neat trick run time in the wb cartoon september in the rain the labels of packaged goods in a general store come to life and perform a written preface comments on how racist it is however the stereotyping did not bother me and i would not have even noticed if they did not point it out nevertheless i am glad they were sensitive about it run time note no featurette running commentary or theatrical trailer is on this dvd which is why i gave it four stars instead of five

one of the greatest miniseries the is have to offer herman wouk s book winds of war became a bestseller upon its publication just like its sequel war and remembrance a few years later these thick books joining the fictional and historical events during second world war provided the subject matter for one of the greatest achievements in the history of the tv miniseries this dvd set covers the first book with an hour series shot in the plot concerns a military family named henry scattered and absorbed by the winds of war we follow the patriarch victor pug henry robert mitchum an experienced military officer who in the spring is appointed to be a military attach for the usa in berlin he is accompanied by his dotty and yet quite likable wife rhoda polly bergen their children include an oldest son the flyboy warren ben murphy another son byron janmichael vincent who is in italy and falls in love with a bit older jewish girl natalie ali mcgraw who is the niece of the famous american jewish writer dr aaron jastrow john houseman the daughter madeleine lisa eilbacher is the youngest of the three and works as a radio girl in berlin pugh gets the hint of the atmosphere in the nazi germany of that time like the fact jews are treated second class and predicts the upcoming pact between hitler gnter meisner and stalin both of who he gets to meet during the series byron and natalie witness the first days of war being caught in the midst of warsaw where natalie followed her fianc the american diplomat leslie slote david dukes the series mixes the lives of the henrys with the historical events of the war the occupations of poland and france the blitz in london the nazi invasion of the soviet union the beginnings of the final solution behind the lines of the occupied russian territory the japanese attack on pearl harbor to name a few the last episode of this first part of the story ends with the aftermath of pearl harbor the german offensive is halted on the outskirts of moscow pug goes to command a battleship and fight in the war unsure of his feelings for the beautiful daughter of an old friend victoria tennant byron fights in the submarine while in the meantime natalie who fell in love with byron and bore him a son is left onboard a ship in naples which is awaiting to live for palestine since she and her uncle could not find their way out of fascist italy due to his passport complications the above is just the basic description of the series and despite of what it may seem it is not a soap opera but rather an interesting chronicle of the war and a family influenced by its impact pug henry gets to meet all the important players of the war churchill hitler roosevelt stalin and in this respect is somewhat similar to young indiana jones the war itself is shown from these two viewpoints the henrys and the rest of the fictional characters vs the historical ones hitler and his generals etc there are many things that make this show one of the miniseries highlights of its time one of them is the excellent casting robert mitchum brings his renowned charisma for the character of pug and he does it in an excellent way ali macgraw s headstrong natalie makes a fine contrast to jan michael vincent s younger byron the historical characters are done more than convincingly thusly ralph bellamy is the definite fdr a role he had an opportunity to play years before in the theatre and howard lang makes a believable churchill one must make a special reference to gnter meisner and his portrayal of adolf hitler as it will be seen in the sequel the director and producer dan curtis wanted hitler to be overplayed the reasons remain unknown and one can only guess that he wanted to make it less human in this way gnter meisner the late german actor who played hitler few times during his career although a bit too old for the role managed to keep things under control so despite the fact his fhrer is stiffed and not altogether perfect he manages to give a hint of the evil personage hitler was this is important to note since his successor to the role for war and remembrance the british actor steven berkoff was awful playing the character as a total one dimensional yelling buffoon the role of hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character as shown by bruno ganz in the recent movie downfallone of the other appeals of the show is the fact it was shot on location with attention put to details that make the historical accuracy most scenes were shot in my hometown zagreb the capital of croatia then still part of ex yugoslavia the producers managed to use zagreb s past as one of the former austro hungarian capitals to recreate berlin lisbon warsaw etc the scenery and the costumes evoke the era perfectly thus making the whole thing believable to the viewer other locations included usa italy and some more but the greatest asset is without the doubt the interesting plot which doesn t let go for a moment it is also noticeable that some of the mistakes that were made in the sequel war and remembrance the narrow scope of the victims of the holocaust being one of them are not present here one can only get a hint of some of the future slips here for example the subtle message that all the germans are bad and all americans good this dvd collection of the series deserves a seven dvds come packed in a nice sleeve besides the series there are several interesting extra features through the interviews with the cast crew and herman wouk we learn about the process of adaptation casting shooting and the problems they all encountered while making this epic peace some of the footage includes things shot during the work on location in zagreb for anyone enjoying modern history an excellent miniseries with the interesting plot or is simply interested in second world war this is a must have highly recommendable 
awesome this is the greatest movie that i have ever seen it is funny and the cast does some sweet moves i personally like the king of the mountain part anytime by eve and makes no differece by sum is sweet 
bob fosse bob fosse was probably one of the greatest directors of usa and dustin hoffman is one of the best actors of usa what happens when you put them together they ll create a masterpiece like this one 
when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young

talk about jason this item was something that was needed in my collection it was shipped promptly and it was received in the condition that was described 
i just met a wonderful new man he s fictional but you can t have everything woody allen s the purple rose of cairo ranks among his better films the film centers on the experiences of a poor woman named cecilia who is played wonderfully by mia farrow cecilia is trapped in a loveless marriage to a brute named monk who is played by danny aiello cecilia has a job as a waitress in a small diner during the depression and although she tries to work hard she can t help but fantasize and chat about the movies with her sister who also works at the same diner cecilia s only comfort is in the movie theater watching glamorous but highly contrived movies about rich people who aren t suffering from poverty and the scorn of her husband cecilia eventually loses her job and after catching monk being unfaithful to her she winds up watching the purple rose of cairo endlessly at the small movie theater in their town imagine cecilia s surprise when one of the characters the dashing all american type guy tom baxter decides to leave the film jump from the screen into the audience and run away with cecilia ! tom represents the purity of heart and the true compassion that cecilia longs for in her real marriage she knows tom is fictional because he came off the movie screen but tom maintains he s never going back because he wants to experience the real world with cecilia as his new bride of course all of this horrifies the movie theater manager and the hollywood studio that produced the film entitled the purple rose of cairo how inconvenient this is for gil shepherd too the actor who portrayed tom baxter in the film ! the movie studio executives and gil shepherd hatch a plan to get tom to return to the movie but will it work what would happen if tom returned to the movie but took cecilia with him into the land of make believe the purple rose of cairo is a film you cannot afford to miss mia farrow as cecilia danny aiello as monk cecilia s husband and jeff daniels as both gil and tom all give some of the most convincing performances i ve ever seen their performances moved me and engaged my attention much longer than i initially thought they would this movie deals with the universal human desire to escape the pain and boredom of everyday life so many of us experience and to replace that misery with a world in which there are no real problems and everyone has money or at the very least a secure job cecilia represents us all as she delights to tom s world of relative innocence and harmony therein lies the true strength of this film the cinematography shines i like the scenes in the movie house where you see the film being screened within woody allen s picture the scenes filmed in the amusement park reflect careful forethought concerning lighting and camera angles the choreography amazes me i love the scenes in which both the movie theater patrons and the actors in the film are stunned by tom s decision to leave the movie and they all move about simultaneously in ways that prove good judgment on the part of woody allen and his colleagues who worked on this film overall the purple rose of cairo will remain an excellent film as long as the human condition and the quality of our lives are imperfect everybody dreams of a world where their true desires are reality and their troubles disappear the purple rose of cairo elegantly explores this theme with sophistication wit and poignancy 
re best batman animated crossover i always loved cross overs especially in animation the first teamup between batman and superman was as expected filled with tension both over lois lane and especially the way things are done both heroes take some time to find some footing with each other and learning to work together before their super villains try to take them out this character development was accomplished to an amazing degree watching the movie you could really feel the emotions coming from them why do voice actors get little respect in this country there should be an award for them specifically kevin conroy will always be batman in my mind and mark hamil as the joker even tim daly does a fine job as superman dana delany as lois lane is always terrific and makes this lois sexy and personable the animation was superb it was almost as good as some japanese animation the batman cartoons are by far the best american animation i ve ever seen batman brought the best out of superman and the joker well is always as scene stealing as ever i never felt lex luthor was that much of a super villain no offense to those who like lex and superman s world i mean he s ruthless and a genius and all but he is no joker the one character i felt sorry for was mercy lexs assistant geez she got beat up a lot in this episode by harley batman unfortunately the music was not as good as it could have been considering this was the first meeting between the man of steel and the caped crusader it should have been more intense and fiery oh well otherwise i have no complaints whenever superman crosses over to batman s world he becomes a better hero 
oh yes the killer is rightly considered one of the greatest action movies ever personally my vote for greatest action movie would have to go to aliens but the killer definitely isn t far off the main reason the killer is so fantastic is because woo understands what an action movie oughta be it s not about the explosions or car chases though an action movie certainly can benefit from these things it s about the shooting lots and lotsa shooting and this movie s got that and yet it s got a lot of human interest and it s even kind of touching at times though the stuff with jenny s blindness is perhaps a bit too melodramatic yun fats jeffrey is pretty much the ultimate action hero as he gets the standard action hero mix just right he s tough and ruthless enough to be really cool but still has enough of a heart that you can like him personally perhaps the next greatest key to the killer s success is the fantastic pacing most action movies have all the good violence stuffed into a couple scenes and much of the rest of the movie is actually pretty boring and uneventful the killer avoids these flaws by being pretty fast paced and not making any of the individual action scenes prior to the climax too long the action s never far off and no seen is ever dragged out longer than it needs to be that and again it actually has character s worth caring about unlike most action movies so the non action scenes are actually of some interest though woo s style is immensely influential none can match it though he cites a number of influences he could most basically be described as peckinpah taken to the next level with the countless edits multiple angles and alternation between slow motion and regular speed that that description implies also he manages to ratchet up both the gruesomeness and the elegance in these scenes simultaneously and finally he manages to make the scenes as frantic and as wild as possible without losing any coherence take note modern filmmakers personally i think the first shootout may be the best one though it perhaps just makes the biggest impression from being first the closing one is perhaps slightly too much but it s still quite awesome also the scene between jeffrey and sydney just after he s been betrayed ahh fantastic particularly the major reversal best moment in the film ehh action movies are too hard to review just remember this is an action movie taken back to the basics ie the shootout but taken about as far as possible at the same time grade 
i love the warm up exercises it s been ages since i used this tape so i forgot how good the warm up excercises made me feel but this morning i pulled it from the shelf and gave it another try to be honest i haven t even come close to mastering all the instructions on this video but the warm up alone will make you feel great and i hope to use this tape more often why and how does it work who can say i just know that i feel better and more relaxed i sincerely hope it does the same for you

epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
the way things should be anne of green gables shows how a combination of love honesty hard work tolerance and integrity is the perfect mix for bringing out the best from the potential in anyone even in a non traditional family it s an incredibly refreshing break from today s society where lying and manipulation have become almost a norm in much of the world we know 
brilliant this is typically the kind of movie that we would like to watch more often everything is well thought and it doesn t try tobe spectacular to get deeper into the subject roots of terrorism conditions of despair cyniscism and greed are the elements assembled like a puzzle to explain the complexity of our world where a few wealthy control the destiny of the majority but in the end someone has to pay the pric 
great concert film be sure to catch the alternate views on disk the view from the control booth with the director losing his mind in a good way is great they also have a beautiful day from the rooftop in boston 
classic sport melodrama bollywood loves to churn out action films but the indians could learn some lessons from the jewish american cartel in hollywood concerning story construction from this classic sport melodrama presented in the traditional three act format three minute blocks to produce a hour movie much is done brilliantly in the construction of the film and its story in the opening scene the antagonist is introduced and hooks the viewer when she reveals the premise and plot a rotten season where attendance falls below for the year will allow her to escape her lease with the city and relocate her recently inherited cleveland indians baseball team to miami so she s invited has beens and screwballs to training camp with the aim of composing a team that stinks enough to cause attendance to drop the remainder of the scenes in the first act introduce the protagonist the catcher played by tom beringer and all the main characters team coach born again pitcher voodoo man pretty boy willy mays hayes and wild thing nice subplots and tensions are introduced between these unforgettable characters after which the main subplot is presented between the catcher and his ex fiancee all of these characters have no idea that the team s new owner expects them to stink they re all playing and coaching with determination but act one ends with them playing their first game and losing act two opens with a scene in the office where the owner is complaining to the general manager that the team is bad but it doesn t stink and she complains that there is even some improvement so she increases the complications for the characters by taking away their perks and making them fly in a propeller plane rather than a jet while they continue to lose subplots and tensions continue between the characters however they also continue to show improvement especially when coach notices that wild thing s pitching would improve if he wore glasses the owner responds with more complications their propeller plane is replaced by a bus by the end of act two their record is wins and losses that s when the plot is given its turning point coach finds out that none of them will have a job in baseball after the season ends because they were hired to lose after coach shares this with the players the catcher says there is only one option available to them win the whole darn thing as winners they could work for another team next season the players will need victories to stay in baseball after this season act three begins victories later when they have to play the yankees for the championship who they ve struggled against all season this act is minutes of inning byinning action conflict and suspense in melodramatic fashion they win ! it s an awesome climax to a succession of dramatic suspense scenes and in hollywood subplot fashion the catcher gets his girl 
what price are we willing to pay for as i write this review i am two days removed from hearing of the tragic and senseless suicide of an acquaintance who had it all risked it all lost his family fell into depression and substance abuse and hung himself whyhis life was his startup and it came crashing down around him and he couldn t bear it startupcom is a timeless look at the rise and fall of businesses and the people who rise and fall with them some people who will view this film will only want to know one thing how do i succeed in building a business and make money others will view this film and learn about the trmendous sacrifices to self and interpersonal relationships that comes from examining the failures of others driven by an intense desire or need to succeedthis documentary examines both aspects of business the technical and the personal the two aspects are always competing the lives of the twentysomethingfounders of gov workscom are examined in intimate detail as kaleil and tom are followed from the infancy stage of their internet organization through it s quick rise to fame they were on every major mag cover and even had audience with president clinton and it s crashing in months loyalties and passions are questioned this is a very realistic look at the down and dirty business world as portrayed in the com rush of a few years back what this film has to teach us is about the price that one pays in blood for what one thinks is necessary for successthis film is a sobering look for anyone any age who needs to possibly reexamine their priorities in business and in life 
catch me if you can and live to tell about it there are two movies that come to mind when i speak of this one lonely are the brave and valdez is coming the same theme in all three of these excellent films the law hunts the fugitive the fugitive portrays the sympathytic hero in all three films in all three the persuer takes a liking to the one he hunts they come to respect his courage and fortitude this movie is full of twists turns thrills and spills excitement suspense not to mention beautiful mountain scenery last but definetly not least lee marvin and charles bronon they alone are worth the price of admission anonymously louie g 
south pacific redux this movie is an excellent rendition of the original broadway production by rodgers and hammerstein that opened in april and ran for years mitzi gaynor and rossano brazzi do very well following the original cast of mary martin and ezo pinza having seen the original play shortly after it opened and as a navy veteran in the same south pacific area during wwii my impressions then make it unfair to compare the impact of the movie with the original all in all it is very good dvd which includes a wealth of information about the filming location and the cast 
beautifully photographed gets medieval on your ss i tend to agree with the high praise here but i have a few thoughts to add first off every shot is beautifully photographed and there are some simply amazing tracking shots in that sense this is an art movie if there ever was one perhaps reflecting it s alleged subject matter little of this seems flamboyant for its own sake another aspect worth note is the medieval feel of the movie at times it really seems as if someone took a film camera back years or so oh and it should be mentioned what tremendous testicles tarkovsky must have had to take as his subject matter in early s russia a renowned medieval icon painter this had to be a mighty thumb of the nose to the soviet state and arguably an act of subversion pacing is slow but no more glacial than movie like or once upon a time in america say but here s the brass tacks for the novices to know this movie is episodic to say the least and the only film i know of wherein the title character takes a lengthy vow of silence when the vow is finally up the movie seems to lose interest in andrei altogether and he becomes a background figure but it s here finally that tarkovsky shows what he can do with a straight ahead narrative although that narrative isn t about andrei it s about the young son of a newly deceased bell maker who insists that his father has told the secrets of bell making only to him it ll mean his head if he s b sing and we as viewers aren t sure and here s where the movie picks up pace and emotional power how much this power relies on the two previous not tooseeminglyconnected hours is hard to say oh and vladimir gets sacked convincingly there are images and scenes that will stick to your ribs it will help if you re already interested in art religion russia or splendid cinematography or bell making come to think of it if one of your neighbors begins a medieval smelting process in their back yard odds are they ve been inspired by this film 
great suspense i saw this movie on lifetime tv and i would have never guessed that the ending would have been so unexpected i can t wait for this movie to come out on video all i have to say is that you need to watch this movie marlee matlin is as convincing as can be this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat regina king who you may have seen in jerry maguire as cuba gooding jr s wife is fantastic in this movie as a lawyer she is one to watch 
a riveting cross country ride with a serial killer i don t know what it is i love most about kalifornia perhaps that it s about a serial killer or the man duchovney who yearns to understand why serial killers behave in the way they do if you enjoy movies about serial killers then this one s for you someone s review said brad pitt can t act and i must strongly disagree oh sure im a woman and i find him attractive but in this movie there s probably very few women who would find his appearance to be pleasing it s a road movie and serial killer movie tied into one fantastic film and i highly recommend this at the very least for anyone who wants to see pitt looking unattractive but also for any fans of juliette lewis you ll love her in this she s terrific as always enjoy 
he s just a boy who can t say no shampoo is probably the most sophisticated sex comedy ever made in this country it s a very clear eyed and very funny look at how love and lust get inextricably mixed up with up with power money position and politics of course contrary to almost every critique posted here george warren beatty the philandering beverly hills hairdresser is the primary victim of the rules of the game late s southern california style unlike the protagonist of the great renoir movie george doesn t end up dead but he s left alone abandoned by all the women he s bedded looking like a naive fool and that s george s sin hes an uncynical romantic in a world that doesn t know the difference between felt emotion and deliberate calculation he sleeps with women because he genuinely likes them for him taking a woman to bed is an extension of doing her hair its an intimate act in which he makes her look and feel better all the other characters in the movie use sex as part of a larger plan they each have some separate goal on their mind which they achieve in one way or another and george is left behind with his silly emotional and sexual vulnerabiliy he s don giovanni in reverse the boy who can t say no because he actually gives a damn and he pays a steep price for his availability playing a slightly out of it dupe beatty has never been better or more dazzlingly glamorous and he s surrounded by a flawless ensemble cast lee grant is simply astonishing as a deceived and deceiving beverly hills matron and julie christie in her flared pants and mini skirts is peerlessy sexy as the version of a rodeo drive courtesan thanks to robert towne shampoo also has some of the most natural unforced yet revealing dialog ever heard in an american movie nothing is stylized or italicized but every nonchalant remark hits target like a polished wilde epigram delectable

hard candy after chatting online for weeks jeff kohlver a year old photographer and hayley stark a year old honors student finally meet in real life at a cozy local coffee shop called nighthawks for a normal person just knowing this age different would make you feel uncomfortable and you would think that what they are doing is wrong but what exactly are they doing nothing illegal yet as hayley attempts to flirt with jeff she is not getting the feedback that she wants sure jeff is replying and some of his replies seem as if they would be very sexual but the way he talks and presents himself to hayley he seems as if he is not interested in her even claiming he would have to wait years for her but when hayley invites herself over to jeff s home he accepts so he must have some interest in her right well he does but he isn t able to make his move as hayley makes her move first after intensive research study and stalking hayley discovered a gruesome past that jeff never wanted to surface which is the only reason hayley met with jeff to do justice to in her own special way our knowledge of jeff and hayley now change jeff kohlver not only a year old photographer but a pedophile and a murderer or at least the accomplice of a murderer hayley stark not only a year old honors student but a vigilante who literally takes the law into her own hands through torture which includes castration stun guns and a call to janelle jeff s ex girlfriend whom he is still obsessed over hayley digs deeper into jeff s memory and the complete truth is out hayley gives jeff two options jeff must commit suicide by hanging himself making others including janelle believe he was just some sad lonely man in return hayley will clean up all the evidence that would lead police to finding out his crimes or she will let jeff live and she ll take off her clothes run into janelle s arms and the truth about jeff about his pedophilia and about his murderous acts will be out to the public and his name will be put to shame jeff chooses suicide and at the last minute hayley tells him she will not hide his past it is now for everyone to know hard candy is a psychological drama with a very unique and twisting storyline and plot one that makes you question the movies the characters and even question yourself what kind of person are you if you side with jeff sure he is a pedophile but does he really deserve all this torture and what kind of person are you if you side with hayley sure she is ridding the world of evil but shouldn t she have just gone to the police most people just get stuck on the storyline and plot itself and don t take time to notice the acting dialogue and cinematography patrick wilson and ellen page did an amazing performance i have never seen better and the dialogue is so impressive and so striking some times heart moving as well as heart chilling as for the cinematography the movie is absolutely beautiful the colors the shots really look at it this movie is definitely a favorite of mine and i give it a

how to be yourself in spite of ignorance of others what a delightful movie full of nuance and beautiful about a boy who loves wearing dresses and a family trying to accomodate him as best they can what is particularly brilliant is that the family tries to help but they are faced as is the boy with the tension between individual desires and the demands of society to live within strict gender roles and expression of those roles a great movie 
anti john wayne this is one of those groundbreaking films that that put the whammy on a genre in this case the western can never come back oaters traditionally are the realm of strong male characters righting wrong loving their horses and ignoring the school marm robert altman a political and cultural man of the s left simply says horse feathers the hero is a corrupt bawdyhouse owner the school marm makes her living in a crude manner and normal everyday middle class types don t really exist in the hardscrabble world of capitalism the town near vancouver canada sits in a mountains and wilderness the film company built the town that s real snow there folks and blizzards as our anti hero beatty shoots it out with the company men while his best girl julie christy hides out in an opium den her brown eyes realistically glassy john wayne s the searchers was one of the best films ever made mccabe mrs miller tries to undo all that fascinating look at the underbelly of frontier life and a forerunner of the hbo series deadwood the west may not be a better place for it 
paradise lost everyone should see this movie also everyone should buy it so they can show it to their friends so the word can keep spreading and hopefully and finally justice will be served 
a movie so bad it s good this movie breaks some story rules including introduction insertion of random new characters towards the end still funny enoughfor a movie that seems to try so hard to be so good and comes out oh so bad grin definitely worth watching 
entertaining camp classic is enjoyable sand and sandals epic maria montez jon hall and sabu made some very entertaining technicolor sand and sandals epics at universal and this dvd restoration showcases them in brilliant technicolor its strictly saturday afternoon matinee stuff nothing to really ponder in the way of complex plots just the usual good vs evil with hall coming to the rescue of beautiful princess montez in her usual damsel in distress kind of role exquisitely photographed on desert sands it s exotic fun fare for adults and children with lots of eye candy to keep things interesting turhan bey is effective in a brief role but it s montez and hall who keep the story moving along at a lively pace well worth viewing and nostalgic fun for fans of the universal series starring this trio of stars 
one of the few artsy films i enjoy like most artsy films the piano is a visual experience and because it s an artsy film it will be hard for me to explain why i liked it so much as previously stated the visual aspect of the film is mesmerizing and amazing it s a great experience what gives this film it s strength is its visual expressiveness meanings are shown through movements gestures expression and of course music not words i did not know of the feminist controversy surrounding this film before i saw it but now that i know about it it still doesn t affect the way i see this film i don t think the point of the film is to make one see her as a strong or weak woman for choosing to do the things she does in her relationships with her husband and his neighbor george but to see that her will is in control at all times she does what she wants all the choices she makes are the choices she made as long as that continues to be true she is still in control of her life and that makes her a strong character performances are strong as well especially anna paquin s character holly hunter as the proud passionate ada harvey keitel as the desiring neightbor and sam neil as the sadly pathetic yet pitiable husband round off the rest of the powerful cast in this powerful movie 
tom drake alfred sinclair quotbuddyquot alderice was fantastic i watched this film at least times it was a wonderful film my all time favourite buddy was aboslutely adorable proving that he was and still remains as the best actor ever 
undefeated a good movie a john wayne movie with a very nice cast the usual harry carye jr ben johnson john agar paul fix and many other great people especially from the time it is great to see merlin olsen and roman gabriel from the football movie actor era the added plus is we have rock hudson in the movie not to forget the movies leading ladies lee meriweather marian mccargo the women are very nice looking and they would be if they were in rock hudson s family the time era of the film is after the american civil war john wayne is your northerner and rock is from the south the deep south john wayne is with his loyal men who are finanical ruined after the war and need to take home money to their families when they return they band together to run a herd legally the rock is a family man who has lost everything even his country the southerns are lured to mexico with false promises and high hopes the northerners are going to do business with mexico also john wayne and the men end up helping the southerns enemies but john wayne and his men have honor and help the southerners most importantly fellow americans the civil war tore us apart and threw us together there are great elements in the movie action lovehonor in people human weaknesses saddnessand some historical correctness the movie is not anyone s best movie but it is not the worse either good entertainment with a good mix of plot and history john wayne and the rock s only movie together the movie shows everyone in such great shape and takes you back to great movie times watch and enjoy 
the most sensuous tarzan as a longtime tarzan aficionado ive read all the books i just had to write a review for this tarzan film because i love it ! yes richard harris is embarrassingly over thetop yes bo s acting is sophomoric yes the plot plods and yes the slo mo snake scene is overlong but ! first the music is exquisite i have searched for years for the soundtrack to this movie ! second the on location filming was first rate the lagoon and tree house were exactly as you would expect tarzan s world to look third the nudity was for the most part appropriate to turn ofthe century africa fourth and most importantly miles o keeffe was an incredibly sexy tarzan ! tarzan is a savage sensuous literary character and this tarzan personifies that image as a gay man i enjoyed watching tarzan as much as i suppose the derek s were hoping straight men were enjoying bo ! now if they had only shown him naked ! now about that soundtrack 
teusdays with mauri terriffic movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt 
my maximum to a true i love stories good stories and sincere love for historical or historical fiction its the story thing so dangerous beauty has it all if i could give one emmy for fantastic photography and perfect solid director management this work is my nominee from the truth about the ever on goings of religious fundimentalists love and the wonder and joy of sex the speed bumps of relationships the need for income resources and of course to the reality of politics if you can t find yourself in at least three of the life events of the citizens of venice you may not have had a very interesting life this film story is both part of me and my passion for quality in the same way that waking ned devine raised my spirits and let my mind float on gratitude yes dangerous beauty on an aboslute nothing higher than is and always will be my 
the epitome of a great film walkabout is a film directed by nicolas roeg the man who fell to earth and is frequently considered one of the greatest films ever made having just finished my first and definitely not last viewing of it i must agree the film is an incredibly unique visual poem that is truly a beautiful sight to behold the film begins with this in australia when an aboriginie man child reaches sixteen he is sent out into the land for months he must live from it sleep on it eat of its fruit and flesh stay alive even if it means killing his fellow creatures the aboriginies call it the walkabout this is the story of a walkabout the story goes like this a man drives his two children into the harsh australian outback he has a teenage daughter and a much younger son none of the characters are given names the credits reveal them asgirl and white boy the girl is played by jenny agutter the son by lucien john the children are under the impression that they are driving all the way out here for a picnic but soon their father begins inexplicably shooting at them after he misses them he pours gasoline on the car lights it on fire and shoots himself in the head the girl and the boy don t waste time crying or screaming at the sky why like people in a lesser film would do instead they try to find their way back home armed only with some cans of fruit and an am fm radio after a few days of walking through the outback completely out of any source of water they meet a young aboriginie boy david gumpilil who s doing his walkabout since the aboriginie and the two sibilings don t speak the same language there s definitely a language barrier they have to get past obviously they don t but they find their ways of communicating things like water and such for a movie that spends about minutes of it s minute running time in the desert with little to no dialogue none of it really furthers the plot any this is truly a one ofakind work of art i know some reviewers including roger ebert who s responsible for me even hearing of this film reveal the fate of the aboriginie boy i m not going too it s much more effective if i don t in most of my reviews of movies that are deemed important films i usually grade the film on it s importance and it s entertainment value this is definitely an important film one that people definitely need to watch as for entertainment i can t answer that this film transcends that word you can t call it entertaining it really doesn t have the qualities of an entertaining film but it s not dull or boring either on another note many people talk about how the film is suitable for both adults and kids despite the fact that it contains both full frontal nudity of both genders and violence i think some of the most conservative parents in the world wouldn t mind letting their kids watch this both the nudity and violenced is handled in such a humane and realistic way it s really handled just as a thing of life i don t want this review to be too long so i m going to try and wrap it up real quick this is a beautiful haunting extremely well written and well acted film it s not just a film that movie buffs will enjoy but people who rush out to see resident evil could potentially like this film seriously do not miss this movie grade 
fever pitch this movie is pretty good if you like british films which i do colin firth does a great job at playing the crazed arsenal football fan and i have a feeling that if you also live and die for arsenal you ll like the film even more than i did the only downside to the movie is that it does drag at parts but overall it s witty and funny 
scooby doo is awesome it was fun to watch the first episode of scooby doo high rise hair raiser on my computer as a download with my kids we go back and watch it from time to time i am glad that amazon gave me this free download so that i could try this feature 
great episode this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see 
at last at last this amazing movie will be available on dvd i thought it wasn t going to happen and i had almost worn out my vhs copy so i bought a second vhs because i couldn t bear to think of life without shirley oh how we d all love to be the girl who used to be us and shirley after many years picks up her courage and does just that pauline collins deserved an oscar for her portrayal but hollywood doesn t work that way so she was pushed aside practically no one had heard of the movie so i rented it and it has been my favorite ever since i recommended it to all my friends who had just passed the year mark and they all loved it as much as i did and who wouldn t fall for tom conti the mischievous greek who helps shirley find out who she still is many years have passed but i still dream of sitting by the sea watching the sunset drinking wine in a land where the grapes are grown 
she s old so old she creaks and pops an average mst k hillarious in some parts a little dull in others but the good parts are worth the stars alone the main focus of joke making in this episode is the music and the horrible british accents a great episode for mst k fans but if you re new to the show start with a better episode 
really good worth the money but dont think it is a feel good happy movieits about life 
please put on dvd girl happy is the best and personally my favorite elvis movie around its highly recommended and a must see ! alsodvd distributors should take notice to release this wonderful movie on dvd at a more reasonable price so that humble people such as myself can afford it ! soplease put on dvd 
state and main the old water mill or without title this gem of a movie was probably not a blockbuster when released the storyline is thin and almost non existent it could be summed up as everyone gets the chance to screw up a second time nevertheless there are enough twists and turns to make what story there is interesting this must be the sort of movie that every good actor and actress would love to have a role in as the screenplay has been written by an accomplished playwright it is a farcical melodrama rather than a comedy but nonetheless highly enjoyable a film making team hard up on critical funds has just been thrown out of a small town in new hampshire their movie s plot necessitates the choice of a small town new england locale and a water mill one reason why they are short of funds is that they had to build an old water mill replica in the new hampshire town as the movie begins the director and his crew find themselves in a small town in vermont actually most of the scenes are shot in connecticut or massachusetts the beauty of the location is well captured by excellent photography the makers of state and main did not fall into the trap of shooting the film during the fall new england fall colours would be a major distraction although alfred hitchcock s black comedy the trouble with harry succeeded despite being shot in vermont at the peak of the fall leaf colour season but then hitchcock was an exceptional genius the small town has being going on in its leisurely way until the film crew arrive the obvious star of state and main is philip seymour hoffman a previously little known hollywood actor whose first appeared on the screen as the spoilt rich daddy supported george willis jr in that memorable al pacino film scent of a woman hoffman s key role in state and main is as the author and screen play writer for the movie within the movie the better known hollywood star alec baldwin plays the lesser role of the film in making s male star he is portrayed as a lustful male whose sexual preference is of under age nubile girls the director is played by william h macy who is completely unflappable no matter what the producer arrives after the crew has settled in the role is played by droopy eyed david paymer who is completely obsessed with money and will bribe anyone to get things moving the male star lead is almost fatally distracted by a young teenager julia stiles the female lead and siren sarah jessica parker demands substantial extra money for appearing naked in a scene claiming that she has found religion hoffman is smitten in the heart by an attractive young woman rebecca pidgeon in the town who is engaged or semi engaged to the local bad man and town councillor i will leave it to the reader s imagination to find out if the film crew gets the second chance to screw up again the movie is directed by david mamet a leading american playwright mamet wrote the screen plays for the postman always rings twice the untouchables and had a minor role as a performer in the thriller black widow he has directed several movies aside from this one in the past years it is evident that mamet who also wrote the screen play for this charming melodrama was at a loss for a suitable title for the film just like the director in the play who wanted to call his movie the old mill only to find out upon arrival in the vermont town that the much advertised old mill had burnt down in so mamet settled on the uninspiring title state and main from the intersection where the town s brand new traffic lights still stand at the start of the movie interestingly enough the title for the dvd version of state and main circulating in greece is translated as without title i am fairly confident that this little known minute movie will become a movie buff s classic one day 
the phantom of the opera is there inside my mind i like a lot the phantom of the opera what a fun grand movie it s got all the right components to entertain to take you into the different dimensions for minutes of its duration sweet innocence with an angel voice mysterious creature of the dark genius and madman prince charming who in this case is just a viscount but who cares the film itself is spectacular gorgeous sparkling with the colors so powerful images so magic and real and melodies so familiari don t know if it was the new cinema born in front of me or just a return to old good times when cinema was supposed to entertain to take you to the dream worlds someone said once that new is well forgotten old whatever it was the phantom of the opera directed by joel schumacher the way how it moves how it looks and how it plays is perfection itself and who cares that the story is silly and naive certainly not me 
white christmas dvd this is a wonderful story too bad writers can t create this type of heart warming story excellent cast and well written script 
wag the dog dustin hoffman presents a master role in the game of creating scenarios so realistic that the entire world becomes his work area so thorough is his work that the fiction becomes the reality and one cannot but watch the satire becomes the real life and the studio director becomes the world director a condition that cannot be tolerated and leads to his end are we living in that world can we now define reality who controls our thoughts this gives room to deep thoughts dustin hoffman is indeed the best person to portray this message 
a documentary snapshot of russian military life some may be looking for deep symbolism in days one reviewer called it surreal it is very realistic actually almost a documentaryabout a real problem in soviet and russian society low morale and brutal treatment of recruits in anarmy dogged by a failed war in afghanistan and thecollapse of the soviet union to this day today srussian military has faced accusations of atrocitiescommitted in grozny chechnya which had beentragic for both russians and chechens there have been red army scandals involving thedeaths of young men at the hands of criminallysadistic officers and ncos drug abuse alcoholand even male prostitution have been known to occuron army bases in one incident commanding officers got recruitsto perform sexual services for a third party whilethe officers took payment there have been rapesand desertion and suicide is not any surprisingevent just to escape the stultifying army environment recruits had been known to get high off theirboot polish many have gone blind from suchdangerous activity viewers of days who attempt to make sense ofall the nudity and strange broken down landscapeshouldn t trouble themselves too much such placesand activities literally did exist and were not suchuncommon sites around the boys rubbing eachother down nude is not justsome bizarre symbolism men of all ages did andstill do rub eachother down in the age old russiantradition of the banya or communal bath and sauna to some westerners it may look gay but it reallyis a traditional russian cultural phenomenon the broken down abandoned looking landscape wasnot a surreal movie set designed for effect sovietarmy bases were horribly dilapidated as much of sovietsociety was at the point of collapse the translations are indeed peculiar as one review pointsout the original russian title sto dnej do prikaza shouldactually be translated as a hundred days til orders arrive ie orders to get discharged or move on to anotherplace the producers maybe should have prefaced the film with somebackground on soviet russian society and culture back in so the realistic episodes of the film would not seem meaninglessand surreal 
fine film i bought this dvd the case for conspiracy by robert groden and it really is good you owe it to yourself to take a look at this dvd and it only costs or dollars this video made back in has all the known videos on the jfk murder and analyzes them in more detail than i have seen notable are shocking evidence tampering by the warren commision the autopsy photos were outrageously altered all doctors verify on video that the photos of the back of jfk s head is absolutely not the way they remember and that the photos produced by the warren commision or perhaps the us military autopsy where clearly some evil corruption took place are completely fraudulent an image of a person in the top left most window of the school book depository which is all one room evidence that if oswald was there he would have had to have known about this other person but this image i think adds to my doubt about oswald even being involved i am basically going on the included people s statement frankly meaning that frank fiorini and lee oswald were the main shooters but perhaps oswald was involved but there were others with him clearly jfk was hit in the back so somebody was there a simple fact that i had never heard or thought about until seeing this video that if oswald was on jfk s right how could a wound on jfk s head exit on the front right side video of the so called dogman behind the fence moving from nix s film video of the grassy knoll person from zupruter s film i never knew that zupruter actually filmed part of fiorini s or hunt or arnold s head plus ofcourse the famous colorized mary mormon photo of the stooges arnold fiorini and hunt behind the pick fence a very good dvd and groden appears to be an smart forthright and honest person 
this robin hood is unforgetable for years i ve enjoyed watching this movie i recently joined the disney movie club and picked this movie up for my year old son to watch and of course he loved it and as i watched him watching it it reminded me of the first time i watched it this movie was was made in the early s when disney wasn t turning out a lot of animated movie besides this movie and the rescuers disney didn t have a lot going on in the animation department but they put out some great live action films the cast for this movie is exceptional especially phil harris who puts the voice to little john if his voice sounds familiar it s because harris also voiced baloo in the jungle book and thomas o malley in the aristocats some would critisize disney by using harris again they would say little john and baloo are essentially the same character and my response it so what baloo is a great character and little john just makes harris look that much better the story is flowing and funny my favorite part of the film has to be the music it so great and contagious that i can t help but sing the songs hours after the movie is over so pick this one up and enjoy this disney classic with the whole family my one regret is that it doesn t have a special edition version maybe disney will do that soon 
possible comedy i believe this is easily in the top comedies of all time the lines are classic and farley is hilarious this is the kind of dvd i could watch over and over farley s lines vocal tones facial expressions body language dancing and delivery just can t be copied ! one of a kind ! too bad he is no longer alive 
a tale of media on the lines of wag the dog but nowhere near as powerfully satiric dark is minutes the basic undercurrent of the movie is the theme of media its influence on people and the kind of perceptions distortions that it can create somewhere at least in the screenplay there is a bit of lampooning of the usofa not just the way the media controls people but also in the aspect of the legal systems the double jeopardy law the unable to stand trial on grounds of insanity and stuff having said that the movie does provide a sharp look into media its effects in one dimension in the backdrop of this scenario comes yet another strong performance by de niro burns the characters are well fleshed out and played quite well by their cast the liberal smattering of czech russian influences gives the movie an interesting twist and therein is threaded the plot two guys coming to the us as tourists and trying to make it rich quick by beating the system there are elements of the movie which are cliched trite which tend to take away from a serious theme but in the interest of masala viewability i guess these foibles can be passed over and the movie enjoyed well minutes definitely worth a watch slightly violent though 
family dissolution lust for power madness the story line is superb the scenery is stunning and gorgeous vast mountains and green valleys walled castles and fortresses hidetora the aging warlord holds a conference with his three sons and local chieftains on a mountainside he announces his decision to relinquish the leadership of his kingdom to the eldest of his three sons only one son the youngest dares to speak up and state that during his lifetime he has known only war and fighting he predicts the same after the transfer of power he believes there will be power struggles between his two older brothers due to jealousy the youngest brother personally has no desire to be warlord hidetora planned to leave one castle to each of his three sons he has each son hold an arrow and asks them to break it in half which they easily do he gives them in succession three arrows bundled together representing the unity of the family none can break the bundle this is hidetora s example of how the family will remain strong if they remain unified he envisions the house of ichimanji to be powerful and his eldest son to be overlord of the kingdoms attained during hidetora s own reign of power in his anger hidetora banishes the youngest son accusing him of defying his wishes yet subarua the youngest holds his father in esteem and respect throughout the predicted battles which come to pass hidetora visits taro s castle after the power transfer and finds his concubines have to bow and kneel to taro s wife sue they are forced to move out hidetora discovers after the transfer of power he is no longer respected sue married into the family to consolidate land holdings and property attained as the spoils of war a war in which her parents were murdered she harbored revenge in her heart ever since and now urges her husband to fight his brother jiro hidetora s court jester creates a mocking song about taro being like a gourd spinning this way and spinning that way implying he can not make a sound decision and stick with it at a family gathering taro hears the song and is outraged in a surprise move hidetora and his guards leave to visit jiro hidetora discovers he is not welcome there either not at all what he expected he left abruptly the treachery to gain power and control over the lands and castles by the two older brothers consumes them as predicted by subaru the younger brother war is inevitable local chieftains must decide where their loyalties lie which brother to support hidetora goes into hiding eventually he goes mad his only guard and caregiver the jester does not leave his side this film contains very strong battle scenes the desire for control and power is the true motivator for both older brothers loosely based on shakespeare s king lear this japanese version is astonishing in scope and grandeur the costumes and scenery are fabulous in the film there are tender moments between the jester and hidetora there are moving scenes where jiro s wife escapes to find her brother who was blinded in a past conquest and lives alone in a cottage the producers and directors create a phenomenal ending and conclusion at some point hidetora reawakens from his madness long enough to recognize the impact of his decision on his family and the near destruction of the kingdom he once ruled the ending is climactic and leaves a major impression on the viewer the film is amazing erika borsos erikab

pretty darn good for a sequal hey for the third installment of the pink panther franchise it s not that bad the acting was excellent as ususal the plot is a simple one the famous pink panther diamond is stolen once again and all clues are pointing to that rouge jewel thief the phantom clouseau is brought in to solve the case but there is one problem this time the phantom aka sir charles lytton really didn t do it this time so now both closeau and lytton must race to figure out this mystery before they are both killed 
the day the earth stood still this is the original classic movie that everyone should see the props and the technology of film making has advanced but the differences in our world are the same man only does one thing well he finds improved ways of killing each other in this movie though many years old man is faced with a dilemma live in harmony or be eliminated by higher intelligence let s face it folks no intelligent life form would want to have anything to do with a race of people that only excell at murdering each other and their own environment ! it is a great movie

even if you re not a fan of westerns you may want to give this one a go i m amazed to realize that it s years old i think this film is going to end up among the classics when it gets a little older i m not a big western watcher at all but i end up watching this one when it s televised because the cinematography is marvelous it s what i loved when it first came out im revealing my age that and william goldman s screenplay for those reasons even if you don t care for shoot emups it s worthwhile 
a true classic i remember overhearing a conversation that included my father and other men around his age talking about the movies they loved as young people all of them agreed that one film was perhaps the greatest film of their youth captains courageous i think it s easy to see why this is the case the story may be old fashioned and this one time classic is hardly read anymore but the story of young harvey cheyne coming of age aboard a gloucester fishing schooner has a way at tugging at the heart and if given the chance people can change on of the reasons the film works so well is the acting depression era child star freddie bartholomew plays the incorrigible harvey bartholomew plays the role with great skill he s miserable enough that we re glad when he finally falls overboard yet sympathetic enough that we are glad he does get rescued the transformation is believable and by the films end we begin to believe in harvey and even grow to like him spencer tracy won an oscar as manuel the portuguese fisherman who in some ways becomes the only true father figure harvey has ever known today tracy would never get away with playing a portuguese fisherman with his irish looks and somewhat clumsy attempt at an accent yet his skill in portraying his character is undisputed lionel barrymore is perfectly cast as the old salt new england sea captain disko troop mickey rooney is somewhat underused as the captain s son dan my guess is that if the film were made a few years later when rooney became a matinee idol he would not be cast in such a small role or the role would be expanded while a great cast carries the film there are also smaller details that make the film powerful the original sea shanties add a certain flavor the special effects of the sea are magnificent for their time and the sailing scenes are stupendous this was no small feat in the s the film certainly is a timeless classic people who purchase this dvd will also love the bonus features trailers of the re release a short film the little maestro and a cartoon little bick cheeser 
clark and kerr clark gable zoomed back to the pre eminent place he long held in hollywood with this smash performance of vic norman the attractive huckster a radio advertising go getter he takes with him the lovely english deborah kerr who made her american film debut in this film from nearly everyone read the book by frederic wakeman back in the forties it was very popular the gable kerr team is ideal kerr made an impressive bow on the u s screen and the critics took notice sydney greenstreet is great as evan llewellyn evans who thinks america as a blank space between new york and hollywood where people buy soap ! producer arthur hornblow jr garnered top technical talent for this film and jack conway s direction is first rate ava gardner is mesmerizingly beautiful as the nightclub singer jean ogilvie at the end of the excellent luther davis screenplay gable gives out with the kind of denunciation of his brow beating boss that has been standard cinematurgy for years the script ribs everything in radio of yore from soap operas to forest lawn commercials 
darkest comedy the cast the pacing the violence the one liners this movie kills if you don t like it you re a prude or have no sense of humor this movie kills understand

how too funny i loved this movie i have a son currently serving our country in afghanistan and i guess it just brought some fun into a very unfunny experience it helped me to see boot camp in its true picture at least from a mother s standpoint it was good to see some humor in a very staunch experience not for children though ! 
one of the best this episode is a classic and is one of the best in the series it explores time travel and alternate time lines and it s storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed 
a textbook example of reactive attachment disorder watch this movie if you want insight into how childhood sexual abuse neglect and trauma horribly affects children s emotional development and ability to authentically attach to new caregivers if you re a foster parent adoptive parent teacher or therapist of a child with reactive attachment disorder this movie lays out all the triangulation manipulatiion and craziness that comes into play though the abusive caretakers are dead they continue to haunt the children and the children channel or are possessed by them this is symbolic for how abused children continue to recreate the chaos and abuse they experienced from their birth parents for years and years after removal i could go into greater detail but this movie would certainly make an excellent subject of study and analysis for a graduate course in psychology or social work 
outstanding this was a wonderful movie when i was younger and first saw it ! i am so glad to have watched it again and still feel the same

epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
what makes a classic a classic what makes this movie a kung fu classic quite simply the influence that it had on the genre and all the movies that followed it watch any modern kung fu movie from crouching tiger to the myriad of jet li films and you will see a little bit of deadly venoms in it this movie was as much a trend setter as enter the dragon of course today s movies are a lot more sophisticated in the acting sound and choreography but considert that this movie was made in the late s and still stands the test of time 
all about eve received the movie within a few days and the quality is excellent 
good disaster movie what i thought would be a another b movie turned out to be a good action flick good actors annabella sciorra michael biehn and quite a few other good tv actors worth the money and time to see it characters were developed and you knew who they were and what purpose they served good plot even kept the interest of my grandchildren can t find too many directors or producers that can make an interesting plot and keep it moving dr lily mckee played by annabelle sciorra discovers a massive asteriod hurtling towards the earth and tries to get feds to help and believe her she notifies fema in comes jack wallach michael biehn he plays his role well better than annablle sciorra sometimes she looks like she is confused but carries her role well good flick i think you ll enjoy good special effects

cubic cubist cuban who knows in this cubicle vincenzo natali is the worthy descendant of cronenberg he invents a model of our psyche in which we are everyone of us locked up in a cube that is the universe of our consciousness we are thus psychotic since the outside world does not exist and yet the master of this world has set six windows one on each side all around us we can open them one at a time and get out into another cube that has to be the psyche of someone else but this trip is very dangerous there might be a trap in that other cube a trap set by the other or by the supermaster of the universe we may be killed and die instantly hence we enjoy and find a sweet and soft refuge in our own psychosis but sooner or later someone will come into our cube or we will get into another cube where we will find someone else the drama of meeting with others will start as a competition to find a way out if there is one but we will discover very fast that all the cubes of all the individuals of the world are all connected within an even bigger cube but that the various cubes are constantly moving and yet there is a way out and we must find it we are little by little becoming schizophrenic and the elimination of the others becomes the objective that erases the possible escape from this world that we may have caressed for a while terminate the others and fast please to escape this world we need two qualities first to be able to mentally and spiritually feel sense and grasp the wider scope and scheme that is behind this cube these cubes and we then can see the red thread that is going to lead us to the exit and we need to be attached to absolutely no one or even to get rid of all those who could become attached to you or to whom you may get attached these two qualities are autistic characteristics but it is generally considered in our society as a disease if not some retardation thence we shrink in front of the others and we go back to our cocoonic psychosis that is more comfortable than this schizophrenia who controls this world is it god but then what about divine love is it the most pathetic human invention ever put forward not to speak of a pure folly that we have spread among human animals like a retrovirus that turned these animals into self declared human beings please wait for the end and step out of this cubic film to recapture some sanity dr jacques coulardeau university of paris dauphine university of paris i pantheon sorbonne 
despite the inclusion of tom green it was pretty damn funny this movie was recommended by my good friend bobby asslong in most cases his recommendations are a bunch of but he hit it right on with this one ! i detest tom green he is one of those guys who that when he fails at something talk show most of his movies life i actually feel happy and this is actually contrary to my normal personality i normally automatically love all canadians just kidding i normally want people to succeed and feel bad when they fail but tom green is so annoying great news ! he is in only about or scenes in this whole movie so you should be able to get through this movie with little to none hatred for mr green i love all the characters in this movie especially the main protagonist who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college he is very likeable and you re pulling for him the whole time another thing i like this movie is that it pulls a lot from other gross out teen and college flicks but it doesn t go overboard in the gross out department tom green plays the voice over explainer in the movie and he actually does a pretty good job without appearing stupid i give this high reviews mc white said check it out !

docu underdogs it s a testament to how powerful this movie is that i didn t care in the slightest about the subject matter and yet still was very emotionally affected by the trials and errors of these two kids i ve always viewed sports as that thing that i do to have fun and i stopped playing once people started taking it so seriously that it became too competitive to be fun but seeing these two boys drive themselves through troubles with funds injuries and scholastics in order to pursue their one dream is very inspiring it s yet another work that makes your typical normal middle class life seem banal in light of the accomplishments and struggles of the underdogs basically it s like watching all of those millions of underdog sports movies except this one has the added tension of being real these kids can fail at any moment and sometimes a last second basket gets missed in a way it displaces all of an entire genre of sports movies and makes it only necessary to watch this one one that is real has real characters has real dialog and has real risk polarisdi 
stars remastered little mermaid is spectacular five stars my wife and i just watched this disney movie with our year old son the colors are exquisite deeply saturated clear crisp detail and picture quality is incredible sound quality was substantially better than the original all channels of sound were strong without being harsh and convey a sense of beauty the film is all about the triumph of human spririt i m sure that the girls will relate to the princess but my son was impressed as well thanks disney for doing such a great job in remastering this classic i will keep it in my library for the princesses in my family 
compulsively watchable if you have the stomach for it this movie is chockfull among my favorites parts are a very visual description of sepsis and a painting on the wall of an iraqi bunker featuring a portrait of saddam in cap and gown when i say it s chockfull i mean it s coming out of the goddamn walls lots of details most of the time it s just flat out top notch filmmaking smart and brand new in a way seldom seen and while it s balls out style is the best thing about the movie it s also it s main problem a little too overdone as an example the set up for the scene of ice cube tossing his c nerf football was done so overtly david o russel might as well have told us the scene number but in the end the film s message never desert your friends no matter what nationality however heavy handedly it may be have been delivered is still a potent one and watching it now with all of its references to the first iraq war the first george bush brings that message and all its attendant moral confusion into harsh focus 
a must have if your into gangster or mafia movies this collection is a must i purchased this item as a gift to my fiancee and he was thrilled with it i mean with stars like marlon brando robert deniro al pacino and countless more how can you go wrong this is definitely a collectors item that you want to include in your movie library the packaging is awesome with the stars and directors image on the front and the delivery time was as promised no complaints here 
spy kids the kids really loved this we liked it too exciting nice to choose d version or standard version 
quite possibly the most emotionally profound film ever made i won t go into plot sypnosis as it s been detailed in previous reviews of the film instead i d like to address the message and meaning of the film in order to fully appreciate au hasard balthazar one must understand the thematic construction of the film by being literally a passive dumb beast who is being passed from owner to owner and being mistreated and shown little love throughout his life bresson uses balthazar as a witness and reflection or both a window and mirror if you will of human nature in all its facets there are also the clear parallels bresson establishes between balthazar and his owners especially his first owner marie the purpose of such a thematical tool is for the audience to regard balthazar as another facet of the human condition but only in the spiritual sense bresson takes extreme care in not anthromorphologize the donkey so with balthazar and these group of characters the film shows the entire spectrum of humanity purity balthazar good jacques evil grard weakness arnold selfishness merchant arrogance maries father and self pity marie in one or several of these characters we can see ourselves since they encapsulate the different ways human beings deal with their existence now this is the most important thing to comprehend about the film balthazar is an ignorant unknowing beast who has no choice but to accept everything that happens to him in his life due to his condition that of being a donkey a creature who has no intelligence and who has no free will he simply lives life the way he knows he is used as an animal of burden and he does so he is mistreated by his owners he accepts the mistreatment he is shown love and compassion by marie he accepts it he even shares his state of being with other animals in times of captivity during his stay in the circus and times of freedom during in his deathbed if you think about it within the oportunities or lack thereof he has been given and the circumstances good and bad he s gone through balthazar has achieved to live life to the fullest and die with utmost grace us human beings have a different condition to balthazar human beings have intelligence reasoning and have the free will to make choices yet with all those gifts and advantages humans have no peace of mind and keep having an attitude towards life and making choices that more often than not lead to a life of misery and suffering destroying ourselves and the lives of others in the process the simple yet profound question the film basically begs us to ask to ourselves is if balthazar could live life to the fullest why can t we when we realize this reflection on balthazar s life and reflect it on our own a sudden feeling of enlightenment trascendence and spirituality undeniably invades us throughout this meaningful revelation we emerge with a moral clarity especially concerning the characters in the film and with a newfound sense of spirituality hope and a strong will to transform ourselves i personally can t think of something more inspiring and life affirming than that au hasard balthazar very well might change your life this is one of the most noble humane and beautiful works of art of any medium 
another wayne ford compilation many people know about john wayne and john ford s cavalry trilogy three of the greatest westerns ever made but another pairing between the two is not as well known the three godfathers is a lesser known john wayne classic when he was at the top of his game starring harry carey jr and pedro armendariz as the other two godfathers this classic should not be missed these three outlaws ride into the desert after a bungled robbery only to find a dying woman with a newborn infant the duke promises to care for the baby which she names robert william pedro hightower after the three outlaws they must then make the trek across the desert with very little supplies to get the baby to the next town excellent supporting cast with many recognizable faces from other duke movies with ward bond playing the sheriff who attempts to track down the outlaws truly funny scenes as wayne armendariz and carey attempt to care for the baby as usual awesome scenery as is expected in john ford westerns this is one classic that has to be put on dvd a must have for john wayne fans 
i don t know i love this stand up i saw this for the very first time about or yrs ago and i still laugh as hard as i did the first time i watched it i m a big fan of chris rock and all those guys but cosby figures out a way to be hilarious while still being clean for everyone to watch if you wanna see great comedy you should really check this one out 
halloween fans love them all sure it is no where near being as good as the original but as a fan of the halloween s i love them all including this somewhat cheesy attempt to keep the story going if you are going to believe that a man can be shot and blown up and all that other stuff and can still live on then you cannot complain about this flick plus it has great comedic one liners that will make you laugh my opinion is that is still better than half the crap they make nowadays 
excellent audio commentary by stephen prince i knew that akira kurosawa s kagemusha had some basis in history but i didn t know how much until i listened to this dvd s audio commentary by film scholar stephen prince the warrior s camera the cinema of akira kurosawa according to prince virtually the entirety of the film s story is based on historical events the major exception being the character of the thief who acts as the double of shingen the warlord however shingen a historical figure had employed doubles in real life so kurosawa s fictionalizing of the title character isn t that much of an embellishment what makes prince s commentary so outstanding is his in depth knowledge of japanese history the historical events chronicled in the film are well known to a japanese audience but they re unfamiliar to the average western viewer so kurosawa s often unconventional depiction of these events are frequently lost on non japanese audiences for example according to prince the wounding by gunfire of shingen as he listens to an enemy s flute marks a monumental event in japanese history but kurosawa portrays the event only in an oblique manner by having the sniper who shot shingen re enact the shooting for ieyasu tokugawa another historical figure and the eventual winner of the wars that kurosawa depicts just imagine a film about abraham lincoln that dramatizes his assassination by having it re created by secret service agents and you ll get an idea of kurosawa s inventiveness prince discusses some off screen historical events that were going on the same time as the incidents in the film giving the listener a much broader understanding of both history and kurosawa s accomplishment also prince talks in depth about some of the artistic license that kurosawa has taken with non fictional events after listening to the commentary i came away with a much deeper appreciation for kagemusha since so much has already been said about the film itself i will only add this it s unfortunate that shintar katsu who was originally cast in the title role and is best known for starring in the zatoichi film series was fired by kurosawa before filming began in earnest tatsuya nakadai who replaced katsu is a superb actor but his screen presence doesn t have the comic warmth that katsu could have brought to the role and that i think would have enhanced the film and at the risk of infuriating nakadai fans everywhere i would also prefer to have seen his lead role in kurosawa s ran played by toshir mifune i can t watch kagemusha without wondering how the film might have looked if kurosawa and katsu hadn t quarreled otherwise kagemusha is among kurosawa s best period films even if you already own kagemusha on tape this criterion dvd might be worth renting for prince s commentary alone disclaimer i do not know stephen prince personally nor do i have any vested interest in his work 
great for year olds my three year old loved being able to see the characters from peter and the wolf it really solidified the story for him i highly recommend it 
a good movie i enjoyed running on empty really because of river phoenix he is such an incredible actor and he really shows his acting skills in this movie i also liked martha plimpton in this movie she was very good 
completely mind blowing i am currently a medical student hoping to have a future career working specifically with hiv aids patients when i ordered this movie i was expecting any typical drama movie that is not well dramatized when i received the movie i watched it before taking it to class the next day and i was just shocked at how informed i was of the disease it is so incredible ! i took the movie to school the next day and everyone that has not seen the movie had the same reaction that i had even the teacher had watched it before and was still moved by it if you are unsure of buying it i can tell you that it is a movie to own if you are into true life dramas everytime that i watch it i am still floored by how our world had changed by this epidemic ! 
in the true spirit of len deighton thoroughly enjoyable caine is the aged palmer in the spirit of len deighton s working class spy cliche yes ! but who would want otherwise 
better than th street i love this movie every year there is a hour marathon on the television of this film and my family and i watch it at least ten times it truly never gets old with us as the characters are authentic and full of good humor it is hysterically funny at times especially when the father receives the leg lamp in the mail and pronounces the word stamped on the box fragile as frageelay huh must be italian ralphie and his family make my family s holiday a lot brighter and we all look forward to watching this movie every year 
woody s best except maybe the earlier funny ones i have watched this movie probably times and each time i watch it i love it more i think this is woody at his best with a great cast and an amazing performance by nick apollo forte except for his earlier funny films which are in a class by themselves this film has the perfect balance of comedy drama dry wit suspense larger thanlife characters reminds me of raging bull but that s a whole nuther genre as much as i love annie hall sometimes it seems dated and hard to watch but bdr is timeless do like i did if you can t decide whether to put down the cash right off the bat rent it watch it and buy it i know you will bravo woody ! now what happened to the rest of your films 
a must see classic movie this movie is great in several ways all audrey hepburn fans would love it she shows that her talent is more than just a beautiful face it is also a front runner because it shows the artistry of a great filmmaker who can build suspense and tension merely with the use of light of staging without resorting to the cheap tricks of excessive violence the film s use of light and shadow is amazing the timing of the characters exits and entrances is like watching a finely tuned play this was a play actually this one will have you on the edge of your chair the famous ending scene will take your breath away every time even if you ve seen it before ! when suzy s husband finally gets home and realizes what has happened his reaction is lame they should have rewritten that one but that is only minutes so don t let that keep you from watching this one rent this movie for your teens who like suspense thrillers they will enjoy it 
an eclectic evocative and wholly outstanding collection composed by renowned south indian recording artist l subramaniam the quotsalaam bombay quot soundtrack features an invigorating blend of jazz and traditional indian styles that serves to emotively embellish the movie s heart wrenching tale in fusing east with west in the plaintive and the frenetic the work also manages to gloriously capture the spirit that defines the remarkable city that is bombay the album is not just distinguished though by its innovativeness or even its evocativeness but also by the sheer brilliance of the musicianship on display track number quotchillums theme quot this song does not appear in its entirety in the motion picture for instance remains what is in my opinion one of the most incredible pieces of music to have graced my ears

by preaching destabilization they encourage subversive ideas the film the official story wraps the politics of government supported torture and the slaughter of thousands of argentinians around the awakening of the social conscience of one woman alicia norma aleandro is a married affluent history teacher who works in a boys school in buenos aires she and her prominent husband roberto hector alterio have an adopted child gaby when alicia attends a reunion of school friends she s delighted to see ana chunchuna villafane a woman who abruptly left the country seven years earlier the atmosphere at the reunion becomes a bit tense when one woman breezily mentions that someone they all knew only has one child left when asked what happened to the other children the woman says they were all subversives while everyone else seems to find this a perfectly reasonable explanation alicia is troubled but there s more troubling information in store ana reveals to alicia that she left argentina after being horribly tortured by military government officials who were trying to extract information about a man she once knew ana was lucky to survive but she tells alicia that there were many who didn tincluding women who gave birth inside jail and had their babies stolen from them and given to the families of the privileged elite while alicia whos only been vaguely aware of past social unrest would like to reject the horrific information of her friend s treatment prompted by her conscience she begins to question if her adopted daughter is a child of the disappeared ones los desaparecidos alicias brutish husband whos outraged ana is back in argentina and frivolous friends believe that torture and disappearances only happen to those who deserve it in some fashion it takes exposure to the brutalities conducted by the state to shake alicia out of her nice sanitized perfect world as a teacher of history she believes by understanding history we understand the world but she fails to realize that history is all too often an official version she s never questioned authority or the official versions of the past and at the beginning of the film she s flabbergasted when a student argues that history is written by assassins slowly she begins to connect with those around her including a fellow teacher who explains that alicia didn t want to believe the horrific truth because to believe murders and tortures were really happening would be to acknowledge complicity the official story is a perfect film on every level it s incredible to realize that so many people just disappeared in argentina between and the film brings home the pain and the horror while making this a very human moving story directed by luis puenzo the official story is in spanish with english subtitles displacedhuma 
one of the greatest sci fi films of the past decade this movie equilibrium directed by kirt wimmer ultraviolet is one of the most overlooked and forgoten gems of cinema in almost a decade ! amagine a world without emotion there is no war no hate no envy or crime a perfect world there is also no human being that can emote feel love care or empathize with thier fellow man the cause of this a drug that soceity takes daily to keep thier emotions at bay this is the story of one man s awakening to emotion and love and about how he fights back against a system that keeps humanity under it s control by taking away what it truely means to be human the story is epic in its scope and scale the acting is beyond great the action in mind blowing and intense the star of this film is christian bale who would become the future of the batman movies in c nolan s batman begins

offscreen drama frances farmer was a s actress who starred in movies such as come and get it but she was known more for what happened in her real life than her movies a native of seattle frances was a non comformist she was outspoken independent politically active and unlike the many celebrities of her time and even ours pursued acting for the sake of acting she didn t pursue it for the money the fame or the recognition she did it because she loved it it was what she wanted to do and she wanted to be free to choose her own roles she was very much her own person the susan sarandon and jane fonda of her time however she was doing all of this in the s a time when being a rebel in hollywood was frowned upon in fact it was downright discouraged the studio executives didn t take too kindly to this and they made sure frances paid for it oh boy did she ever pay hollywood may not have directly contributed to her downfall but they surely played their part coupled with the troubles in her own life such as her drinking and brushes with the law not to mention a very troubled relationship with her mom a controlling exploitative woman who seemed to live vicariously through her daughter without caring what she was doing to her frances spent the better part of her adult life in various mental institutions where patients were mistreated and sexually exploited men would be snuck in after hours to have sex with them she was eventually given a transorbital lobotomy robbing her of all the traits that made her who she once was some have said that she never really got one and others have said that she did we ll never really know frances farmer really wasn t crazy sure she was no angel but she absolutely wasn t crazy she was a strong independent woman who was just herself and wanted to be true to that after all was said and done she was killed not physically but emotionally and mentally

what fun elf is one of our favorite family christmas movies we purchased this particular edition for the karaoke coloring pages games and activities that were offered i really didn t think my kids would be very interested in the games but to my surprise they loved them even now after christmas we find ourselves using lines from the movie maybe it s a little corny but it always brings a smile i recommend this edition to anyone who just can t get enough of buddy the elf

small scale indie has its charms and nicely etched performances i am hopeful that katie holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a stepford wife for her couch jumping husband tobe it s not that she strikes me as all that brilliant but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as april burns a rebellious twenty something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family s upstate home to a tenement in manhattan s lower east side encouraged by her new boyfriend bobby who happens to be black she invites her estranged family to thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment there is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst driven mother is dying of breast cancer and this may be their last meal togetherdirected and written by peter hedges who wrote the equally eccentric whats eating gilbert grape the story bounces back and forth between april s hazard ridden preparation of the meal and the burns family s chaotic journey to the city while the family trip will remind you somewhat of this year s little miss sunshine april s adventure consists mainly of meeting her motley neighbors all strangers at first to borrow a working stove for her turkey among others she runs into a friendly black couple an obsessive vegan and an elderly chinese couple whom she teaches the origins of the holiday on top of this is an odd racially driven storyline involving bobby s need to buy a suit while being pursued by some suspicious characters shot in digital video by tami reiker and running only eighty minutes the movie works toward an inevitable conclusion but hedges adds enough filmmaking idiosyncrasies to make it all seem more intriguing than it has any right to be among the supporting cast patricia clarkson stands out as april s mother joy bringing a steely resolve as she crumbles under the surface oliver platt is terrific as her put upon husband jim as are derek luke as bobby and allison pill as april s perfect little sister beth in little more than cameos which could have been excised sean hayes plays a neurotic neighbor with a new stove and a pampered dog while dru hill s sisqo plays bobby s friend latrell hedges provides a nice commentary track on the dvd which also includes a fifteen minute making of featurette 
a film noir classic i m glad to see that the sean penn version of this movie has sparked an interest in the academy award winning original there are the unmistakable marks of its time in this film it was made just after the end of ww ii and drawing analogies to dictatorships and american socialism are right from the times themselves broderick crawford is really good as willie although some members of the supporting cast especially john ireland are not up to the roles they play i also don t know whether the direction was as good as it could be there are some situations where the combination of writer director is absolutely inspired but i would not say that here the ultimate destruction of the old order is to me the most fascinating element of this film film noir was all about that a breakdown in an old social order with nothing but a void seeming to replace it that is much in evidence here exemplified as it was in the book by burdens landing and its complex blend of great principles lost but old prejudices and injustices going away too its a fascinating movie and still quite watchable today i agree with some who say there that it is better than the remake as good as the remake was 
an important story this film opens and closes with footage from a czech news program in talking about righteous gentile nicholas winton who saved children from the nazis in the late thirties and reuniting him with some of those very children he saved who are now old he would have saved even more than that had wwii not broken out in september of as he had had plenty of more names of children to be saved and transported to safety on his lists however to save these children mr winton had to convince their parents to do the unthinkable to say goodbye to them and send them away on a train alone to a strange new country england where they didn t speak the language didn t know anybody and would be taken into the homes of strange families they had never met one of those children was david silberstein whom we meet in this film his parents jakub and irma have a comfortable rather privileged life his father is a doctor after all and a big happy family david s other loved ones include his older sister hedvica who is always going to the movies to make out with her boyfriend later husband robert who works as a projectionist his uncle leo who is a cantor his uncle sam who is a successful violinist his uncle max who is somewhat of an itinerant wanderer rather like a gypsy and his best friend sosha klein his childhood sweetheart a rather cute little girl like most families in europe at the time the silbersteins too think that what s happening in nazi germany won t happen in a civilised place like czechoslovakia even after the germans invade their homeland and gradually start making life harder for them however since this film takes place entirely in the late thirties and is told through the eyes of a child we never see anything very bad happening things did not really start to get really bad in czechoslovakia for a few years more most czech jews were still living in their own houses even with increasing persecution and restrictions until the bad things that happen are things like the silbersteins car getting taken by nazis a little german boy throwing a knife into one of their trees over and over again and uncle sam s beautiful young gentile fiance alenka who is about half his age breaking the engagement because of pressure from her father and because as sam puts it her fear was stronger than her love the main focus of the film is the happy normal life this family enjoys just prior to the end of innocence making it a more subtle portrayal of these years than one normally expects from such films many films about these years seem to start with normal life but then move into more and more horror and sadness but not so here it also moves back and forth between the respective characters instead of putting all of the focus on the storyline of nicholas winton convincing irma and jakub to make the arrangements so david can be put on one of the trains going to safety in england before it s too late that storyline only really comes into focus towards the end of the film when uncle sam introduces his friend mr winton to his brother and sister inlaw urging them to save david even if they may be convinced nothing bad is going to happen to them and find it foolish to try to leave their homeland just because their people are being persecuted yet again though this film does move a bit slowly and may annoy some viewers by how it jumps back and forth between the different characters and their storylines instead of staying focused on one main plot this kind of cinematic approach can work very effectively at really drawing the viewer into the story unfolding making him or her truly care about these different characters and what happens to them i only wish that there have been some kind of epilogue even with just text on the screen telling us about the respective fates of david s loved ones even knowing that david was the sole survivor of his family it kind of leaves the viewer hanging wondering what exactly happened to them after the war began if they tried to leave or go into hiding how long they survived if robert and hedvica went through with it and tried to cross into slovakia just about the only safe border that was left to fulfill their dream of going to palestine and if their baby were a boy or a girl the film really ends just as the viewer is really getting involved in these people s lives my only other problem was how on the back of the dvd the blurb actually twice says the silberstein s when clearly it meant the silbersteins it s so embarrassing when errors like this make their way into print since it only encourages people who genuinely think that an apostrophe makes a word plural and other just asbasic grammatical errors that no one out of elementary school should still be making extras include a number of trailers photo galleries and filmographies for rupert graves nicholas winton and josef abrhm dr jakub silberstein 
great baseball story i have the second part of this movie major league part ii and knew that i had to get the first part to add to my dvd collection 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
love this movie many people would think i would be messed up in the head but i saw this movie black circle boys years ago i wanted to own it and they no longer carried it in the stores to rent like they did at one point i went on amazon and my boyfriend bought it for me when i found it i thought i was the only one to see it and i wasn t my boyfriend s friend saw it years ago eric mabius is so hott to me and so is kyle i enjoy watching it i don t believe in all that satan stuff and i think it cruel what they do but all in all i love it ! 
lange did deserve the award jessica lange plays a stressed out quotcrazyquot military housewife who moves with her husband tommy lee jones and kids from hawaii to alabama she gets involved with his boss who is working on a radiation project jones does not believe in lange has to go far to prove her love for jones and she does i read this movie sat on the shelf for three years becase its distributor orion went out of business excellant movie and beautiful music

j m for w m i love anything ravi zacharias writes he brings you to the only conclusion possible in whatever spiritual truth he is presenting and i love this but greater still there is in ravi zacharias a truth that transcends intellect he genuinely loves the lord he writes or speaks about this makes his books or his sermons worth my attention 
honest opinion of ryan s daughter superb video and audio quality on the dvd and simply a great movie ! 
what a shock michael caine gives a great performance in this movie as he was passed over for a promotion he plays by the rules only to get trampled by those less deserving of said promotion then he takes matters into his own hands and makes power moves that gets him his much deserved promotion by any means necessary 
a most beautiful film this is a visually lovely well acted heartwarming whimsical movie we all loved it my husband and i my teenage daughter and our six year old daughters there s a tinge of sadness as the little girl s mother is dead and her father doesn t take good care of her so she goes to live with her grandparents there isn t a lot of action it s a quiet movie not huge special effects or big action scenes it has a dreamy quality also the irish accents are such a pleasure to hear ! 
truly breathtaking in a nutshell this version of hamlet left me speachless branagh s interpretation is magnificent not to be missed ! i highly recommend ! 
refined but difficult rating and reviewing movies like these are often difficult for the average critic on one hand they re done absolutely brilliantly done in ways that take one s breath away on the other hand how much credit can you give to a movie that is pure propaganda especially propaganda for something the reviewer doesn t agree with this realistic re enactment of the events of october th is actually anything but realism instead it is a harrowing and amazing romantic experience this is not to say it s bad its brilliant ! the direction and editing on this film are much more refined than eisenstein s previous and much moreheralded film brenonsets potyemkin battleship potemkin and it has a whole lot more symbolism and focus on literary devices his fast paced cutting is not as disjunctive as previously instead it works to shock the viewer with the juxtapositions i don t think i shall ever get the quick back andforth cutting between that one soldier s face and the firing machine gun ever out of my mind it s just that powerful this movie is so good in fact that it makes me proud to be a bolshevik and i m not not in any way or form ! how s that for being a powerful well done movie the birth of a nation didn t effectively make me proud to be a klansman for a comparison because of its intense political alignment i can t see everyone appreciating this film there will always be those out there who say ah it s only communist propaganda which is right so it s not even worth watching which is wrong for those who are looking for a magnificent cinematic experience however this movie is a fine choice indeed polarisdi 
guest does it again best in show is another of the very funny improvisational dialog movies that christopher guest has directed the situations are scripted by christopher guest and eugene levy but after that they simply let the actors go where they will with the characters and keep the cameras running in this movie he takes aim at dog shows and the results speak for themselves the plot of this film is very simple as the audience is following dogs and their owners and trainers as the go to compete in the mayflower dog show michael mckean and john michael higgins are hilarious as stefan vanderhoof and scott donlan the gay owners of miss agnes a shih tzu and parker posey and michael hitchcock are equally funny as the preppy win at all cost owners meg and hamilton swan of beatrice a weimaraner christopher guest plays harlan pepper the outdoorsman owner of hubert a bloodhound catherine o hara and eugene levy are the mismatched couple cookie and gerry fleck who own winky a norwich terrier where gerry is a geek and cookie seems to have ex lovers all over the country last but not least we have jennifer coolidge who plays sheri ann ward cabot the rich owner of the two time reigning champion rhapsody in white a poodle and jane lynch who plays christy cummings the trainer the other key members of the cast are fred willard who plays buck laughlin the know nothing tv announcer and jim piddock who is trevor beckwith the knowledgeable color man and who plays the straight man for willard s antics there are also some wonderful smaller roles such as larry miler as one of cookie s ex lovers and ed begley jr as the hotel manager those are just some of the names but i can t do justice to their wonderful work in such a short review the actors are the key to improvisation and the audience is in good hands with this movie the situations are funny but the performances are even funnier best in show premiered at the toronto film festival on september th it was not nominated for any academy awards but it did win three american comedy awards including funniest motion picture funniest supporting actor in a motion picture fred willard funniest supporting actress in a motion picture catherine o hara and christopher guest was also nominated for funniest supporting actor in a motion picture the film was also nominated for and won awards from many different groups such as the american cinema editors boston society of film critics british comedy awards canadian comedy awards the golden globes and many more this dvd includes an audio commentary by christopher guest and eugene levy which is somewhat low key but there are some very funny moments if you pay close attention also available are quite a few deleted scenes you will also find the features which are almost standard at this point such as a trailer and cast filmmaker profiles in my opinion this is the best of the improvisational films after this is spinal tap 
i loved it i love this movie it is not in english but the story is easy to understand and has an ending you will always remember a great popcorn evening at home movie 
ageless adventure in exploring one s life if you go with it first viewed this something years ago what keeps me returning to it is what i saw as i kid that dared me to explore whats out there in the world it explores sex yes it was filmed at a time whwn people didn t worry about aids but more than this it has this urge to make you want to explore go into the unkonwn its ok yes i went to greece that was years ago i ve been discovering the world around me ever since if you have money or not it doesn t matter what matters is the confidence and possible humbleness we all have if we just detach ourselves and let ourselves have a moment s of clearity enjoy ! 
one of sandra s best films th april ben affleck is one of my best actors and so is sandra bullock i really enjoyed this film it was kind of funny on the aeroplane at the begginning of the film the plane goes all wonky due to a bird flying into the fan of the plane ben hits sandra on the head with a laptop and it is so funny it is quite unusual to other films and that was why i liked it really half romantic and brillllllll film 
very original greek mythology was something i ve never paid much attention to having said that i knew nothing about the legend of orpheus and eurydice it wasn t until i got this from the library after noticing it had won the palme d or at the cannes film festival and had won the oscar for best foreign film and read the little booklet included in the criterion release that i found out about the whole story needless to say i found the whole idea intriguing the filmmakers took this greek myth and transferred it to rio de janeiro in the middle of carnival and in doing so created a colorful and beautiful movie that s not to say black orpheus is a very entertaining film but the lush scenery and music make it a masterpiece the story is pretty simple eurydice has arrived in rio to stay with her cousin serafina eurydice is running from a masked man death and is in a frequent state of fear when she gets onto a streetcar she meets orpheus orpheus is a streetcar operator and a ladies man who has just become engaged to mira when they re getting a license the man jokes to mira let me guess you re eurydice orpheus is popular around his community for his musical talent it s said that when he plays his guitar and sings he makes the sun rise anyway the story is a greek tragedy so you can guess that the love between orpheus and eurydice doesn t quite go as planned the film s tragic ending is quickly lifted by a beautifully photographed scene this movie is technically a love story but the orpheus eurydice is merely the foundation of the story it s the music and art direction and cinematography that makes this so good the music especially plays a huge part in the film the look of the movie gets even better when you realize how long ago it was made look at the film some like it hot released the same year and then look at this film this movie will not entertain the masses for years to come but movie greek mythology buffs might want to check it out or just people who appreciate beauty in film entertainment bart direction amusic acinematography aoverall a 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
i can t help it i love this movie the s spawned one high school teen movie after another and john hughes was the king of that genre but somehow along the way among the breakfast clubs and the pretty in pinks three o clock high got overlooked it s quite rare when i actually meet someone who s heard of this comedy gem i had quite a lot of trouble even finding a copy of it on dvd and was going to purchase a copy here on amazon but finally found it at a buy selltrade store in hollywood so anyway while i am very happy to finally have this movie on dvd in widescreen for the first time instead of watching it on my vcr on a recorded scratchy tape i was a little dissapointed that there were no features whatsoever on this disc movie reccomendations don t count you can get plenty of those on amazon further proof that not enough people know or care about this movie furthermore casey siemaszko the star the heart and soul of this movie failed to develop as a lead actor since this movie never really got any recognition he had a lot of supporting roles in the late s such as young guns stand by me and back to the future which is a shame because he is too funny in this movie the movie has a good cast too even though the protagonist of the film who looks years too old to be in high school he s the perfect school bully not to mention this movie has the best school yard fight you ll ever see please check this one out john hughes isn t the only one who could make good s highschool movies and this is certainly one of the best ones 
bs tells it all i have watched most of the bs series and this is one that shows what is happening to many of our american organizations religious control 
upwardly mobile i m no longer in the target audience for this movie i realize that i checked out this dvd not as a lame attempt to convince myself that i m still young and hip i actually was interested because i heard it was the first american major motion picture to feature asian characters as the leads but not stereotypically not utilizing the asian ethnicity as a comic device not as comically impish cartoon characters not as martial artists or wise sages also i really like white castle burgers i wasn t disappointed the lead characters are two asian american men who have reasonably well developed three dimensional characters that was refreshing however i wouldn t say this movie is free of stereotypes the asian women in this movie are definitely in the mold of the church going hard working but ultra dorky asian and in fact all the women in this movie are stereotypes of one sort or another come to think of it even the asian men in this movie outside of the two leads are stereotypes i m thinking of the budding entrepreneur asking harold for a letter of recommendation and also of kumar s hard working doctor father forcing kumar into a series of fixed medical school interviews and the two jewish stoners and the white racist skateboard punks but okay little steps some of the humor in this movie really worked for me such as harold and kumar inexplicably happening upon a lion in new jersey and riding it to their next point of adventure some of the humor is vulgar gross out humor that didn t work for me i m not opposed to vulgarity and gross out humor when it is in the service of good comedy borat being the most obvious recent example or the blazing saddles campfire scene being a more classic example but here it felt like it was in lieu of comedy cheap laughs again though it probably worked in the theater on the intended audience of inebriated adolescent boys not great but i m glad i saw it an overall thumbs up i also appreciated some of touches on the dvd such as the backdrop of harold and kumar sitting in the car during the main menu which is not a still from the movie but a good twenty minutes of the two of them sitting there driving occasionally asking each other what is taking the viewer so long to make a selection once you realize it s not on a short loop you re obligated to sit and watch it and see how long it can go on 
another kids movie being underrated by the adults wow some people take children s movies too seriously i own harriet the spy and i still love it the same since it came out and i think it is a nick classic if you think about it its a shame the new generation of kids have to grow up without movies like this harriet the spy does have a few things in it that seem like its not for children but if you pay attention and watch it to the end it also teaches you to appreciate what you have and plenty of other good morals the movie description is a bit simple and complicated at the same time its about an yr old that wants to be a writer but her spying is her writing actually its more like shes exploring and writing everything she sees you cant just read reviews about the movie you have to see it cause some of the reviews dont do this great movie any justice the acting is great and the story line is very original and thought provoking if your a parent and you would like to know if this is a good movie for your kids well im tellin you it is i was when it came out and it has made me look at some things differently this is a great movie and you shouldn t let your kids miss this and this definitely will teach children to appreciate good friends and more important good parents i m sorry if this review doesn t help or give a good movie description but this is a very underrated movie that will leave a good impression on kids not a bad one 
kinda cute but the traveling plot seemed like a take off of trains planes and automobiles traveling from ny to savannah vs traveling from chicago to ny same sequence airplane delays then train occurrence then bus then jalopy type car but since i totally enjoyed the steve martin movie i also enjoyed forces of nature the writer even threw in some weather and fire same as trains planes and automobiles because of the similarities i rated it four stars instead of five i thought the movie was cute and i like both sandra bullock and ben affleck i saw the movie as being typical of infatuation with a good looking person to whom we ve been thrown together with for a brief unlikely encounter and of indecisiveness prior to the marrage ceremony but ben was indeed committed to his fiance and to his future which was a positive attribute on his behalf unlike some other reviewers who stated commitment was void i felt it was very much stated in this movie in spite of other s around them having their own relationships fall apart sarahs life was to be her son and her relationship with him to build it up after some years of absence the movie ended correctly everyone got what they wanted gail gupton author the day diet of spiritual enlightenment and seekers of truth 
excellent drama with suprise ending james woods was great as a burned out ill give this job one more try kind of character who risks his life to discover a deeply buried truth his client really is innocent and his career as an attorney is reborn too bad james woods doesn t get enough parts in hollywood but i suspect the bottom line is he is not part of the inner circle hes a reublican

classic story of good versus evil with a few new twists i remember reading tom tryon s book when it first came out it was frightful beyond anything else i had read at the time when the movie came out i couldn t wait to see it when i did finally see it i was both thrilled and disappointed translating a book with numerous rich characters and subplots to the screen is often a difficult task as was in this case but overall i think they did a great job watching this movie again years later i still feel the same because i can still remember how involved the book was i am not hoping for a remake of the movie that would probably prove a horrendous affair but judging the movie all on it s own i would have to say it is a very good movie it is a period piece as well as being a thriller with drama set in all the actors do a fantastic job the sets and cinematography are great this is a classic piece without a doubt it has a slow build up as any good thriller should have what is striking about this story is the slow development into unrecoverable terror that the story takes us on when the momentum finally starts it s downhill roll all knuckles are white in anticipation of the final crash but ultimatley it is a story of good and evil in this case both stuggling for the same body ironically displayed in identical twins in this story very good twist on a classic theme so if you re tired of the sex andslice or gamebox movies and want something with a stronger story and character development this would be the one for you hitchcock and depalma fans will certainly enjoy this one 
got milk dario argento fans have nothing to fear anchor bay has done justice to this film the video transfer from anchor bay is simply amazing and the digital sound is great anchor bay has given dario argento fans the cat o nine tails in it s anamorphic widescreen format the pristine video transfer is presented in all it s remastered uncut and unedited glory in my opinion the acting in this film is outstanding for a film from the si think all the actors gave a solid performance in their roles and this film kept me guessing until the very end i knew nothing about this movie until i picked it up at used dvd store but it has quickly become one of my favorite movies whether you re a hardcore or casual argento fan this movie is definitely worth seeing as a bonus some nice extra s have been included in this version ps this movie will make you think twice the next time someone offers you something to drink 
not for the easily offended i find most stoner movies to be too juvenile to bother with this is not a typical stoner movie though because the leads are not slacker losers they re intelligent guys ones an investment banker the other an aspiring med student who happen to like to hang out together and smoke dope which truth be told is pretty accurate of a lot of twenty somethings today the best bits are hilarious watch out for the british twin sisters the evangelical tow truck driver and neil patrick harris doogie howser as a sex crazed drug addled party animal the only scene that fell flat for me was the one with the cheetah pointless and not funny that said this is not highbrow humor but if this were just a series of frat boy jokes it would have fallen as flat as most other movies of the genre what really elevates this movie is the harold and kumar characters silly antics aside these guys are really likeable and have great on screen buddy chemistry i don t know why i haven t seen john cho and kal penn in more movies but the ending makes me hopeful that there will be a sequel 
an identity crisis even though the plot device of characters with split personalities or multiple personalities has been done before identity is at least clever with it this is a really good movie the movie goes like this people end up at a motel due to a bad rainstorm and flooding once there the people start getting knocked off one by one think of agatha christie s and then there were none meets psycho theres the former cop turned limo driver played by john cusack driving a self centered movie star played by rebecca demornay the former prostitute trying to get to florida to grow an orange grove played well by amanda peet the young newly married couple who are far from happy played by clea duvall and william lee scott a convict and the deputy escorting him to another prison played by jake busey and ray liotta respectively the misogynistic hotel manager who has a couple of secrets john hawkesan older married couple and their young son john c mcginley leila kenzle brett loehrthe events happening at the motel are cut in every once in a while by a late night meeting going on between a psychiatrist and a judge and several other people the psychiatrist s patient pruitt taylor vince looks like uncle fester from the addams family and is about to be executed shortly after the shrink is trying to convince the judge that his patient need not be executed for most of the time watching the film you don t understand what the people at the motel have to do with this other subplot some might be confused as to what the heck is going on but the tie in is pretty clever some spoilers below the people at the motel are the different personalities of the uncle fester dude that he developed because of years of abuse and neglect one of these personalities is responsible for a murder rampage the guy went on which is why he is on death row the shrink is trying to convince people that he can get one of the personalities to kill the evil personality so uncle fester won t do anything else evil the are there to do battle but don t know it the doctor eventually taps john cusack s former cop limo driver who signifies the strong good but flawed personality and tells him what he has to do problem is more than one personality is bad and it becomes a red herring fest to figure out who is responsible for the murders it is oodles and noodles better than twisted and taking lives and hide and seek and secret window and plenty of other thrillers that have come out in the past or so years but i guess this still isn t saying much is it anywayvery nice way to spend a late night 
great movie i ve never been to new orleans so i can t vouch for the accuracy of the film in that regard nevertheless i love the whole atmosphere of the film right down to the inconsistent accents the romance is great and i love its portayal of the way corruption can creep up on a person 
a circus of the mind young casey nathan forrest winters has an acute case of coulrophobia fear of clowns so when his two older brothers suggest a trip to the visiting circus casey is understandably reluctant being aware of the young boy s fears his brothers especially the oldest randy a young sam rockwell in one of his earliest film roles tease him a bit and casey eventually relents to prove to his bros that he s not a wimp but at the circus one of the clowns singles out casey and tries to get him to come into the center ring to participate in a skit casey freaks of course and bolts out the nearest opening in the big top their faces are fake he later tells his brothers trying to justify his behavior big happy eyes big painted smiles they re not real you never know what they really are as the boys walk home randy who has been put in charge of his brothers geoffrey brian mchugh and casey while their parents are away is hardly sympathetic and harasses casey relentlessly about such sissy fears after the circus closes for the day three patients who recently escaped from a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane what other kind is there in a horror flick murder the clowns and assume the harlequins identities by donning the makeup and costumes themselves then they demonically frolic into the night and wind up at the home of you guessed it casey and his brothers and the young coulrophobic is forced to not only face his fears but to defeat them thus runs the plot of s clownhouse and while it takes a wee bit of effort to suspend disbelief and accept the coincidence of the evil clowns winding up at the home of young casey the skills of auteur victor salva turn this simple story with its somewhat cliche setup into a polished well paced horror flick that is actually quite scary as a screenwriter salva has a knack for creating frightening situations and making them believable and as a director he is very adept at milking all the emotion he can get from a scenario without pushing it too far over the top and into parody with the exception of the performance from a young sam rockwell genre fans have seen rockwell most recently in sf hits like galaxy quest and the remake of the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy the acting in the film is pretty average fare for a s low budget thriller but the characters do have a comfortable family dynamic mainly due to salva s masterfully realistic believable dialogue indeed salva seems to have a genuine talent for writing dialogue for youngsters as is evidenced again in his later films like s critically acclaimed powder and s boxoffice megahit jeepers creepers overall clownhouse is a well done horror movie basted in slasher overtones one of the few of the post halloween horror flicks of the s that is able to generate scares via the threat of violence rather than through the relentless depiction of gory murders there is in fact very little by way of graphic violence or blood andguts gore in this flick and clownhouse is actually more than just a spook show it is also a rather interesting comment on childhood fears the psychological legitimacy of some of those fears and how a child s life can be negatively affected by such fears if they re not dealt with effectively ironically the public perception of clownhouse has been the victim of real life childhood horror that took place behind the scenes during the film s production this horror came out of the darkness and into the light in soon after the release of salva s film powder when it was revealed that the writer director had served time for the molestation of nathan forrest winters the young star of clownhouse not only did this hinder the boxoffice success of the critically revered powder but it understandably placed a stigma on clownhouse that has caused some critics and viewers to read into the film s plot and visual imagery innuendo that really isn t there fortunately for salva and for filmgoers he was able to remove the dark cloud from over himself if not from over his previous films with the release of his very successful both critically and commercially non genre drama rites of passage and he later redeemed his reputation in the horror genre with the very financially successful jeepers creepers in but reviews should be impartial and examine the merit of the film in question only not taking into account any personal problems that the filmmakers may be struggling with with that in mind clownhouse is an excellent little s horror flick that transcends much of the halloween rip offs that deluged the theaters during the decade the dvd from mgm is a no frills disc that contains only the theatrical trailer as an extra but it does offer a good digital transfer of the flick at its original aspect ratio and while the disc may be hard to get these days it is well worth the search fans of horror or s slasher flicks will certainly want to add this disc to their collections

when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
received the dvd on time and new as specified received the dvd on time and new as specified thank yo 
great series entry friday the th part is definitely a worthy sequel and a very good debut of the modern monster jason voorhees even though jason has yet to wear his infamous hockey mask he still comes off as very creepy kind of like a crazy hillbilly in reality his look was based on the killer on the movie the town that dreaded sundown which is another really cool movie if you haven t seen it the acting in the movie is about what you would expect from the genre which isn t that bad actually the acting isn t important it is all about the gore and how the kids are killed the story itself is really cool and explains that in fact jason didn t drown but actually survived and has been living in the forests for all of the years he has been presumed dead you can see a difference in this jason later in the series in this movie jason actually is afraid of jenny with the chainsaw coming after him in later movies he wouldn t even bother to move overall this is a really cool movie for fans and a great introduction to the jason we have come to know and love without the mask 
very good movie the first time i watched in good company i said to myself eh not good not bad just pretty average a couple reviews reflect that but ever since hbo started playing the movie constantly i find myself watching it more and more and enjoying it more and more the best quality about this film is that it s real you watch the story progress and you feel like you re watching reality i never found myself saying how unrealistic that could never happen the character s emotions seem real the situations seem real that all points to a well acted well written film also the movie doesn t try too hard it doesn t go out of its way to be funny doesn t go out of its way to give you a sappy predictable ending or stupid scenarios that so many movies end with just an interesting plot that flows and moves along with realism in mind instead of hollywood fantasy 
the sky is blue wherever you go it s summertime in hamburg and while it s a time for most people to go away on holiday daniel moritz bleibtreu a serious young teacher is stuck at home a bohemian young woman named juli christiane paul has her sights set on daniel but daniel spoils juli s plans by meeting melek a traveling turkish woman idil uner when melek leaves for budapest the next day daniel impulsively decides to follow her and he bumps into juli as she hitchhikes out of town juli makes a habit of taking a hitchhiking holiday every summer and her destination is always left to chance she goes wherever the passing cars take her in july is basically an on theroad romance the viewer knows that juli is attracted to daniel but daniel is blissfully unaware of this he s so determined to meet a mystery woman under the bosporus bridge that he overlooks juli entirely as they pass through hungary bulgaria and romania on the way to budapest daniel and juli suffer a series of misadventures and at every misfortune daniel becomes less straitlaced and more uninhibited while the film is rather predictable it s salvaged by completely unexpected moments of originality the heavy use of coincidence is forgiven by the plot s emphasis on fate juli s free spirited character is nicely balanced by daniel s stability and occasional stodginess slated to be a popular foreign romance film in july is directed by fatih akin in german with english subtitles displacedhuma 
an adult film in more ways than one this is an excellent film about realistic adult relationships and the compromises we have to make to make relationships work when the film was released in however the homosexuality certainly could overshadow the underlying complex but brutally honest story i think the best way to review the film is to concentrate on the main characters all played so very well by a super cast alex played by glenda jackson is a business woman in her s having an affair with a bisexual artist bob who is in his late s or early s bob leaves her at the first hint of conflict or trouble or confrontation to join his jewish physician lover daniel played by peter finch daniel asks for relatively little and offers an oasis of thought and tenderness for bob this seems to torture alex so much that she can t stop from allowing her feelings of rejection and fear of abandonment from driving bob off the next time they meet most telling is her conversation with her mother where she challenges her mother and father s relationship the father is a cold multi millionaire that long ago ceased to be involved in a passionate relationship with his wife alex s mother confronts her back that she expects to have it all in a relationship and defends her marriage with you don t think it is anything but you are wrong alex is extremely bright and verbal but in many ways a spoiled woman yet to be fair how many people can share a lover it is possibly one of the most difficult tasks in the world for most and can be so traumatic that the constant worry destroys the relationship bob the bi sexual artists does not have to commit to either alex or daniel or to anyone he is handsome young talented intelligent and articulate he is ambitious and sees clearly what he gets from both relationships he doesn t have to commit so he doesn t both lovers alex and daniel indulge him and adore him from his perspective he realizes he does not have to choose between them and he enjoys various aspect of both of the relationships why should he make a choice does he stop seeing daniel so that alex will stop obsessing and fretting i sympathized with bob he was indulged and pampered and knew it daniel the jewish physician was superbly played by peter finch this portrayal of a man living multiple identities was extra special daniel is the talented and dedicated physican who takes calls from patients night and day he is wise and learned and compassionate he listens to opera in a sophisticated garden home serene and reflective yet he is fully engaged in the jewish community in which he was reared the scenes of his nephew s bra mitzvah convey his strong heritage and roots to the jewish community daniel more so that with alex or bob conveys the concept of living different identities daniel recognizes he is part of the jewish community part of the medical community and the patients they see and part of a same gender loving community which exists more behind doors that in the open in whereas alex remains tortured most of the film daniel ends the film with a speech directly to the camera about the limitations of all relationships the compromises we have to make in all relationships and the responsibility to extract from each human experience as much joy and meaning as is possible we have a choice in life we can accept or reject compromise both paths have rewards and hardships this is really the theme of the film after years this film has retained its power since its power resides in depiction of honest lives and honest situations 
definitely the best of the mann westerns yea it s great that most of the other ones are out on dvd but this really is the best of the mann stewart westerns and deserves a criterion quality release man of the west is also a great film although a shade too self conscious and abstract for my taste the naked spur on the other hand is perfect i ve had the privilege of seeing it a couple of times at the pacific film archive here in berkeley the last sequence which involves crossing a raging river on a rope is incredible and as good as stewart and ralph meeker are robert ryan as usual steals the picture see mann s men at war fuller s house of bamboo ray s on dangerous ground and countless other classics he is simply the most underrated actor in american films 
it s more than a movie about jazz round midnight is the most delicate sensitive and deep movie i ve ever watched its a movie that goes much beyond jazz and musicians its a movie about love about the possibilities about us human beigns and amazingly played by two incredible actors dexter gordon and franois cluzet dexter gordon was a special human being he was an angel i really belive this it was up to bertrand tavernier to see it and he did that s why the movie is a masterpiece it s a combination of untouchble and unique souls 
atomic cafe a great documentary with a dark ironic humorous side of american culture as shaped by the cold war paricularly s and s i use parts of this in a class i teach and the students love it how can you go wrong with the duck and cover turtle song and the kid riding his bike in an oven mitt to protect against an unexpected blast 
classic james cagney performance in one of the landmark gangster films of the depression era few performers have become so identified with one particular type of role as james cagney did with the gangster genre and even though in later decades he proved his ability in many diverse areas of screen acting his tough guy playing in early classics like warner bros studios hard hitting gangster story public enemy is what stays in the mind 
newman in a great role paul newman plays a boston lawyer on the skids with alcohol who takes on a negligence case against two prominent doctors and a hospital run by the boston archdiocese it s a sort of do ordie case for newman and it goes pretty badly against him until he is able to get the help of one of the nurses who was in the operating room when the negligence took place it s pretty much a one man show for newman and he does a bang up job we can see into his character thoroughly and it s not all goody goody idealism after he s turned down a payoff outofcourt settlement thinking he has a chance to win and then his chief witness is bought off we see him try desperately to get the settlement money back the trial is pure hollywood with the judge too against him and newman winning the jury over with a plea for compassion and doing right jack warden does a good job as newman s senior partner and mentor as does james mason as the suave and wily defense lawyer but charlotte rampling is a total non entity as the double dealing woman who falls in the sack with newman there s much hokum and predictability here but newman is so good he makes the movie hum definitely worth a watch 
the one n only gigglez i love this movie i can relate to it in soo many ways thats where i got my nickname gigglesi can really relate to sad girl my friends and i all love this movie cant stop watching it we all relate to it like mousie sadgirlwhispersleepyernestoblueeyeswe enjoy it every one should see it because the stuff that happen do happen in real life

a classic sci fi film that holds up well over thirty years later my new year s resolution was to see a bunch of movies i d always intended to see but continually seemed to miss somewhat belatedly i m fulfilling my resolution which is why i finally saw westworld although it was somewhat dated i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this the film concerns delos a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion guests engage in orgiastic sex feasting and heavy drinking and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it one can choose between doing this in roman world medieval world or westworld the film focuses primarily on two visitors to westworld played by richard benjamin and james brolin this was one of the last sci fi films made before the onset of the personal computer yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it according to one book i recently read the cgi representing the vision field of the the gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history so in this way it could be considered cutting edge on the other hand when things start going wrong with a number of the robots the head of technology on delos describes the ailment as a disease today we d obviously describe this as a virus in their software westworld is clearly the stock warner brothers western set that was used at approximately the same time by blazing saddles this works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar though understandably familiar since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes so the visitors to the park get pretty much the western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect even the bad guys seem familiar yul bryner for instance wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in the magnificent seven the visitors quickly fall into the routine james brolin doing an obvious imitation of clint eastwood and richard benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer they visit the local brothel kill the robot played by yul bryner a couple of times get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl then things go wrong on a major scale with the robots going on a killing spree the highpoint of the film is the long chase of richard benjamin by yul bryner a remake of westworld is currently in development i am normally opposed to remakes for the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals even in the case of most sci fi films the remakes of the invasion of the body snatchers were inferior to the original while the original planet of the apes is vastly superior to the remake but this is one instance where if done correctly a remake could improve upon the original the film is well done but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life as a result the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive for instance there are no keyboards but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs the danger of course is going overboard with the special effects the temptation all too often is to go overboard with cgi and spectacular effects in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle my hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum all in all this was a very enjoyable and different sci fi film it was directed and written by michael crichton and i couldn t help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another crichton creation jurassaic park both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie 
oscar nominated screen play should have won i give the film four stars only because of the very soft picture otherwise it would earn a resounding five stars i have been waiting a long time for this film to be on dvd but to find that they are insulting robert ryan again by providing poor quality dvds of many of his films now on dvd most recent example in billy budd which i also have been waiting to be on dvd for eons both the naked spur and billy budd should have been given first class treatment naked is only marginally superious to the vhs due to the soft picture manns other westerns have been transferred better my vhs copy of billy budd is superior to the dvd i definitely won t buy the dvd another reviewer mentioned that a few minutes of billy budd were deleted in order to fit it on the dvd i wonder which scenes they were as for the naked spur it is another ryan masterpiece in engendering some degree of audience sympathy for an essentially psychopathic personality it is amazing how an actor such as ryan can interpret malevolence so well yet be a peace activist in real life when ryan s ben vandergroat cooly murders jesse tate his deep seated cold bloodedness which has only been talked about up to that point in the film occurs at the moment when ben kills jesse ryan s final line to janet leigh as he lays in ambush for james stewart and ralph meeker encapsulates his situation pretty soon roy and your friend howie are gonna show up then i ll get me some more insurance against dying young 
what an experience this film is just beyond incredible a riveting emotional epic picture one of those films whose long length just flies by like that so good you don t even notice or care how much time has gone by it s even more stunning gripping and incredible thanks to the absence of sound events and emotions are magnified and scenes like the huge battle at sea and the famous chariot race put you on the edge of your seat even more the nine scenes in technicolor are also incredibly beautiful and gorgeous and give a sort of otherworldly feeling seeing such a beautiful vibrant color scene in a silent film from one of the last places you d ever expect to see color not being christian i didn t pick up on this at the time but after hearing it pointed out i realise those scenes had in common the fact that they were all religious in nature and drawn from the bible it doesn t hurt matters any either that this gripping epic poignant tale was directed by the great fred niblo and had the script penned by the legendary june mathis who sadly is all but forgotten today despite her prolific career as a screenwriter and how she was one of the most powerful women in hollywood ever and of course ramon novarro as ben hur was simply incredible such a beautiful man in addition to terrifically talented and giving off an aura of a really nice guy as well i wish there were more motion pictures like this being made today as well as more actors who were talented nice people in addition to just having good looks 
turning your back on a people be they jews czechs as britain france did or any people only delays evil turning on you throughout time whenever tyrants arose and preached a mixture of world domination and complete intolerance for most other human beings their first targets were often a small group of people noted for giving the world monotheism the bible and a set of basic laws that have been followed for thousands of years tyrannical regimes always seem to have one common link their deep hatred for jews the words are from a warren kozak opinion piece which appeared in the new york sun august it s hardly a new idea of course yet most of the world still seems disinclined to acknowledge it blatant anti semitism is thus not just something for jews to worry about all folks who champion freedom thus in effect ought see themselves as part jewish themselves either you stand with the persecuted or you are just putting off the day when you might just as likely be faced with similar persecution that s the central point of divided we fall the true and bittersweet story of a czechoslovakian couple whose village has been taken over by nazis during world war ii when a jewish friend escapes from german confinement and makes his way back to their common neighborhood the couple has a choice to make i lived here all my life says the man on the run in the film so i thought maybe someone here might help me but what makes this film unique is the notion that non jews really need to wed jews metaphorically to stand up against anti semitism for without a union of some sorts they are looking for trouble to come their way eventually how the film presents this point is most unusual but i won t get into specifics here not wishing to give away crucial plot details suffice it say that the film exaggerates the above to make its point very clearly and does so with much style and accomplishment that it s a czech made story only reinforces the idea that if you sacrifice a people as britain france did it s only going to temporarily put off the day of your own reckoning with the evil at hand nominated for an academy award for best foreign language film of this picture is well worth watching aug cheers ! 
my god yo man this film was off the chain son very violent though wow no other words to sa 
the key is the key this is a very special film it stars whoopi goldberg an interesting character a real liberal in real life but in reel life you just don t know what kind of movie she ll make some of her movies are very moral and decent the best of them in my opinion is jumpin jack flash the film begins with terry played adroitly by whoopi a lonely single working girl the movie was made in before the internet came on the scene terry works at a major u s bank doing international swift transactions through a then special hi tech communications technology she organizes an im archetype chat room with other bank employees around the world then one day she gets a message on her computer from jumpin jack flash the voice of jonathan price he s a british intelligence agent on a secret mission he s trapped inside the ex soviet union he needs help the kgb is hunting him suddenly terry s life is turned completely upside down the kgb cia and british intelligence are all after her in one way or another at jack s request she goes to a ball at the british embassy in new york city to try and find a man that may be able to help him there she only finds betrayal she find s further intrigue at jack s apartment and through his old flame a hot blonde otherwise known as the lady sara but no one will help jack he knows the risks and he s on his own they all tell her terry pleads with sara you had a thing once you loved him he loved you he still has you picture in his apartment he still loves you ! why won t you help him why do you turn on your back on him when he needs you most after all he s done for you sara simply says im sorry terry gets so angry she replies youre not sorry you re sad and you re no lady other agents jacks s fellow mi friends are being murdered a little girl of a dead mi agent writes kgb in her birthday cake in a most non plussed manner terry puts her job and her very life at risk for a person she doesn t even know when jack finds out she s a woman he threatens to break off all contact with her he is chivalrous of course he doesn t want terry get hurt or killed but terry becomes very mad she tells him ive got better things to do than save your butt bud ! terrys made a promise never to abandon jack no matter that everyone else he trusted has abandoned him she had honor and moral integrity with her word her word is her bond her word is her life her word embodies her honor no matter what the cost may be as such you simply can t help but stand up and cheer for her in a world of women who abandon their children and spouses and others who love them she s special again what terry says she means and in a world of lies and betrayal the cost of truth is great terry is told by archer lincoln a mysterious intelligence agent who appears out of nowhere to get off the stage before you get carried off the plot thickens further when terry is abducted and chemically interrogated by the kgb but no one can break her because she s kind and good and breaks the rules only to help others the angels have given terry the key to saving jack s life she knows the key when no one not the kgb cia or mi has a clue the key is the key jim belushi who plays the chemical interrogator exclaims with exasperation the key is the key ! what the hell does that mean but in fact the key is the key that s the thing terry s smart she s figured out the key it s the key to the song jumpin jack flash bflat this song was made famous by the rolling stones and their lead singer mick jagger but there s one missing piece to the puzzle terry still needs the lady sara s help will terry s heart which always hopes for the best and always hopes for love finally be enough to move sara to action will sara finally become a true lady and will terry and sara save jack before the kgb kills him remember in life just as in jumpin jack flash the key goodness kindness love keeping one s promises forgiveness endurance service selflessness courage risk devotion morality values and honor is the key 
probably the closest to perfection possible i recently watched this film again as i do periodically and thought i d comment several reviewers have pointed out that although the film is uniformly excellent the dvd presentation is lacking and i am of mixed feelings on that point while it s true that the dvd doesn t offer more than the film it s a film of such understated perfection and poignant brilliance that i wonder if we have the right to demand more sure a director s or screenwriter s commentary track or even a quick comparison of this to lumet s earlier and similarly themed daniel would be nice but sometimes a movie is so good it doesn t need help i saw this movie on hbo as a kid probably soon after it came out i feel certain that i must have seen it several times but although i vaguely recalled liking it immensely i went for some years without thinking of it much then i went on a huge sidney lumet kick in owing to his compelling appearance on inside the actor s studio and his intriguing book and rediscovered this to my utter astonishment i began to see that the film had transformed me when i saw it as a kid and it would be months before i unraveled all its subconscious shaping of my pysche this is a gorgeous unflinching and aching film about tough choices and living with consequences and i m glad to say that despite numerous opportunities it never once sinks into the chasm of hollywoodisms that have capsized most films that even attempt something like this it manages constantly to be honest and to present the gray areas of its characters rather than letting them fit into simple archetypes of hero protagonist etc i like that because i don t find it helpful to understand the world in black and white and clearly lumet doesn t either even the most villainous character is given the opportunity to express his point of view and although i don t sympathize with it i at least understand it in short there are really only a small handful of family dramas that i would argue are completely genuine and this is in that august company ordinary people is the only other that leaps to mind at this moment it is a rare accomplishment indeed and everyone in it is at least superb with a couple of performances managing to go even beyond lahtis multiple and heart wrenching inner conflicts toward the end are all clear without being tediously overacted an amazing feat while phoenix s danny captures not only the torment of his character that s in the script but the added burden of being a yearold boy in general so would it be nice if they gave this the special edition treatment of course and i ll replace my copy if they decide to but is the lack of special features an excuse for not owning this an unequivocal no that s like declining to purchase an original michaelangelo because the frame isn t perfect 
movie releasing in march private school despite its weak story line is still one of my favorite s movies fyi it is due to release on dvd in march enjoy 
landmark caper movie the granddaddy of all crime caper movies it s about four crooks who break into a jewelery store and rob the safe only to get gunned down later it s best remembered for the robbery sequence which goes on for almost a half hour and is filmed in great detail with no dialogue or background music their careful planning teamwork and ingenious use of common objects are so admirable that we feel sorry for them when they get killed later on there s a grittiness about the photography and a callousness about the violence of which there is plenty that make the movie an excellent film noir entry the tone is very black the movie inspired a million spin offs which is just another indication of its greatness 
best of the best and wow great movies on one disk they just dont make movies like these anymore 
vietnam without the cynical viewpoint the main thing that sticks with me after watching this excellent depiction of the early days of the vietnam war is towards the end of the movie after the battle when the press helicopter lands and all the reporters gather around gibson and the other soldiers and start asking inane questions it just seemed so jarring and surreal i mean what the hell do you even say after an experience like that i kept thinking in regards to the reporters that they so couldn t even understand and i was only watching the battle in the comfort of my living room not fighting in it ! thats realistic moviemaking when i as a viewer felt like i was part of the experience 
the white is not only a color it an anima state kieslowski was the superb artifice of this curious trilogy white blue and red deals with a delicate mature and painful subject the impossibility of a simple man to satisfy his couple will reach bindings of unsuspected turns an unexpected journey from paris to warsaw will become of him an energy outburst the expected redemption has to be done in the middle of the corrupt battlefield the narrative style of kielowski demands of you all the possible attention his films possess conceptual density ornamented with visible visual metaphors the tragedy and collapse of his beloved poland appears beneath the absorbing script with unadorned realism i would like to you recommend to watch previously his decalogue this fact will allow you to appreciate with major intensity the rat of this unforgettable genius his sensible vanishing left a very remarkable void which still remains pitifully without successor the rest runs for you there are many rich details to comment and the space is extremely brief to face this task go for this treasure 
a powerful and moving story i initially wanted to see this movie because i am a huge oliver martinez fan and i wanted to see more of his work the fact that oliver does not appear until the end of this movie did not really cause a problem for me i was so engrossed from beginning to end with this movie that i hardly noticed oliver was missing javier bardem has to be one of the most passionate actors i have ever seen i was mesmerized by his protrayal of reinaldo arenas and while this movie may not be for everyone i would say it is the best biographical movie i have seen in my lifetime as added bonuses there was oliver martinez for me of course also sean penn was very good in his few minutes on the screen johnny depp had me lauging out loud at his potrayal of the transvite and the officer his facial expressions alone are pure comical genius and while i am a huge johnny depp fan as well i am glad his parts were minimal as javier bardem is the true acting genius in this film i am now going to further investigate reinaldo arenas and javier bardem and see what else they have done that may interest me isn t that the true motivation of a movie or writer making you want more from them 
saturday night cleaver in a year old girl is killed during a game of hide and seek six years later someone has decided to avenge her death by bumping off the now yo kids who caused the tragedy the killer starts by phoning all of the intended victims and threatening them in a whispery voice he then dons a ski mask and sets out on his mission to wipe them all out this all takes place during the build up to the highschool prom where disco madness is the theme and bloody mayhem is the end result ! jamie lee curtis halloween and the fog terror train plays kim the prom queen shes also the sister of the little girl who died and leslie nielson day of the animals creepshow is her dad watch as they disco dance to songs that can only be described as well goofy ! meanwhile the killer stalks the night i like prom night it moves along quickly and ms curtis is always quite watchable ! watch this one as a double feature w carrie 
certain times i like it others i don t how do you separate a socially important film from a great film sure this film tackled the aids homosexuality issue head on but that doesn t automatically make it a great film i m not knocking this film of course not but there s a lot of parts in it that i didn t like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be it is or what everyone makes it out to be andrew beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account his health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he s fired for apparently botching the case turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has aids so he figures that s why he was fired he needs representation so he hires joe miller a top and famous attorney who is rather bluntly very intolerant of gays so they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays one small nitpick it seemed like anyone that is in andy s family or friends circle is against him there was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him a similar problem in brokeback mountain where any scene with the men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking complete with sad looking wives it s nothing that derails the film though and i don t know why but i never liked jonathan demme s trademark of looking in the camera it works for silence of the lambs but here it looks weird and maybe a bit too on the nose now tom hanks did win the award for best actor but honestly it should ve went to denzel washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less thanenthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case hanks in a way reminds me of charlize theron who put on ugly makeup for monster losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an oscar no knock against hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of washington is it a watchable film of course it s quite good and performances are excellent i don t know whether you should blind buy it though that s up to you 
great movie great disc this is one of hitchcock s best movies which means it s one of the best movies period the two different versions of the film aren t really substantially different but the extras are fun and informative if you love this movie this is the edition to get and if you don t love this movie what s wrong with you 
creepy chiller young cameron possesses some crafty telekinetic powers and inadvertantly unleashes a nasty mayan demon a great horror film done in a sitcomish tvmovieoftheweekish style with a healthy heaping of late s style will be sure to please horror fans and scott curtis enthusiasts never really scary but somewhat eerie good sound sequences interesing images cameron is cinematic copecetic 
fabulous performances this is one program i really don t care how historically accurate it is katharine hepburn and peter o toole are such a joy to watch 
the molly maguires this is not a factual account of the molly maguires struggle in the anthracite coal region of pennsylvania between but it is interesting and emotes an emotional element the acting is quite good and it attempts to provide viewers with some balance of reasoning for the disproportionate balance of power and wealth during that time and in the industry that helped make pa the king in coal 
speeding hot great kids movie full of action and interesting colorful cars has drama and creative thinking mom checked kid approved 
one word interesting and for the ending very interesting i was a bit iffy about this movie before i watch it but it was actually a good movie 
crisp and punchy tabloid cinema g men is in some measure a calculated response by warner brothers to the new production code in hollywood and the increasingly strident noises from the catholic league of decency about what it saw as the amorality of major hollywood pictures especially the gangster genre they took their major gangster icon james cagney and put him on the right side of the law in g men james cagney changed sides but not his image there is little to distinguish the ruthlessness of his gangster characters from the actions of his government agent in this movie the persona is still built around cockiness toughness and amorality allied to a dgree of temperamental headstrongness but here these characteristics are deployed on the right side of the law he plays james brick davis a yopung man pit through law school by mckay a paternal big shot crime lord when brick s pal regis toomey joins the fbi on graduataing from law school he is shot and killed by gangsters davis vows revenge and joins the bureau to seek vengeance on the hoods this fierce dedication does not prevent him from enjoying an amorous dalliance with his chief s daughter along the waythe movie is fast paced with mostly short staccato action scenes and propelled along by brisk if somwhat featureless direction by wiilliam keighley in the course of the movie references fictionalised are made to several prominent events of bureau history dillingerbaby face nelson the kansas city depot massacre the kansas missouri bank holdups the movie was made with the full backing of the bureau and featured several actual agents in walk on rolesthis is pure pulp cinema streamlined and to the point cagney as ever is superb and the support performance from robert armstrong barton mclane william harrigan and lloyd nolan are on the money only margaret lindsay lets the side down in the acting department her affected and un natural british sounding accent is incongrous strong second tier gangster movie making slick propulsive and entertaining with scarcely a wasted second 
getting with the jungle rhythm hi everyone ! i hope everyone is doing well ! i loved this movie and there are several reasons why before i go into them let me give you a brief summary of the film the plot this movie takes place about a month or two after the original one ended mowgli has been adopted by a nice family and has a new little brother ranjan who idolizes mowgli for his life spent in the jungle the movie opens up with mowgli telling his new family and new best friend shanti about his former life in the jungle through a puppet show as he gets to the part where he fought shere khan the ferocious tiger ranjan decides to put his own twist on the story and in doing so manages to destroy the set and embarrass shanti in the process ranjan s comment that shanti blinked her big beautiful brown eyes at you and you follow her into our village prompts shanti to turn red and deny she did anything of the sort this prompts a little argument between mowgli and shanti forcing mowgli s father to break it up by revealing that his wife used the same trick on him shanti then makes fun of mowgli before leaving and mowgli tells shanti to watch out for shere khan on your way home shanti dismisses his warning by retorting that you and your stories everyone knows tigers don t come into the village with that she leaves but mowgli soon finds that his theory is right when shere khan comes back seeking revenge against mowgli for what mowgli did to him meanwhile mowgli still misses his jungle friends and they miss him baloo especially baloo wants to bring mowgli back to the jungle but bagheera won t hear it he tells baloo that mowgli belongs with his own kind baloo disagrees and sneaks off to visit mowgli meanwhile back in the village mowgli and ranjan spend their day teasing shanti and playing on her fear of the jungle and especially of tigers but shanti s fear is tested when baloo is successful in whisking mowgli back to the jungle and shanti must save him she is accompanied by ranjan who wants to find mowgli too they encounter kaa who is searching for a snack and almost has one but ranjan stops him right when he is about to eat shanti by hitting the snake over the head with a stick mowgli and shanti are soon reunited again and must face shere khan together the movie ends on a good note and not only does shanti face her fear but mowgli is able to have the best of both worlds he is able to visit his jungle friends and remain in the village with his family and shanti who he discovers he cares for a lot the music this movie had some good songs and even though the bear necessities was reprised three times it was still a good song for the movie there are also two new songs that add to the movie s greatness as well the jungle rhythm which is sung by mowgli and his new friends in the village this song is one of my favorites because it s really catchy and really jazzy mowgli sings this song to show shanti ranjan and his other new friends just how happening the jungle life is his plan almost succeeds until shanti sees what he s trying to do and gets him grounded by accident the other new song is wyld which is sung by baloo and several animals in the jungle this song is not one of my favorites only because i liked i wanna be like you a lot more other than that the instrumental score was really an attention grabber and i also enjoyed the first and last version of the bear necessities musical extras the dvd also has some deleted songs that you can enjoy too the first song is called ive got you beat this song was originally done by mowgli and shanti as a sort of competition to see what was better the jungle life or life in the village although i didn t like the version the dvd showed i love the version on the soundtrack the other song which is one of my absolute favorites is called braver it was supposed to be in the movie but it never made it in because the producers and writers of the movie thought the song would give too much away of shanti in my opinion i think they made a huge mistake in not putting this song into the movie it s on the soundtrack but i like the deleted version on the dvd a whole lot better i guess it s because i love shanti and she is my favorite character next to mowgli and bagheera i love the way they developed her character and i really think mae whitman brings shanti to life and she portrays her very well the reason i think braver should have been in the movie is because it s a really pretty song and shanti has a very pretty singing voice the other reason is that it showed how much shanti was willing to risk for mowgli she was willing to risk her fear to find him which i think is a perfect example of what friendship really is the humor in this movie was easy to see too the humorous parts for me were when kaa the snake kept getting beat up but my favorite kaa scene was where ranjan hits him over the head when he is trying to eat shanti and then after shanti snaps out of her trance and tells ranjan to stop he gives kaa another whack before doing as shanti says ! i find that totally hilarious ! the other thing i really liked about the movie was the one liners between shanti and mowgli i especially love the scene where mowgli makes shanti fall into the river and drop her water jug the look on her face and the way she growled at him was priceless in conclusion i really think anyone who has seen jungle book should really pick up this movie it s a really good one and i even think it s better than the original so get with the jungle rhythm and join mowgli shanti ranjan baloo bagheera kaa shere khan and all their friends for another adventure full of humor friendship and learning where you belong favorite scene mowgli to shanti well keep your eyes and ears open and always watch your back or the last sound you ll hear is ranjan jumps out of the bushes and roars shanti screams and falls into the river dropping her water jug when does the tiger roar shanti you re horrible ! horrible stinky boys ! come on ranjan he s a bad influence they walk into the village now don t move that wasn t very nice you know ranjan growls like a tiger shanti stop that ! you re not a jungle boy ranjan why are you so ascared of the jungle shanti because it s dangerous ranjan dangerwis but mowgli says shanti you shouldn t listen to everything mowgli says ranjan but i thought you like mowgli shanti i do i i like mowgli i i she turns around to see mowgli standing there mowgli you left this at the river hands shanti her water jug back shanti thank you ranjan she s in a bad mood mowgli hey ranjan want to see a little trick i learned in the jungle ranjan nods and mowgli lassos some fruit down off a tree ranjan that s a pretty neat trick shanti well here s a little trick i learned right here at home she does the same thing but manages to get the whole lot of fruit down ranjan wow ! that s a neater trick shanti like i said ranjan don t listen to him 
another classic to love i remember seeing this film when i was or so with my mom it left an impression and i knew i would have to add this to my classic movie collection how i enjoyed watching judy holliday s performance she was unique with a wonderful sense of comedic timing anyone who collects classic comedies should add this to the list 
great nostalgia trip i was when i watched these shows great memories and soupy sales is an added bonus just amazing how things have changed not sure if this set will appeal to the younger crowd but for us aging baby boomers it s a fun trip 
oh yea oh yea watch this movie i can describe this movie with just words funny 
visually stunning beautifully acted i will admit i am a huge fan of altman but i love this film on its own visually it is stunning the photograhy and lighting are a wonder the film itself is like a canvas for some beautiful art the perfomances are excellent watching the love and great conflict between the brothers is riveting this is one of altman s unsung gems highly recommended 
end of evangelion is a must you can do without death rebirth if you own the series the end of evangelion is the ending the series in many ways needed to have while the original ending was adequate evangelion was never just a story about shinji and with all the talk about adam and third impact it needed something bigger than complete introspection that said both this film ending and the one occuring in the series do compliment each other and aren t entirely at odds the difference between third impact and human instrumentality isn t quite so clear as maybe it shouldn t be nonetheless we get both oh and asuka gets a finale worthy of her character i rate end of evangelion a star flick death rebirth basically the entire series edited into an hour with the idea that asuka shinji and rei are performingdreaming this collectively is beside the point still if you want a proper ending to evangelion the end is a must own 
doctor who and the first download doctor who materialised without his tardis on this my first timelord download in the amazon unbox which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside for a very reasonable sum my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration where he encounters the nestene conciousness the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental a great experience and will not be the last easy to navigate and fun for all the family someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type tardis 
just as great as the tv episodes the great thing about this movie version is that all the original voices of clifford john ritter emily elizabeth cleo and t bone are exactly the same as the clifford episodes on tv basically it is a longer version of a regular clifford episode but they ve added a few new friends and some songs here and there speaking of the songs are actually upbeat and a bit catchy but not so catchy to where i find the tunes stuck in my head for hours unlike some other kid movies ie thomas the tank engine where they play the same droning chorus over and over and over again this movie is a great compromise because my and a year old son loves it and after watching it with him numerous times now i still like it too 
maybe i m biased but this just could not fail with me i love oscar wilde and this story i love rupert everett and colin firth put them all in one movie together and what you have is a delightful production complete with wonderful sets costumes and actors who know how to deliver mr wilde s acerbic wit with brilliance if you re not acquainted with oscar wilde s work this is a good place to start then move on to an ideal husband with the again fabulous rupert everett and the ever charming jeremy northam you ll not be disappointed 
fbi misses chance hey it s really sweet where the fbi girl gets her chance to do that thing with the black guy but come on really if the sexes were turned wouldn t the agent be expected to do something else first 
submarine creature comes after belle creature from the black lagoon is an extraordinary class b film ive seen it when it was first released to theaters in argentina yes i m that old the creature haunted me all over my pre teen years i ve just found this vhs copy and thoroughly enjoy it the original movie was filmed in d format unfortunately i wasn t able to see it under that layout however viewing it in d is a chilling experience the s was what we may call monsters decade this creature is one of the best of them all of course you shouldn t expect the realistic and or surrealistic feats that modern film technology enables this is a rubber creature yet impressive more so in scenes on ground environment the story is quite simple an archeologist finds a fossil hand protruding from a hill side in the amazonian territory he returns to civilization and obtains support for an expedition leaded by mark williams the main sponsor and ambitious entrepreneur the team is completed by scientist david reed and his also scientist fiance kay lawrence different circumstances lead the group into the black lagoon a natural paradise but with the gill man roaming free the creature is increasingly aggressive so action scenes underwater on the jungle or into the tiny ship proceed without respite the film has many outstanding features director jack arnold is very proficient delivering solid sci fi horror films such as it came from outer space the incredible shrinking man the present movie and its sequel imho the creature is his best play acting is very good with richard carlson and richard denning in the leading roles julia adams deserves a special mention outstanding legs and absolutely adorable in her white bathing suit performing an aquatic duo with the creature underwater scenes are great a strange mixture of realism and water balletit is a very good horror movie for all audiences reviewed by max yofre 
mel ferrer directs this movie we are in presence of a film that at least it dared to challenge the delicate issue civilization against enrooted ancestral beliefs whose fate has been previously decreed and the lead man of renovated ideas the film had dated but still conserves the interpretative vigor of anthony perkins and the well known sweetness of audrey hepburn who looks like more an angel than a bird girl original in its purpose 
best movie for children and adults to enjoy together my granddaughter absolutely loves this movie and she s only one year old not to mention that my husband and i saw the movie first and decided we had to buy it for her we have watched and enjoyed it many times 
the fab conquer america these shows are excellent capsules of the early s featuring not just the beatles but davy jones part of the oliver ! cast frank gorshin whom i remember better as the riddler on batman soupy sales cab calloway etcthe point of sale is of course the performances by the beatles presented in very good shape here as opposed to the numerous copies of copies boots and chopped specials the sound and pictures being from a decade old videotape are better than expected and kudos to whoever did the mastering in other reviews the other acts get panned but they are good as well sullivan wasn t just a vaudeville rehash part of the problem with seeing the comedians etc now is that you need to know about the people being referred to such as allen and rossi s bits with sonny liston and lbj overallwell worth the price of admission for these trips back to and 
warm and fuzzy this one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even booth has a heart well more so than we already know the ending got me i got misty over it enjoy with someone you love

the ten commandments decalogue directed by krzysztof kieslowski heartbreaking thoughtful dark films well written masterfully directed with great attention to the smallest details and wonderfully acted decalogue thou shalt have no other gods before me the first film in the series is one of the most powerful amazing performance by wojciech klata as young pawel made me think if we all the prisoners of our pcs are as guilty as pawel s father is decalogue thou shalt not take the lord s name in vain dorota krystyna janda is torn by the most difficult choice a woman has to make between two lives decalogue thou shalt remember the sabbath and keep it holy as in all episodes i ve seen the acting is very good this one features daniel olbrychski as a family man who was forced to leave his wife and children on christmas eve and try to help his ex girlfriend to find her missing husband decalogue honour thy father and mother girl s mother died right after childbirth leaving a letter for her father seals letter in a second envelope not to be opened until my death the girl opens and reads the letter which leads to unexpected complications between father and daughter their relationship would never be the same in astonishingly disturbing depressing and powerful dialog thou shalt not kill a cruel young man miroslaw baka wanders through the streets of warsaw in search of a random victim whom he will murder in cold blood he will be arrested put on trial found guilty and executed did he deserve his punishment yes was his execution the legal murder it depends on how each of us looks at the capital punishment debate decalogue thou shalt not commit adultery one of my favorite episodes a tale of a yearold shy and quiet postal worker who peeps on and later stalks his beautiful free spirited neighbor they meet later with tragic consequences fascinating and very clever decalogue thou shalt not steal a young woman majka kidnaps her daughter ania from the child s grandmother ewa majka s mother whom the girl thinks is her real mother ewa who never felt close to majka sees in ania her real daughter there are no winners in this tragic family war decalogue thou shalt not bear false witness deals with the guilt associated with the holocaust attempting to reconcile the direct victims and those who were not bad or cruel people but were too frightened to do something to help an american woman returns to poland to face a famed lecturer who during wwii refused to help her a year old girl at the time to find a hiding place from the nazis decalogue thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s wife this is a story of the words misinterpreted the important phone calls missed by a second the loving couple has to deal with the serious problems that include the husband s impotence and the wife s infidelity she loves her husband and does not want to leave him even after she learns the sad truth about his condition she wants to end a strictly physical affair with a younger boyfriend her husband does not know that and the tragedy of errors just about to happen decalogue is also interesting because in it we first meet the main character of kieslowski s later film double life of veronique roman the hero of decalogue is a heart surgeon and works in the hospital one of his patients is a young full of life girl who loves to sing and has a heart condition her favorite composers are bach mozart and van den budenmayer a fictitious dutch composer whose music is written by the regular kieslowski s associate zbigniew preisner decalogue though shalt not covet thy neighbor s goods is about two brothers who have not seen each other for over two years and meet for a sad occasion on their estranged father s funeral well it was not too sad because their father never had been too close to them his obsession and the love of his life was his stamp collection one of the best and most valuable in poland along with the collection the brothers inherited their father obsession for stamps and even though they desperately need money they try to expand the collection delving in the underworld of devoted philatelists and shadowy dealers sometimes there is not much difference between both types who have known very well about the priceless stamps will the brothers be able to expand the collection or to sell it with great profit and live happily ever after how much and what are they willing to pay for a small piece of paper you have to see decalogue to find out i just will tell you that kieslowski is always in control here and for such a small amount of time only minutes there is so much action characters development so many unexpected and original plot turns such excellent exploring of human emotions and drives that it would it should it did for me keep you riveting to the screen 
those were the years to say this is a great film is probably an overstatement but it certainly is a great idea for a film gibson looks good weaver looks good hunt acts good weir directs good and the script is better than good much it s a movie about ideas which earns high marks these days as so few flics can make that claim sure it stumbles a bit and the ending is purposely frustrating to carry forward the theme of white guilt and what then shall we do beyond all that it s sensual and unpredictable and pretty damned intelligent seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill i ain t see it for yourself 
sweet cartoon admittedly this show isn t for everyone it can be silly sometimes still it has the potential to be very funny clever and sweet

most underrated christmas movie whether it was because of a low budget or lack of major hollywood star power the writing and acting in this movie is phenominal and really hits you every time you watch it i know that every year when i watch around the beginning of december it always gives me that warm feeling must have for any christmas movie lover harry deen stanton is brilliant and really lets you believe he is an angel mary steenburgen plays her stubborn best and it really gets you yelling at the scream believe the kids are great and take on very emotional roles and you believe them great movie

one more time the greatest of all movies it is impossible to overpraise this film on any dimension of quality visually it is so rich that i have found in my many watchings of it that it is worth taking your eyes off the centre of the screen and just absorbing what is going on at its peripheries depth of image chiarascuro mise enscen mood and texture all are so nuanced the cast is almost the definitive classical academy of french film and drama of the last century only jean marais is missing catch him along with the underrated maria casares who plays the only muted and smewhat boring part in les enfants in cocteau s orphee same period roughyl same visual brilliance and the same five star rating pierre barasseur whose th century grand passion performance from othello is in itself superb the haunting jean louis barrault who with his wife madeleine renaud was the leader in classical french theater post world war ii and of course arletty the enigma around whom the entire film centers i cannot think of any film with such a peerless cast them there is jaques prevert s script and carne s direction is peerless reflecting perhaps his own very enigmatic personality his other films share the visual and dramatic power of les enfants but seem more dated here somehow he found the exact style to create a film deeply rooted in history but not locked into it no one has ever directed such a cast of varied and great actors and given them so much space of expression and style while maintaining a unity the film is balzacian in its breadth of story reminiscent of pere goriot perhaps and covers so many moods and themes and scenes it can be very funny brasseur as the vain worldly frederick lemaitre and so deeply sad barrault as baptiste both of which are portrayals based on real actors of the th century and both of which are genuinely great in their capturing of the grand acting style of the period without this being pastiche or artificial it is impossible to overrate this film if you haven t seen it don t be put off by the idea that it s a period piece black andwhite french and sure to be boring it s over sixty years old now and still profoundly beautiful deeply moving and most of all unforgettable 
catch a rising star you should see this because it has an eary appearance by america yes peo ple that is her real name ferarra who you ask oh casually only the star of ugly betty looks up says ala pulp fiction oh do i have your attention now also in this movie is roary from gg gilmore girls for the ignorant the only thing i didnt like was the blonde who had sex with the older man not only was it innapropriate but also illegal wso parents be aware of this if you re daughter s want to watch this movie it has sexual content especially if they are under age ! now peo ple i am a male and also over so i can watch what i want but i m just saying that for young girls they shouldn t watch this one but we all can watch ugly betty 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods

most gangster movies are over rated white heat is a good movie at any time of the day it isn t a bluff gangster film it s the real deal james cagney was cursed or blessed by the lord to play this part i don t know which 
a little too loving this is a well made and well acted movie if you love baseball and tribute movies you ll be in seventh heaven if you don t already love baseball though you may get a trifle bored by how slowly this loving tribute lingers over its subject like a lover caressing the object of his desire family movie my five year old daughter lasted about fifteen minutes my nine yearold daughter made it almost a half an hour before she retired to the den to watch reruns on the disney channel 
fast foward fun movie this is a great movie some make fun of the cheesy story line but by the end of the movie you will be singing all of the songs ! the dancing and choreography is so fun you can t resist trying it yourself 
another underrated billy wilder sex comedy delight i saw billy wilder s neglected kiss me stupid two weeks ago on letterboxed dvd and cannot get it out of my head i have a special fondness for this movie that was panned by critics originally and condemned by the catholic legion of decency so some of my readers will find this sex farce smutty and unfunny it has a pg rating you can probably tell from these sentences whether you will enjoy kiss me stupid which was filmed in b w panavision in the desert town of climax nevada orville j spooner ray walston and barney milsap cliff osmond run the local gas station give piano lessons and are failed songwriters felicia farr is orville s likeable and patient wife walston and especially osmond are riotously funny and kim novak in one of her best roles plays waitress and prostitute polly the pistol at the belly button cafe location filming for all of my department of defense friends was done at twentynine palms california one or two years after stanley kramer and company tore up the place for it s a mad mad mad mad world many of wilder s best comedies are adult masquerade sex farces which is what this one also is dean martin in a devastating self parody basically plays himself to perfection his dino is a vegas entertainer with car trouble who gets waylaid in climax and forced to listen to failed gershwin songs which are quite good including oh the live long day and the long lonely night and oh sophia be mine from orville and barney the action gets hilarious for me when polly becomes dino s sex customer of sorts for the night but later dino ends up in polly s trailer where mrs spooner is posing as polly unlike wilder s flawed the seven year itch where we don t believe tom ewell really sleeps with marilyn monroe the sexual overtures are more satisfying here i believe that dino does sleep with both polly at the spooner home and mrs spooner inside polly s trailer in the cold light of dawn as in the best ernst lubitsch masquerade farces everyone goes back to their right partner and all eventually seems forgiven something about kiss me stupid appeals to me makes me laugh out loud as i watch it and listen to both dean martin s wisecracks and to the underrated and previously unpublished gershwin songs and especially enjoy cliff osmond s screwball dialogue all of the actors are wonderful and the script by wilder and diamond is refreshingly adult was a time when the censorship board was starting to crumble the masquerade motif is skillfully handled and the wide screen compositions on dvd are excellent kiss me stupid is a wonderful and underrated comedy that certainly won t appeal to everyone but i as least love it and if i make it sound funny then it is probably an enjoyable netflicks rental for you 
the champ in czechoslovakia this is a charming comedy set against the backdrop of the velvet revolution wherein a middle aged musician reduced to playing for funerals marries a russian immigrant for money and subsequently inherits her child when she takes off for a better opportunity in a movie that could have been cloying it is consistently fresh and funny watching the eventual bonding twixt curmudgeon and urchin maybe its not the type of movie i usually go for but i did 
baby i don t care great iconic noir with laconic mitchum as the smitten schmuck who falls for the wrong femme fatale dame and follows her to the end the femme fatale is gorgeous jane greer in probably her best role kirk douglas turns in a great performance as a mob boss who s also suckered by the bad girl out of the past is one of the best noirs ever perfectly capturing the grimness and inevitability of anguish inherent to the style one great one liner after another 
the thing from another world this is the original the remake is the thing both movies are great i suggest that you own both of them and compare 
epic korean drama koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there s plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it s good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it s easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told its a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 
i can t believe the studio execs cut this show this show is an amazing concept with superb execution for a tv drama it s the kind of show that should be on hbo or showtime but the hacks who run the tv studio said it was too expensive better to produce three brainless sitcoms instead of one well done drama i really hope someone else picks it up and brings it back 
aw shucks sweet and funny stuff official meg ryan movie disclaimer if you love meg ryan when she s playing the quintessentially meg ryan character slightly ditzy girl next door all eyes and smiles for miles you ll adore this film and must own it post haste that said this is a larky improbable at times almost too cute vehicle for her charms and those of the who knew equally daffily appealing tim robbins who can play crazy tender and smart like nobody s business here he s a grease monkey full of heart a little light in the cranium but fascinated by the gee whiz pre lunar landing stuff of s american pop pulp science she s einstein s brainy niece in the of sandra dee all white gloves and sparkly eyes doris day suits and brisk collegiate sexiness walter matthau s turn as albert the immortal is a bit heavy handed but he s the zip and zing which makes this improbable romance go he and his band of fellow doddering professorial brainiacs who relish rock and roll and fast cars badminton and cardigans brilliant brit stephen fry brings heavy comic gravitas to his role as catherine s fiancee a plummy sounding gent who calls her munchkin and is so pre occupied with his lab rats and the color of the paint for the new home he s planning to provide for his amore that he misses the point entirely it s about love stupid not an academy award calibre movie i q but not a bad way to pass the better part of a morning or an afternoon either incurable romantics this movie was made for people like us cynics take a pass and pass the sweet peas 
argghhhhh what a wonderful twist on the classic treasure island silver is a cyborg and young jim is a typical teen looking to find his place morph is a wonderful addition and will grab you and pull you into the adventure and fun 
thanks mom from janet this movie if nothing else defines my childhood appearing on the children s hour with ed herlihy every saturday amid early morning rehearsals and all that i saw this movie at least times ! mom was a real sinatra fan there have been so many remakes of what are now considered clsssic songs by sinatra and gang but thanks to mom i have the original lp and know a good rendition when i hear it if ever guess you had to be there and experience the movie i was just yearsold at the time and even at that age able to figure out that pal joey was something special it s fun ! it s a lark it s an era it s rogers and hart 
great cast but writing sometimes falls through the cracks the casting here was excellent ben stiller elle macpherson sarah jessica parker were all great in fact i am convinced that elle macpherson can act because of the movies i have now seen her in she plays decidedly different people in each one she is perfectly cast as joe s dream woman i found eric schaeffer s character the least appealing of the whole cast some of the jokes here are wildly funny the audience is never given a clue that the jane lindquist character is only getting involved with joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her i thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually but was not interested in a relationship with him earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants that part did not make sense this could have been improved by some better writing and better character development the humor here is what makes this worth watching 
warm and fuzzy this one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even booth has a heart well more so than we already know the ending got me i got misty over it enjoy with someone you love 
everytime i watch i cry being first generation in an asian american family my sisters and i can really relate to this movie we watch it about once a year with our mom who is chinese and we always laugh and cry my favorite part is the scene with waverly bringing home her boyfriend to meet the family and how the cultures clash we made our boyfriends who are all white watch that scene especially so they know how to act the part that always brings the most tears is the scene with june and her mom after the crab leg supper very typical of asian american families espcially if you are the first born of immigrants recommended for all mothers and daughters to watch 
a decent film in storytelling worth a look to live does not hold the same appeal for me as it once did in the past however i do recommend viewers to at least take a look at this film the films narrative deals with the lives of fugui and jiazhen a husband and wife with two children as well as fugui s mother the time period is from the s up to the s because fugui has a gambling problem the family loses everything house and possessions which splits the family apart it is a time when the chinese nationalist s and communist s are battling for control of china further the film deals with the social upheaval that is afffecting the lives of many chinese although the film never criticizes the changes incurred by mao tse tung just the view of the how people s lives were affected accomplishes this task very well and although this film does not look deeply enough at the changes taking place in china in the chaotic s s and s with mao s reforms and its affects on the people i don t think that this is what the director had in mind especially regarding the films main protagonists on later viewings i realized that there was much missing in the film which could have made this a truly great film as the viewer one witnesses the changes occuring in china but the real horror of mao s reforms are put on the backburner there is social upheaval occuring but it appears tame in comparison to actual events however fugui and his pregnant wife are the films main protagonists and the film is about their life in this new china with poverty now a way of life fugui decides to work at a puppet troupe after the birth of their first child a son jiazhen returns to fugui however civil war has broken out causing fugui to leave for the fight the rise of mao changes everything for these two individuals in the films narrative and even though they have suffered as many other did too they never complain the film never throws mao at the viewer but he is left in the background of the film however this was a very clever use of directing in order to tell the story of these two individuals this is a decent film of human tragedy which i only feel could have been so much more i recommend the film to those viewers rent it first who are not familiar with this period in chinese history this is not a propaganda film but a film about those caught in the unheaval of turbulent times recommended stars 
this has been a love story i finally made my first purchase from amazon s unbox video downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience for i purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of the twilight zone and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection i don t think it s the most ideal way to see full length motion pictures but for a minute classic tv program i think my lcd monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean aired on september as the show s third season opener the episode is a cold war fantasy appropriately called two about the last two survivors on earth a man and a woman after an apocalyptic world war in written and directed by tv veteran montgomery pittman the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an american infantryman and she is an invading russian soldier like two feral animals they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him the reality of their solitary existence however gradually dawns on them especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue prekrassnyi the russian word for lovelywhat really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting two years before she twitched her nose on bewitched a brunette elizabeth montgomery looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun plays the untrusting russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability the american is played by perennial tough guy charles bronson fresh from the magnificent seven even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism they make an odd couple but it works splendidly i also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the nd century narrated by rod serling in his inimitably halting manner the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript this has been a love story this is classic tv

a true gem this film is a masterpeice of spanish literature made into film with classic themes of love honor family and pride this film is one everyone can relate to on some level in addition the use of light in this film will take your breathe away it is so vivid as to be like another actor in the scenes i rented this film with little thought and came away astounded now i own it so if you can watch one movie without a car chase or an explosion you ought to make it this one ! what a gem 
takes me back to my childhood i love this movie and i don t have anything bad to say about it but if you get the dvd be prepared because the movie and the audio tracks do not match so you hear an actor speak before their mouths move this drove me crazy but i still enjoyed the movie 
pete kate stellar performances by o toole and hepburn king henry and his fair lady eleanor full of intrigue and princely plots love me hate me leave me episodes throughout in the end king is jubilant queen goes back to jail and the naughty boys resume their plotting to seize the throne o well what family doesn t have its ups and downs this is an oldie but a goodie 
an entertaining murder melodrama dedicated to hitchcock whom truffaut admired so much it tells us the sordid revenge of a suddenly when leaving behind the church minutes ago his husband is shot by three men he will assume the role of fair agent even she has to be in jail in order to come to the last act jeanne moreau as always was magnificent and the rest of the cast too 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
a true disney masterpiece this was the first disney movie i watched as a child i would still watch it today disney successfully humanizes the movie to children by using friendly animals while still keeping the main storylines intact thumbs up to the music love goes on and on is a moving piece and even hits my hard heart parents with younger children be warned some scenes may frighten them 
logan s run i have always loved this movie but it was very hard to find it is such a relief to have a place to find rare movies in such great condition this movie will make you really think about the future and also about how far our movie technology has come 
daughter likes it and so do we my year old daughter likes her dvd dad bought it for her because he remembered it from his childhood he was disapointed that some of the skits he remembered were not included in the dvd but on the whole it rated well with him it gets watched pretty often in our house 
excellent rabbit fantasy i love this story for my boys it is now a story i put on for my grandson it keeps their attention and there is always something going on i do wish that the few cuss words that were put in this movie had been ommitted you should explain that this has nothing to do with your religous beliefs it is really entertaining i love the bird and i love the song bright eyes i would recommed this for anyone and up i don t think girls care for it as much as boys 
who looks good in a film about pow camps after looking at some of the reviews i ll admit i m a bit confused i think this was made after gettysburg so any motivation of remorse couldn t have had much to do with andersonvilleas a younger civil war war of northern aggression student i read mackinlay kantor s book andersonville and while there is much vile to see in this film it does show why the written word is still the most powerful weapon in war kantor s descriptions in writing defy depiction by even the most skilled set dresser and nobody i mean nobody federal or confederate officer or enlisted man young or old can come out a situation such as andersonville looking particularly well and the post liberation photographs show it just as do the post liberation photographs of auschwitz dachau and bergen belsen the german film of the s the doctor of stalingrad which purported to show conditions in a german pow camp in the soviet union after world war ii and the great film harts war depict relative shangri la conditions for someone who knows little about the pow situation during this great american conflict i would recommend the dvd andersonville but not in isolation it must be tempered with a rounded knowledge of conditions in northern camps which do appear on the history channel regularly and recognition that after prisoner exchange was discontinued nothing short of genocide on a fairly grand scale could result i recall a television documentary about the trial of the andersonville commander whic starred of all people william shatner back in the s or so which i was quite impressed with and should be resurrected but for the present films such as andersonville are replete with underlying messages about the horrors of war that humans make war and then complain about the conditions which are inevitable and that despite our intelligence we have not found an alternative to it yet if this film inspires one intellect to put his or her head to the solution of this problem then there will be no more andersonvilles this film shows how easily humans who are civilized we think can descend into the psychosocial dynamics of the crowd the group the herd plundering and devaluing of human life to that of mere livestock 
accurate and fun comically captures the s zeitgeist while exposing the logistics of mbo slbos better than most business school texts highly recommended 
mountains eh the storyline of the movie is a simple one two soldiers are captured by people who live in the mountains the leader of the people of the mountains wants to trade them for his son who is in prison so the leader tells the two captured men to write their mothers and tell them to come and get them and they will make a deal and so on and so forth the movie is not one of the greatest movies that i have seen but it was not a terrible piece the ending is great and completely unexpected and i m not sure if it s just me but the plot and character motivation seemed to be derived from the viewer s common sense rather than from any real motive in the movie for example the older soldier kills a sheep herder the whole exchange seems like something out of monty python throughout the movie there is a sense of humor me and the person i watched it with were laughing hysterically at a few scenes most notable when the prisoners get drunk and at random times throughout overall the film gave off a surrealist feel it never quite seemed real at all the exchanges between the characters just keep getting more and more unrealistic im not sure if the writer planned that or not but it does seem to lag near the end the movie definitely loses points on that front also there never seemed to be any real connection between things the beginning threw me off and when they attacked them and brought them back on horses that threw me off it was somewhat difficult to get into the movie but once it got going it was easier to watch then it drug and then it was over not a recipe for success in my eyes although i m not sure if that is the way russian cinema is but that certainly isn t the way american cinema runs at least not the kind that is deemed of good quality but overall i would recommend watching it it is a good movie but be sure you re watching it with someone else so that you are able to laugh with them and share a few raised eyebrows at the plot and how doesn t seem to be realistic 
the mighty mighty i purchased this movie again because i lost my first copy i used it as a follow up to the reading of the book by the same title my at risk junior high school students enjoyed both the book and the movie the theme is timeless and the film is well acted it can be seen over and over again

very very good comedy as other reviewers have said leonard maltin is absolutely wrong about this film the comedy is very tight and well timed the dialogue is the wittiest of any movie i ve seen from the era it does tend a little toward one liners but it doesn t matter because it s fall outofyourseat funny ingrid bergman is divine in a role you would never have expected for her the signs of the times are ubiquitous references to quotthe pill quot quothippiesquot quotsquaresquot etc but the comedy is far from dated the best aspect of the film is its unconventional plot romantic comedies are highly predictable as a class this one keeps you guessing puts even neil simon to shame highest recommendation 
the search for shangri la this is an excellent documentary of shangri la and its elusive transcendental nature 
triumph of the will for the s my review s title is not to imply barbet schroeder is a manipulative filmmaker like leni riefinstahl nor to say the film looks at idi amin purely in a positive light both are far from the truth it refers to the fact this film like triumph of the will looks at a cruel dictator during the height of his power and while he was alive and well enough to actually partake in the film because of this the documentary holds some historic importance not just for african history but world history in general the documentary is a fairly straightforward one some have found it boring and admittedly there seems to be not much form to it although in schroeder s defense few documentaries are much of it is following amin around and watching his daily life as he would probably most like to see it he gives the film crew a tour of uganda wildlife including a focus on crocadiles allows them to film a cabinet meeting and displays a wargame simulating an attack on the golan heights at times it almost seems like idi amin is greatly enjoying the limelight during the wargame he is pointing up to the sky saying film that jet or film that helicopter and the cameraman complies if you re interested in idi amin or african history then it will interest you and provide insight on a regime that eliminated hundreds of thousands of ugandan citizens if you aren t then it probably will bore you and be thought of as a cookie cutter documentary the special features include an interview with director barbet schroeder on how the film came about and what it was like to work with idi amin two interesting stories in particular arose from it one was when amin and schroeder were watching ugandan television footage and amin was infuriated that it showed him shaking hands with a foreign diplomat using his left hand schroeder replied no that s normal it happens everywhere it just means the editor switched the footage around amin replied oh so it was the editor what schroeder hadn t realized was that the cameraman had already been killed and amin afterward killed the editor schroeder kept his mouth shut after that the second story involves the film s initial release amin was not happy with the original cut and demanded schroeder edit the film when schroeder refused amin rounded up french citizens in uganda and threatened to kill them unless schroeder complied schroeder did and the film wasn t restored to its original cut until after amin had been overthrown in a rare personal look into one of the cruelest dictators of the th century i would recommend it to any one interested in the subject matter most definitely

when i was very small this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young

dein perry s tap dogs good show mates winner of international awards including the obie award tap dogs is like nothing you ve ever seen a must see for all tap dancers and anyone with an interest in tap dancing this spectacular show successfully gives a look at new age tap dancing of the nineties tap dogs showcases the incredible dancing talents of six australians who simple crackle with blue collar energy led by dein perry the creator of the show the other five members are ben read nathan sheens gerry symonds drew kaluski and darren disney recorded live at the lyric theatre in london here is a list of musical numbers for the show main title best foot forward as the title and beginning credits appear we watch as dein perry almost casual taps on the stage mix n match only their feet are seen as five pairs of boots appear inside a frame caution as one reviewer complained there is a crude moment during this scene so parents be cautioned if watching with younger children solo steps one by one the six members get their solo moment to show off their talents favorites solo steps would be disney s helloooo gorgeous is yelled out to him from the audience and read s i can t see how he pulls off the toe steps dancing between the cracks as a large piece of board is being lifted slanted forward for the full view of the audience the board is pulled apart so that the dancers dance beween and over the cracks two man routine dein perry and ben read tap while being seated starting from the basics until the steps become more and more complicated fancy footwork ben read and dein perry each do a long solo number one of my favorites parts of the whole show tapped into the beat nathan sheens slides in carrying a basketball and does a short number tapping as he dribbles the ball faster and faster in a few moments he discovers six floor tiles which are actually something like a synthesizer eventually all six members plays music while tapping on the tiles in complete synchronization the music gets very funky towards the end a definite highlight from the show dancing on the ceiling dein perry leads the others into a jazzy number and gets the audience to keep the beat by snapping their fingers has some humorous points with perry keeping his men in line after a bit we see gerry symonds tap dancing while hanging upside from the ceiling wire tapping i simply love the music played during this number lots of synthesizer and cool bass the performers dance while pulling and dancing around wires which are strung from the ground to a frame above an uplifitng performance the previously mentioned wires are pulled up lifting steel plates at angles which the performers dance on soon the plates are lifted straight up vertically revealing them to be ladders on the reverse side soon the tap dancers are actually tapping while climbing up and down the ladders man at work spotlight is on dein perry as he does a number on a grate with a type of microphone strapped to his legs which echo the taps soon he wears protective goggles and the other members of the show use construction tools to shower dein with sparks in exact rhythm reaching new heights the guys start building a frame which in the end makes like a huge staircase it s interesting how they can still dance while actually building this frame splash dance what might be the funnest number dein perry and three other guys wear boots and splash dance getting the whole couple front rows in the audience wet ! very funny ending letting everything slide just the piano is heard as the six dancers do a slow but jazzy number while kicking some of the water from splash dance onto the audience one by one they go off stage each receiving a resounding applause last steps almost like an encore this number would have to be one of my favorites of the whole show cool music and the six dancers dance up and over individual little staircases allinall watching tap dogs is such an enjoyable experience these are aussies we re talking about so there s a lot of shouting and calling out among the members and it s so obvious they re having such a great time on stage they are all so in tune with each other it s amazing how they can tap dance even when there s often no music to keep beat ! good show mates if you think tap dancing is old school and old fashioned i highly recommend you to watch this it ll certainly change your outlook forever about tap dancing 
note to s sci fi fan the band is awesome no doubt about it but that s just it they were a band robbie robertson spelling correct somehow fooled the other band members into letting him have songwriting credit and robertson got them to particiapte against their better wishes in the last waltz concert and accompanying film take a look at band drummer levon helm s book this wheel s on fire and he explains that robertson and someone in the band s management talked the group into giving robertson sole or majority songwriting credit so they all could supposedly benefit financially robertson got rich while the others didn t it s a shame since helm keyboardist richard manuel rip and bassist rick danko rip all had better voices than robbie stheres also a great photo in helm s book that has helm showing robertson how to play something on robertson s stratocaster great picture it shows that it was a group effort but robertson and the last waltz film erronneously claim robertson as the leader and chief talent the last waltz concert was filmed by martin scorsese robbie s buddy if robertson truly was the lone genius of the band don t you think his solo work would have been much better also in the words of the arkansas born levon helm himself do you really think a guy from canada robertson wrote the night they drove old dixie down all by himself 
this one gets alot of hate but i thought it was good for a sequel im surprised people actually expect much from them if you go in with an open mind and expecting the standards of a sequel it will be a fun horror flick with a build off of the st one it doesn t go too off track it explores the environment the cenobites exist in that you don t see in the st channards an interesting concept too i love the whole phallic innuendo of his character its no masterpiece though they use claymation for some effects and the story is a bit cheesy though we are expecting this id reccomend the rd and th too after that effort just flew out the window 
best of guest of christopher guest s mockumentaries best in show is definitely the best the characters and story gel in a perfect comic concoction best in show is very different than waiting for guffman the first film in the guest trilogy although it brings back many of the same actors while guffman has a cruel streak in it best in show is a little kinder to the characters it skewers without losing the laughs i would skip the third film in the trilogy a mighty wind unless you are looking for a bittersweet drama it s just not that funny if you are jonesing for a mockumentary fix search for gsale a quirky comedy very much in the christopher guest vein it got a lot of great reviews and was even labeled the movie christopher guest should have made instead of a mighty wind 
finally a good title goes out of print from criterion i have recently purchased this recently out of print title from the criterion collection and i must say i was pleasantly surprised not only is the harder they come a perennial cult classic it is also a surprisingly great movie it is a film with an all jamaican cast shot in jamaica with an excellent soundtrack that introduced reggae music to the rest of the world it stars musician jimmy cliff as a young man who moves from the country to the city of kingston where he faces poverty and depravity tries to make it as a musician only to ironically become more famous as he turns to a life of crime what would have easily been a trashy exploitation film is transformed into a thoughtful artistic and compelling film of admirable quality it is also wonderfully acted but you may need to use subtitles to understand what they are saying through their thick accents overall a great film on an out of print criterion dvd that you may want to pick up 
jungle holocaust aka cannibal holocaust the beginning a film by ruggero deodato cannibal holocaust a plane crashes in the jungle one of the survivors named robert harper massimo foschi gets lost and while trying to find a way out of the jungle he gets captured by cannibals he is humiliated stripped naked and thrown in a hole with a bird for a while eventually he escapes with the help of a beautiful cannibal girl named pulan me me lai and tries to find his plane so he can go home this is one of my favorite cannibal movies along with cannibal holocaust that in my mind is the king of all cannibal movies that lives up to its name in being the most controversial movie ever made jungle holocaust is presented for the first time in america uncut and unrated released by shriek show on dvd the movie comes with lobby cards that are extremely detailed i recommend this movie to any one who likes cannibal movies exploitation movies and horror movies this is a most have for any fan of euro exploitation movie fan dvd features for this movie are available audio tracks english dolby digital commentary by from director ruggero deodato rare production stills posters and promotional materials from around the world and director commentary also the dvd comes with trailers for umberto lenzi s eaten alive the original uncut version released by ec entertainment a trailer for zombie holocaust aka dr butcher m d burial ground night of terror and a trailer for beyond the darkness buio omega as well as a trailer for jungle holocaust trailer this movie is also called and is known as cannibal holocaust the beginning i think one of the best things about this movie except for the blood and gore is the amazing music and graphics of the jungle and the wild life 
serious science fiction shocker tuesday is soylent green day that ominous statement is delivered in the film as a kind of tv advertisement an informational message aimed at the desperate denizens of an utterly socially ravaged world not so far removed from our own tuesday is a day they can look forward to because they can get soylent green considering the dismal nature of this future society it s something which is sadly believable this film remains one of the more starkly realistic and disturbing portrayals of a future in which people have almost nothing of their own including food and shelter they have little human dignity left either this is not the glorified future of star wars with blinking lights and merry talking droids and wise teachers over flowing with hopeful messages it s a dirty ridiculously over crowded nightmare where people treat each other as little more than cattle and even love is a dangerous luxury charleton heston plays a cop investigating the brutal murder of a powerful business man in his quest to find the truth he uncovers a thing so shocking it takes away loved ones nearly robs him of his own sanity and leaves the viewer with such uneasiness it approaches the dark tone of a horror movie however what makes soylent green so powerfully unsettling is that so much of the fictional story could indeed come to pass indeed this cautionary tale is even more timely now than when it debuted back in the s if you re looking for a sci fi romp through a colorful world of zippy space ships and wacky alien races look elsewhere this is hardcore uncompromising science fiction which will stay with you 
perfect love makes perfection in all i find it odd that when reviewing the reviews of this film that people seem to either give it perfect or abysmal scores the dichotomy of opinion is probably a direct result of the skill and immense power of leconte s images especially those that his chosen actress affords us leconte is a master and quite possibly the greatest living auteur currently making films his movies often contain a refreshing difficulty that gives one hope that images still mean something that film is still worthy of being explicated that someone still cares enough to think that much without being overly clever such as the coens and anderson i shouldn t say still i should say is and will be as leconte is on a different level than any who has ever worked including kieslowski the master of images i enjoy how leconte has said that although it was his second period piece he approached the film as if that had nothing to do with it learning from ridicule i should point that out i have no problem with ridicule and the fact that it is a period piece has a great deal to do with the presentation but i can see what he meant like i said i enjoy the statement but i should also point out i m a jerk binoche and auteuil are two of my favorite actors and this film shows them at their virtuosic best they deliver amazing performances of a truly passionate couple who both hold unconditional love for the other which in itself contains ultimate trust of decision and character possibly more auteuil s for binoche s but the sympathy generated by his character fuels her as an equally sharing partner making any difference negligible there is a third character neel but he is there only to accentuate the relationship between the other two the movie quite simply is about unconditional love and what it means to love unconditionally there is a subplot of equal merits mainly concerning neel about the belief in redemption and what it truly means to believe in redemption in short it is about the consequences of action through belief more so out of the love for another than those of moral ground or stance some people are not willing to accept the belief that actions can or should occur solely out of sympathy for another some people will never allow themselves to love unconditionally some people will not understand or even like this film binoche deserves a prize that doesn t yet exist for her most exquisite performance leconte deserves recognition for what he has done and what he has given us with this film certainly one of the best i have ever seen 
what the deal is i thought this movie was preety good fred did a great job with his charater jefferson bolt and the story board was as good as his former s movies like hell up in harlem and black ceaser if your a fred willaimson fan then this is difinitely one of his movie s you should add to your collection 
a brilliant film this film tells a powerful story a crime and punishment esque recovery of the soul except without the ending that dostoevsky had in his novel after neel auguste committs the murder madame la juliette binoche much like dostoevsky s sonya takes on the monumental task of recovering a lost soul and succeeds those who suggest this film is unrealistic have no grasp of eternal christian values of compassion and those who call this film ideological propaganda have no appreciation for beauty as the acting by all three especially kusturica and auteuil whom i have discovered through this film and who almost eclipse the talented binoche the cinematography and the directing are absolutely brilliant this is a must watch for many different kinds of people from those interested in st pierre miquelon i had to look up the islands on a map and was surprised to learn they are french not canadian to those who would like an illustration of why there is never a soul lost forever to those who would just like to receive aesthetic pleasure from a beautiful film finally some have commented on the character of neel auguste saying that he is retarded for not running away do not let a comment like that fool you it would not be made had the reviewer understood the character or even picked up on a direct quote from madame la you are so fatalistic never trust someone who tells you not to watch a movie watch it and decide for yourself i cannot envision that you wouldn t like it 
sergeant york cd so glad that this wonderful and inspiring movie finally made it to cd format wonderful quality this is my husband s all time favorite movie and it is definitely worth viewing again and again for the inspirational message it delivers 
shattering this film is slick and shattering with an underbelly of sobbering disatisfaction christie is pognient harvey is cool with cracks of vulnerability that informs the emptiness of his life bogarde is sympathetic and callow a basically good man who is seduced by an elusive beauty that could never be the direction is crisp the music and sound very good 
an intense look at the psychological aftermath of war this is a great movie the time immediately following the second world war the place scotland specifically the scotts highland regiment the regiment has returned from hard combat in north africa and europe and once again is esconced in its barracks in the scottish highlands the place in which it has been headquartered for over three hundred years the acting commanding officer is col jock sinclair alec guiness a rough uneducated man from the lower classes who worked his way up to colonel from the ranks sinclair got his promotion in the desert fighting rommel and one senses that these experiences have created strong bonds of friendship between sinclair and certain other officers in the battalion now higher headquarters has assigned a new commanding officer to the battalion col basil barrow a university educated man from the upper classes who comes from a long line of officers who served with and indeed commanded the battalion but barrow for all that is viewed as an outsider and newcomer while the other officers forged friendships in the war fighting the germans barrow was in the pacific theater sinclair is relegated to second incommand sinclair is deeply resentful of barrow and immediately gets off on the wrong foot with his new commander unintentionally belittling barrow s war service most of which involved the horrors of being a pow tortured by the japanese in fact colonel barrow is deeply scarred by his wartime experience and has lost perspective in dealing with his officers he is a martinet and appears to forget that leadership involves earning the respect of one s subordinates it is not simply bestowed from on high although both men love the regiment above all else this film is about an implacable conflict between sinclair and barrow for sinclair does not respect barrow who he views as a spry wee gent who will not command the battalion for very long the interaction between barrow and sinclair provides for an intense psychological confrontation this is a war movie without a war none is needed this is a superb study in leadership confrontation loyalty and the nature of the tradition rich highland regiment the class divisions among the regimental officers is interestingly portrayed the entire cast turns in a fine performance and guiness is truly stellar as the rough spoken colonel sinclair the dvd is beautifully remastered with crisp audio and video i ve been keeping an old ratty videocassete of this film for years hoping that the film would eventually turn up on dvd now it has and any film afficianado will enjoy this crisp fast paced and intense story

draws deeply from the well of man s most instinctual fears truth be told i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively when this thing gets going though the descent easily attains not tobemissed status and on top of all the incredible special effects oppressive atmosphere and grievous bloodletting made with a pretty limited budget by the way one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner are you kidding me blood gore a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn t believe and subtlety how could i not give the descent five stars so you ve got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky extreme activity white water rafting for example everyone has fun but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women sarah shauna macdonald forever still recovering from her terrible loss sarah joins her friend beth alex reid in america where mutual friend juno natalie mendoza an alpha female if there ever was one has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored joining in the fun are holly norajane noone juno s new gung ho sidekick and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure once they descend into the cave system though things start getting more intense fairly quickly their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses that s when juno a woman with more than her fair share of secrets admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before supposedly to help reunite the group well it does just the opposite but they just have to keep going if there is a way out they re going to have to find it the hard way things are already creepy enough at this point the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets making the viewer feel as if he she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic but the real fun was just about to begin in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you ll ever want to squirm through sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them no one believes her at first when the crawlers attack though all hell breaks loose two miles under ground these gollum like creatures are some kind of blind albino humanoids who hunt by sound can scamper and climb like monkeys move unbelievably quickly and really tear into whatever flesh they can find not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light and when the girls fight back it s cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy bloody gruesome department and even as characters are fighting for their lives a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences didn t get to see the true final scene of the film for some pretty questionable reasons a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference don t worry though as the dvd has both endings available the descent draws deeply from the well of man s most instinctual fears making it one of the most atmospheric heart pounding movies to come along in quite a while the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film and plenty more on top of that if you care the first thing about horror you must see this atmospheric tour de force 
funny funnyfunny even though this is about years old it is extremely halarious i ve been waiting to see a good stand up comedy the first min is just one hilarious hit after another i love this guy 
gary cooper s god country this is one of the best american films ever it stands out as a monument to america s greatest era it has the most representative american actor of all times gary cooper and possibly the second best american director ever howard hawks it s a piece of americana it s a religious patriotic social and political film but above all it s a masterpiece its key moment truly beautiful is when york is rummaging about his dilemma between god or country then he finds those illuminating verses to caesar what is caesar s and to god what is god s ask yourself if in americans are giving each its due or rather stealing from them the film is respectuful to the religious beliefs of people it portrays the commonsense and hardships of hardworking country folk with no abuse or ridicule it is emotional and funny it is realistic and sensitive it has great trench war scenes wonderful family gathering scenes and beautiful settings in the country nobody but hawks or john ford could have risked making this complicated film and come up with something so perfect it s embarrassing to think of what could be done today with a story like this one especially when political social and religious elements are involved hawks handles every thread of the story amazingly curiously enough the real alvin york requested that cooper play the leading role and would not accept anyone else to allow the rights for the story and he also requested that the girlfriend didn t drink smoke or swear and she does a splendid performance too she was only the extra disc comes with documentaries one hour long about the story of the real york and another some minutes about cooper s career and hosted by clint eastwood pretty good both the value of the film itself is enough for any classic film collector to rush to get it but as i said already it is also a piece of americana worth using as an educational tool in towns that have forgot how truly great america once was with god country you have gary cooper no god welfare you have michael moore 
beautiful film most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is i am a long time u fan and had seen rattle and hum but didn t get around to purchasing the dvd until late the fact that the music is wonderful is a given but the cinematography is just astounding i love how you get to see everything from every point of view you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage including the breathtaking sea of fans you get to see what the fans see the spectacular lighting and silhouettes you get to hear what the guys think and feel off stage as well as on and of course you get the passionate music the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to i couldn t ask for more

nostalgic when an individual buys a movie it is in order to watch it several times unless one is a reseller so to buy a comedy to think that one will laugh at the same jokes a hundered times is foolish the movie is enjoyable due to its excellent cast and quirky humor there is nothing overbearing about the movie which is a nice departure from the majority of movies out there two cast members are now gone the plot is simple the quirks are clever enjoy every now and again when you miss the s its actors and the style of thought you had when you were a kid 
decent teen flick brittany is a senior in pacific vista high school and she has high hopes for the oncoming year as captain of the cheerleading team but all that changes dramatically her father s job has relocated and brittany has to move with them including go to an entirely new school she can t be captain of the squad anymore and she turns power over to winnie she makes an oath to never do what she loves again cheerleading to avoid a reputation of being a cheer wh now she finds herself at crenshaw heights high school a predominantly african american high school at her old school brittany was known as rich and popular but now she is only recognized as a minority nicknamed white girl she is drawn to the new squad and attempts try outs clearly dominating amongst all the other participants cheer captain camille and brittany put aside their differences and camille invites her to join pvhs is having a homecoming dance and her former quarterback boyfriend has invited her also with hopes of sleeping with her afterwards her old friends discover she didn t keep her promise to refrain from cheerleading and her new friends find out she skipped a game to go to the dance now she s rejected by nearly everyone but brittany manages to apologize for her mistakes and brings chhs to victory at the cheer competition i expected this to be a tween flick as the previews made it seem like it was designed for a younger audience i can still see kids in that age group watching this but the crude comments and other components of the plot proved otherwise this film didn t appeal to me at the beginning because it focused on being popular and poor little rich girl you know what i mean but once the movie gets going you realize that brittany does have some typical struggles in high school and the message it brings across isn t all that bad this film isn t too shabby after all but i still like the first one the best ! 
a good buy i bought this for my husband and had never watched it before its a good movie with a good plot it keeps you intrested and has some parts that make you do a double take its not really scary but its susupenseful but it is not for young children at least ones that are used to horror films there were parts that it lagged in but it was quickly picked up again plus it ends the way you want it too 
great service we thought the tape was in excellent condition and the delivery service was very efficient 
how to hunt a mammoth the devil s backbone is a horror movie like you ve never seen before a good and intelligent one it really is not a horror movie however but a story which involves ghosts or the past and how they fuel our present actions and decisions it is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you worth seeing 
my favorite version i absolutely love this version of emma i enjoyed kate beckinsale and mark strong as emma and mr knightly the scenery performances screenplay and attention to detail combine to make this a wonderful adaptation i have another verson of emma but nobody does jane austen better than a ebbc their attention to details such as costume music scenery food etc can t be beat 
very compelling film when i first saw this movie i really didn t know what to think its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for enjoyment that being said i love this movie and here s why it s a true story it is extremely patriotic even if it s patriotism displayed by the wrong country how can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country this was well produced in my opinion and i feel the only flaw was harrison ford playing a russian if you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing but i appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
the gypsy journey fascinating educating beautifully done congratulations to the film maker and the sound maker a story in music louder than words

the unbearable lightness of being dvd heya very speedy delivery thanks the dvd works fine in a portable dvd player but for some reason disc wont play in my mac powerbook i think its because there is a slight edge on of the disc and my computer is to sensitive to allow it to play oh well thanks heaps tams x

when a woman s fed up i hadn t seen this movie in years until this past weekend when it resurfaced on tv whew what a welcomed blast from the past martin lawrence was still in his heyday as a comedian in this movie s release a sober bobby brown delivers an entertaining performance as martin s pseudo sidekick regina king plays a believable it girl role and lynn whitfield totally delivers an oscar nomination worthy performance as a woman scorned and determined to make her man pay for all the heartache that comes from lies and deception this is one of those twist offate movies for playaz who manipulate relationships just to get some and move on the story is easy to follow theres tons of subtle but gutbustingly funny scenes the movie moves along at a great pace you won t go to sleep on this for anyone male or female who s ever had an adventure in dating with a nut you later question why you ever dated this movie s for you as the movie s theme song says the sweetest woman in the world could also be the meanest woman in the world did you make her that way youre just gonna have to watch this movie to get it 
arkin is clouseau this is one of the better inspector clouseau movies it is not as ridiculously silly as some of the others arkin gives a very credible and amicable performance as clouseau you can empathize with him and he has a certain charm about him the plot of this movie is interesting and the villain s plot is quite plausible adding to this movie is some very impressive location photography ingenious title credit animation and a solid and catchy score by ken thorne 
what a movie more hong kong action from the greats you really should see this movie if you re into hong kong action the shoot outs are great and the action is incredible i also really love the story also you can really see alot of john woo s tradmarks appear in this movie like the use of dove s and religion a great movie 
dying young moves us with its precious life love conquer all meaning i find it refreshing whenever hollywood puts out atouching love story which involves real life situations beautiful performances are given by campbell scott julia roberts in this highly insirational film if you thinkthis is just a depressing movie dealing with a mandying this is not so i found that victor the yearold man suffering from leukemia since is a verysharp educated loving person you really cant helpto not only like him but really pull for him as youwatch this film it s interesting to see julia roberts hillaryin a role where she experiences such unconditionallove for a man in his condition he is strong yet weak she is naive but smart what i took away from dyingyoung is how victor hillary both share this transition ofexperiencing unconditional love through such an adversesituation its very inspiring for us to see how such strong lovecan be such a gift two understanding people in love cansuccessfully melt all of lifes fears away by allowing it it has surprisingly well humorous moments so there is a nicebalance i appreciate that this movie is not doom gloomby showing the human spirit can not be defeated when unconditional love is present victor hillaryhelp remind us to live each precious moment in our livesto its fullest how inspiring 
hey look ! a war movie i like like many of the other reviewers i went into the movie thinking it would be about the horrors of war but it was much more than that it was a story about prejudices and how they can exacerbate already terrible situations it was remarkable to see the interactions between the chechens and their russian prisoner on a human level they were so similar in another life they could have been friends but in that moment they were enemies and no matter how comfortable each were acting you could tell they never forgot that the movie started out very slow but toward the middle it started to pick up there were some very funny moments i m not sure they were supposed to be funny but i had a good laugh overall not a bad movie but not for everybody 
this film kicked ass western fans you ll love this film the other reviews where they re saying this film is dull just didn t watch it right the gun fight at the end is so awesome randolph scott and joel mccrea give moving performances and the outlaws are so dirty and evil peckinpah s direction is great all the great landscapes in the film are beautiful it s a must see 
a modern classic while this doesn t come near the genious of it takes two this wonderful movie is certainly a hamlet of its time the questions raised can a year old date a year old or should he wait a year and be are timeless and who can forget the acting all i can say is that when oscar season came around i cannot have been the only person who was amazed that the actress who portrayed claudia was not nominated in addition viewers learn about the set up of the human skeleton in a delightful number performed by the bsc the rivalry between cokie and kristy is my favorite moment as i tend to side with cokie i mean seriously a baby sitter s club when cokie has horses internationalmale co 
an entertaining ride a road movie for the fairer sex boys on the side is helped immeasurably by the performances of mary louise parker drew barrymore and whoopi goldberg the latter plays a lesbian nightclub singer who agrees to share the wheel with repressed straight laced parker on a trip to san diego following a serious misadventure with her drug pusher boyfriend the still pixy ish barrymore joins the journey boys on the side is as contrived as a soap opera with each character facing a personal crisis but the three stars are so good it s easy to overlook the frequently smarmy plot developments and enjoy the performances parker is particularly good especially when she unwinds by lip synching to elvis presley s jailhouse rock the soundtrack is nicely compiled too and features performances by the likes of sarah mclachlan bonnie raitt the indigo girls and annie lennox brian w fairbanks 
the best of all movies about jesus so far this was an experience rather than just a great movie for me i have very often wished i were there at that time and have endlessly envied the people who saw and heard jesus i did not expect that matthew would bring me as close as possible to my wish the director s and bruce marchiano s vision and understanding of who jesus really was their attention to his words about his joy produced a wonderful movie i think that for people to follow jesus leaving their life behind in a moment he must have been a very warm friendly caring man a young fit tanned carpenter who walked miles in the sun to get around bruce marchiano did an incredible job showing us that we have been so conditioned to avoid affection and touching people that many of us think that s the way human beings should act with each other yet in the middle east it is customary to this day for men to walk with their male friends with their arms around each other s shoulders jesus was love above all divine love in human form could not have been affected by human normshe must have been a man with the purest most genuine behavior something we today have to think hard in order to imagine sadly on the other hand jesus telling off the pharisees is a gut wrenching scene extremely powerful and emotional i even doubt bruce marchiano was acting the sorrow and anger of it after all he s devoted his life to working for god after the making of matthew which forced him to study the bible intensely this movie kept me on the sofa for the entire hours often in tears often with an unbearable feeling of being there then not as a spectator but as a participant for the first time jesus was truly the real focus of the movie and his parables sharp intellect dialectic skill worthy of a great lawyer and teaching with bruce marchiano s excellent delivery became so easily understood no hollywood excesses and distractions here beautiful cinematography incredibly realistic landscapes costumes gorgeous just gorgeous music nothing was missing from this film well the hollywood excess was missing and it was not needed i have no idea why jesus has been portrayed as rather aloof and serious as if always burdened until matthew but i just feel it s been inaccurate jesus was fully a jewish man in his time on earth who laughed and loved and was not ashamed to cry in public as it is documented in the gospels he was dealing with simple uneducated people their following him without food for days to hear him and loving him tells me that he related to them on their level i watch all of the movie or part of it at least once a week and it never gets oldi know from bruce marchiano s website that he wants to fund strictly from donations not banks another word forword movie the gospel according to john and i hope he or rather we accomplishes it soon in fact i can t wait in the years that have passed since matthew his love knowledge and understanding of jesus has grown a lot so i think he ll bring us an even more inspired movie 
timeless classic all the great reviews written previously say it all anne of green gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel i ve been watching this movie since i ve been a child and i still watch it as an adult a movie like this doesn t need special features for it to be attractive as a dvd although the commentary is great just the fact that no matter how long i keep this and how often i watch this movie it won t change like vhs does 
vanishing point great action movie this is one my favorite movies i had it on vhs now on dvd non stop action start to finish with a message 
your mission if you choose to accept it tom cruise s third and his last mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels it works since j j abrahams directed this like man version of alias it works as part of the mission impossible film trilogy lt it works as a taut action adventure thriller it works as a vehicle for tom cruise it is not your father s mission impossible it starts at a point towards the end and works back the amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece the puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwhemingthere are a few missteps in the action and the ploting however cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings i will say phillip seymore hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against cruise s hot and cold action man ving rhames is so under used in mi michelle monaghan is a star who shined as cruise s love interest it is a good action flick for those who crave actionbennet pomerantz audioworld 
the brilliant wonder of catherine keener shines in this pick this is the film that introduced me to the wonderment of catherine keener liv schreiber and anne heche plus it has the ultra cool funny kevin corrigan a film about s somethings and their relationships and what happens when you feel you are losing your best friend to an impending wedding catherine keener plays a neurotic woman who has no idea what she wants out of a relationship so she relies heavily on her best friend heche and her ex boyfriend and male best friend schreiber they are there to comfort her and are outlets to express her doubts on love and life but one of her outlets is about to get married and she has a hard time adjusting to that fact it s a good story about life in your s there is a wonderful appearance by kevin corrigan who just steals most of the scenes he is in it s not over the top acting as you get in your better known dramas and its not just caricatures it s just a little low budget film with some really good acting the right amount of acting that is required for a film of this quality and i found it rather enjoyable 
quinn and hayworth s pasadoble remains one of the movie s best remembered moments the mark of zorro and blood and sand confirmed rouben mamoulian s enduring concern with drama conveyed through movement of characters and camera the former was a rousing deliciously ironic swashbuckler the latter an adaptation of ibaez s story about a simple country boy whose success as a matador leads him into temptation and towards a violent early death rudolph valentino had scored one of his biggest success with blood and sand in and the same story served as a tyrone power vehicle nineteen years later color and mamoulian s almost choreographic direction turned the motion picture into an exquisite melodrama where all the passes and swirls of the bullring were vividly depicted the parade of the bullfighters and their entourage the race of the vicious predator into the arena the matadors flashing their yellow and pink capes rita hayworth blood red lips and scarlet fingernails contrast the cool colors of her spanish mansion and show her off to glittering advantage in her sensuous screen pasadoble with anthony quinn she looks sensational in her rose evening gown symbolic of the spanish bullfight flavor the arrogant and passionate dance based on flamenco dancing that characterizes the man as the matador and the lady as his red cape is performed with style and surety the colors rose and green are blended to perfection with the amazing prowess of an appealing couple in tune with the balanced perfection of shapes and the sweeping movements of rita hayworth quinn is perfect for redoing old valentino roles he always demonstrated his grace and remarkable agility on the dance floor this sequence remains one of the movie s best remembered moments mamoulian begins the film with a minute prologue establishing the characters ten years before the main narrative juanillo just a little boy with fire vigorously illiterate but possessing his father s passion for bullfighting is seen by night currently taking the bullfighting world by storm not least for his exceptional brave and agile style of fighting but also for his age juanillo adores the art of bullfighting hr runs off to madrid with his boyhood friends manolo nacional pablo and la pulga after winning a certain reputation as a flatfooted novillero juan tyrone power returns years later to seville to marry his childhood sweetheart carmen espinosa linda darnell a voluptuous beauty with perfect complexion and brings her to live in his luxurious home where he has installed his mother alla nazimona and his sister encarnacion lynn bari then he goes on to become the first matador in spain showing his individual personality by the combination and variations of his passes juan brings the bull past his body with the elegance of a premier ballet dancer making it seem effortless and beautiful as his popularity climbs juan s entourage of hangers on increases joining his boyhood friends nacional john carradine manolo de palma anthony quinn la pulga michael morris pablo gomez charles stevens sebastian william montague and his loyal dresser garabato j carrol naish who left the ring just as he came in to it without a peseta but all is not so perfect in the ranks of juan s cuadrilla nacional is anxious to leave bullfighting for politics and manolo jealous of juan s success wants to make his own name in the ring and then there is the on going feud juan has been engaging in with natalio curro laird cregar the famous bullfight critic who had insulted the memory of his father when juan established himself as spain s most important matador curro opportunistically affirms at last sevilla has a matador the greatest matador of all history the first man of the world the day he was born there was salt in the air a great quantity of salt and at one of juan s great afternoon we are introduced to the stunning doa sol des muire rita hayworth whose chief passion is bullfighting and in particular handsome matadors the torrid spanish beauty had little difficulty in luring the new risen star away from his home falling under her tempting beauty juan begins an affair with her at the expense of both his faithful wife and his career his skills as a matador go downhill and his bad attitude loses him all his once loyal friends blood and sand is sensitively directed by mamoulian and might be considered one of the greatest examples of technicolor film making the film won an oscar for best color cinematography and was nominated for best interior set decoration 
as good as going to an aa meeting this movie so reminded me of how messy things get when there are booze and pills among other things it perfectly captured what happens to already stroked egos when inhibitions are removed the last scene showing the morning after when the main characters affect a sort of reconciliation after being incredibly nasty to each other the night before is a place i m glad i m don t go to anymore 
interesting movie from the h g wells classic some cool effects again picking this up as a free rental i had little expectations but its not bad alexander hartegen is a profressor of physics at columbia university always busy with work and checking out new technology he has managed by chance to get a woman that he wants to marry although work keeps him tied up much of the time but when he finally pops the question she is taken from him in an accident so using his knowledge he becomes obsessed and achieve building a machine that travels time well the movie takes off from their with a decent story line and some good effects such as jeremy irons as the leader of the underground human species in the end and the moon effects as with many stories often i overthink the movie why did he try only once to change the past before going into the future why not go back a few more times or did he and i missed something or there are a thousand other ways to prevent that first accident why did he do what he did why not come back and take the gun or something anyhow don t overthink it it does have some enjoyable parts and again decent effects and story 
very good light comedy this comedy features cary grant and tony curtis aboard a ww submarine that wasn t really seaworthy but her perpetually optimistic captain cary grant refused to accept that and with the help of a spoiled but cunning requisitions officer tony curtis is able to patch it together and make it useful to the war effort the plot is simple the dialogue isn t complex the acting isn t fantastic but you smile throughout most of this film i believe that was its purpose and it succeeds 
i dust my lemon lies with powder pink and sweet this is an awesome video if you like the cure you will love this video it is full of classic cure songs and is lovely to watch if you get a chance to get this video or even just view it once it is out of print take it 
a movie the movie was very good from start to finish the acting was great and the movie was full of suspense don t let the cheap price fool you it s worth watching 
real people human drama and feelings disregard for stereotypes great photography action with reaction and great lesson in self acceptance is but a few of the elements that makes this a great classic made me think of my social role and position in life just like crash did 
wonderful and romantic disney animation i watched disney s animated the little mermaid in one nasty angry mood within twenty minutes i was feeling happy caught in the spell of a strong story gorgeous animation and lively oscar winning songs the magic of disney for kids of all ages permeates this story of ariel the likeable mermaid who falls in love with a human if she can go without her lovely voice for three days and still get the handsome prince to kiss her she is a human for life the catch is that she can never again see her aquatic friends like her king father and sebastian the hilarious crab comic relief who almost gets eaten ! the central villainess is one of my all time favorites ursula the sea witch evil enough for adults and not too scary for kids she has stolen ariel s lilting voice the story is taken from hans christian andersen but with a downbeat ending radically rethought in disney fashion but i have a hunch the andersen literary circle would approve of the changes in making this a wonderful family film the voice work is perfection including jodi benson as ariel and pat carroll as ursula alan menken and howard ashman collaborated on the songs under the sea won a deserved oscar but i like part of your world and the hilarious kiss the girl also the new double disk dvd of the little mermaid is an absolute must own and not just for families with children if you are a child at heart like me you will treasure it and disney studios has restored the heck out of it the colors are gorgeous the image clarity is flawless and the remastered soundtrack does justice to the music the minute movie is on disk one at its correct moderate wide screen aspect ratio along with an audio commentary should you decide i did not to listen to the co writers and co directors talk about the movie they do enough of that on disk two also on disk one are a trailer for little mermaid iii straight to video probably a wise business decision and a kiss the girl music video there is also a feature that lets you go to a particular song a popular feature on a movie with these songs and an oscar winning music score disk two is mammoth a good three hours i went to bed at midnight with the whole games section untouched there are minutes of deleted scenes with commentary on what we are watching and why they were cut out there is another minutes that goes behind the scenes at disney studios in at a time of great business upheaval to create the mood that this happy and romantic film was made under we also get a nine minute segment on animated special effects like sea storms disney was apparently thinking of doing the little mermaid back in but changed his mind and thankfully made dumbo instead or was it pinocchio the little match girl is a lovely and sad animated short adaptation of another andersen story an exquisite bonus there are also little mermaid art galleries and the original theatrical trailer i still have games and activities to do so i am not sure what to expect i gather that disney was going to do a little mermaid ride at disneyland or disney world but changed their minds there is something called under the sea a virtual ride and a live action segment on life under the sea it s an incredible two disk dvd and i have a hunch it belongs in every household maybe even two copies disney is threatening to put this title back in the vaults for seven more years and your kids may wear out one copy before seven years is up the little mermaid is not quite a walt disney immortal animated classic for me but give it another decade and it might be for the time being it is a fabulous way to spend a long evening with your kids or even alone in a night bedroom 
reciprocity mr hutchins is the key to every relationship anytime i think of this movie i think of this brutally truthful line james cromwell s captain dudley smith is completely convincing as the tough as nails irish cop that did things the old way you can just visualize this huge man cracking heads when he was younger this movie deserves to be placed along side the great noir classics such as chinatown sunset boulevard dark passage and stalag and it was definitely the best movie of 
mouchette the greatest fil of one of the very greatest directors thanks a lot 
thank god for richard egan richard egan makes this film watchable and enjoyable it is an interesting portrayal of this biblical story and as he always did egan shines above all others a good movie for both historical and entertainment value actors of egan s caliber talented charming and handsome are a rare breed in this day and age its too bad 
the storey is far fetched enough to hold your interest no ben hur this isn t but for the length of the movie you are entertained by situational comedy and by some very funny dialogue not for young children though a good cast of stars and supporting actors make this movie one that satisfies 
absolutely riveting no this isn t courtney of friends but once you get past that this is must watch tv ! while the show has content that can be shocking it is so well written and edited it all fits it is definitely a sequential drama and makes much more sense watching the episodes back to back that fleshes out the characters so you start to care about and understand them courtney shows her acting chops best at those moments when she is silent and lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog is a bit stilted the best character is the functional schizophrenic photographer don konkey he is exhibits an endearing combination of weirdness loyalty insight and sweetness to become the break out star of this series if you only watched one episode and wrote this one off go back and watch a few back to back and you may just find yourself addicted 
a charming unconventional comedy you probably won t see a film made in the u s in which a father and daughter are vying for the affections of the same man ! this german film begins with the motley group of zobel played by handsome gotz george one of germanys most popular actors his lover karl christian redi and zobel s daughter lizzie jeanette hain making their living by practicing petty crimes like picking pockets and con schemes when karl is hit by a car during an ill fated scheme zobel and lizzie search for a replacement rudolf a cute yearold gas station attendant fits the bill but complications arise when both lizzie and zobel fall in love with rudolf rudolf returns affections to both of his admirers which of course soon results in numerous conflicts this gritty comedy is infused with charm and pathos both zobel and lizzie are lonely characters seeking a ray of happiness in their dreary lives the film suffers from a weak ending that is not entirely satisfying but the film is one that is definitely recommended 
big low brow laughs this movie is hilarious danny devito is a thug with hollywood dreams and his mob ties make them all come true just imagine the endless possabilities ! absolutely stupid funny 
two great actors in a great movie boys town stars two of the greatest actors of the golden era of hollywood mickey rooney and spencer tracy and their parts in this movie are among their best roles boys town doesn t have quite as close a connection to christmas as the other two titles in the classic holiday collection theres one scene set on the holiday but this true story of a priest who builds a boarding school for troubled youth is one that will warm your heart tracy plays father flanagan a kind socially conscious priest who can be tough when he needs to be and mickey rooney displays his wide ranging acting talent from tough talk to tears as one of the neglected boys whom flanagan sets on the right path boys town is accompanied by its own less famous sequel men of boys town so you re getting two features on one disc you also get a featurette about the real boys town which still exists and has expanded beyond its original nebraska location as well as a radio program promoting the movie with tracy and rooney if you like this great movie you may want to consider getting the excellent classic holiday collection which includes this film along with two other great classics christmas in connecticut and a christmas carol 
spoon the tick kicks ass this is one of the best episodes it s a must have 
there is nothing wrong with the picture quality after reading other reviews that state poor quality transfer i will disagree the video quality on the dvd and vhs is the same as the original broadcast this teleplay was originally recorded on videotape not film early videotape recordings do not have near the quality of film or todays video recordings i do prefer the vhs version over the dvd as the vhs sound is analog since this is a musical i especially do not want the sound ruined by converting it to digital i want to hear all of the great soundtrack as originally recorded 
mis matched friendship enough people have generally explained the plot so i will not suffice it to say this is mischa s best movie and perhaps the best of any actors early performance unfortunately her subsequent major roles are hit andmiss skipped parts being a hit and lost and delirious is to be avoided at all costs sam rockwell was also excellent as trent the friend of mischa s character devonelsewhere i read the one negative review of this movie by someone who seemed upset over nudity and child pornography the fact that mischa is topless for a few seconds and shot from across the street at night and about inches tall on my tv does not quite fit the category of child pornography i do not think unless you are predisposed that way and really really hard up this is a story about a mis matched friendship and all the prejudices that attracts plain and simple great dialog too also ignore the dvd cover it has nothing to do with the movie why the mother takes up half the cover is a mystery she is a minor character the picture of the shirtless man is i think from the photo of his high diving award and the image of devon and trent on the truck actually takes place on a river bank not on a lawn i suppose it is hollywood s influence creeping in fortunately it does not affect the movie 
murder mystery musical women is a good musical murder mystery with humor light heartedness and mystery it combines a bunch of the best french actrices and an enjoyable plot a real guesser until the end 
un box revisited this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i don t see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in mb bites each hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy 
silly title great film andula hana brejchova is a young factory worker who lives in a dorm with other young women in the dreary town of zruc during communist rule in czechoslovakia life is empty and unfulfilling and boys are scarce andula a girl with a sad past of her own that is only hinted at seeks escape from hopelessness in love lest the above description seem too depressing let me add that this film is often very funny particularly in a scene where a trio of middle aged reservists approach andula and her friends at a social mixer director milos forman states in an interview that part of his motivation for making films was in reaction against the absurd socialist realism school of the time which depicted socialist societies as paradises on earth in this seemingly slight film about a young girl s romance he shows much of the unhappiness and hopelessness of such a society while also presenting his characters with great warmth and affection the actors in this film are wonderful and natural with great faces forman observes human behavior very closely and emerges with a story about people with whom everyone can empathize delivering once again the valuable lesson of any great film no matter where or when we were born we are more like each other than unlike 
an older book that is still enjoyable i came across caddie woodlawn as i was making my way through all the old newbery books i was pleasantly surprised at the gentle style of storytelling and the author s knack for telling a good tale the book reminds me a lot of the laura ingalls wilder series both in style and content the author is writing a semi biographical account of her grandmother s life in the end of the th century on the midwestern frontier there are a few tales within the tale that are interesting as well the reader will not be disappointed it is definitely a must have for the young adult library 
tuesdays with morrie it took me all of hours to read this book it was insightful and entertaining it was also sad i cried so hard at the end of the book that i hiccuped for hours i work at a children s home and have passed this book to several of my children who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve i highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face any type of challenge whether mental physical financial whatever 
unique time traveling tale from germany people like me who lived through the fall of the berlin wall but were a little too young at the time to be paying much attention will like this blast to the past much of the wit is summed up in one of the scenes which is only seen in the deleted scenes when the lead character s friend mentions his situation is a little like the delicate situation in back to the future a big hit that was just reaching the eastern bloc at the time the movie is set the tale revolves around a boy who has to keep the past alive for the sake of his mother s health and it illustrates both the excitement of those who experienced the west for the first time and the betrayal in this case felt by his mother of those who upheld the former regime it s a clever look at social change in general and a bit of history that hasn t yet been seen often in film i loved it 
good for the soul i loved this movie i saw it when it first came out and it was such a good feeling movie i never forgot it and i am so happy that i now have it for my own 
scary amp funny in a dark way the acting performance by jennifer tilly was as bizarre and scary as it was funny in a dark way her schizophrenic performance will stay in your mind long after the movie is over it s not an quotaquot class movie but the acting is better than a quotbquot class movie for the price of the dvd when i purchased it i think it was worth it if only to see jennifer tilly in her most bizarre role yet

americana on the plains high energy encapsulation of the american spirit in this tough tender production done lean and hard scrabble as opposed to the lush and green hollywood version curley really is as wonderful as he sings he is aunt eller the matriarch as done by maureen lipman is tough and loving jimmy johnson the welshman jigs and does rope tricks shuler hensley s jud is repulsive and vulnerable a classic for your permanent library 
much ado about the loves of our past some people do make much ado about nothing but maybe that s something maybe that s one thing more than nothing beatrice is the smartest girl in the room any room her trouble is that she loves a defiant bull headed and notorious man from her past and she is betwixt with herself not liking that she has feelings and concern for her gender rival benedick beatrice is good humored disarmingly wickedly tongued and always torn between her loves and her independence benedick is self involved conceited constantly fighting they never meet but there is a skirmish of wit between them beatrice i wonder that you will still be talking senor benedick nobody marks you benedick what my dear lady disdain are you yet living beatrice is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meat food to feed as her senor benedick courtesy herself should convert to disdain if you come in her presence benedick but it is certain that i am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i would that i could find in my heart that i had a hard heart for truly i love none beatrice a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i have my favorite movie lines from this dvd recorded on a minute compilation on my ipod i do this because i m not smart enough to get shakespeare the first time i hear it i listen to them repeatedly not only to try to understand the words but also to understand the intelligence behind how they were so well acted by branagh and thompson this shakespearean play succeeds or fails in the casting of beatrice and in this version emma thompson plays beatrice divinely at a turning point in the movie don pedro played capably by denzel washingion visits with a pensive beatrice beatrice is discussing with don pedro her past trials with benedick don pedro you have put him down lady you have put him down beatrice so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools don pedro will you have me lady beatrice carefully no my lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear everyday but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter don pedro your silence most offends me and to merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour beatrice no ! sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born benedick later sililoquys that he will not marry until he finds all positive attributes he seeks in only one woman smart women tend to be able to recognize gifted men and women who cross their path fortunately most beatrices encounter a few benedicks beatrices in their travels and vice versa in a final scene benedick asks beatrice then you do not love me beatrice replies no truly ! but in friendly recompense there are more good reasons than i can understand why shakespeare s ideas withstand the tests of time this film version is so very very good as with most shakespearean comedies and tragedies the plots hinge on several key misunderstandings in his romantic tragedies the misunderstandings such as romeo juliet are not discovered until too late in the comedies the misunderstandings are discovered in time 
my man dr smith is a riot in this episode dr smith and the robot go hog wild switching personalities and swapping insults this is a great episode

very close after watching this video i examined the bible and it is very close to the scriptures in accuracy it helps give the bible life so that you can see the reality of creation and vividly picture these true events that occured thousands of years ago in our history this is truly a video the whole family can enjoy together 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version 
worth waiting for i had heard of the shop on main street years ago but never had the chance to see it until tonight i even bought and read the book by ladislaw grosman years ago in anticipation of seeing the movie some day i must admit that the book was impressive but not that impressive and so i worried that the movie might be anticlimatical it wasn t the book was a long short story a novella if you will it laid out the story clearly enough but it was the movie that brought all of the characters to life and created the gradual development of the impending crisis by the time we reached that crisis we had met a few jerks and unimpressive characters however we had also come to know and appreciate a number of people that we found endearing for different reasons as events darken the scene we suspect something bad is about to happen i knew what it was going to be but it still had an impact for me the two main characters in the shop on main street are an elderly jewish woman played outstandingly by ida kaminska and a neer dowell slovakian carpenter played impressively by josef kraner the way these two come to interact with each other and the ebb and flo of their relationship is the heart of the movie the picture gives a personal look at the final solution as it is played out in a small czech village the emotions that the director brings out on film is where the movie soars above the book watching the shop on main street is a moving experience it challenges us and leaves us wondering where we would have fit into this cast of characters in doing so we may come to have a slightly better understanding of the incomprehensible that oxymoron is worth the two hours spent watching the shop on main street the raw emotions on display will stay with you long after 
van damme still has it this film though not a hit proved to people that van damme was back in shape and could still the van damme thing which is kick people s asses i know this was not his best acting but it was a pretty entertaning flick i really wish it had more success at the box office i mean come on it wasnt meant to be an oscar winner its an action flick that has plenty of action nuff said 
one of those movies that should never be re made well finally this is on dvd like miracle on th st christmas carol etc this movie has one definitive version and should never have been touched again wallace beery is long john silver for anyone else to play his part should condemn them to the lower reaches where they have to watch green acres re runs for eternity the very idea makes me physically ill jackie cooper s role here is absolutely brilliant upon my soul ! and the movie itself is really quite well done very exciting and interesting well acted in all the parts but matey when it comes to parrots perching on shoulders the digital wallace beery will live forever an essential movie probably top all time 
king of the wild frontier walt disney made five television shows about davy crockett with fess parker in the title role and buddy ebsen as his sidekick george russel you can now own all five of these television shows in two versions this version presents all five television shows as they were first presented on abc in the mid s there is also a two movie version that combines these five television shows into two movies i personally prefer the disney treasures version this version also includes additional material that may be interesting to a fan of the series the gem of the additional material is the interview with fess parker the television shows in this set are diverse in style the first three television episodes are davy crockett indian fighter davy crockett goes to congress and davy crockett at the alamo these television shows have some basis in historical fact though many of the things portrayed in these shows are wrong for example davy left the rifle he called betsy back in tennessee when he went to texas what is amazing about these television shows is the response of americans suddenly children everywhere were sporting coonskin caps and carrying replicas of muzzle loading rifles it became unfashionable to be a native american and very fashionable to say bar instead of bear though davy did not survive the events at the alamo davy s popularity was such that walt disney brought davy back in two additional television adventures davy crockett and the keelboat race and davy crockett and the river pirates according to walt disney this second set of adventures was based on stories created about davy crockett who had become a legend in his own time the stories were more humorous than the first three and showed an even larger thanlife version of davy crockett than the first three adventures what is most remarkable about these television shows is how well they hold up the story of davy crockett is timeless davy s attributes are those that form the basis of how americans see themselves self reliance honesty keeping your word and being plain spoken remain characteristics that most americans value a viewer does have to forgive several things that we now regard as politically incorrect particularly in the first part of the first movie where davy seems to have little regard for native americans however in later episodes davy clearly values his friendship with native americans and attempts to honor the commitments the u s government made to them i allowed my children to watch these movies when they were very young yes there is some violence in these movies however davy and george russel used violence only when there appeared to be no other reasonable way out given that the era depicted in these movies was violent i think the movies were directed and produced well these movies are a great way to introduce your children to an era when the american ethic for honesty hard work and trust were formulated davy crockett was instrumental is being an example we can all follow perhaps now more than ever this movie is a must for every family film library enjoy !

probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
you will either love it or hate it people who watch this movie either love it or hate it 
good wayne and holden film decent civil war film of supposedly true event wayne and holden s characters well drawn wayne the troop leader and holden his regimental surgeon clash over appropriate treatment of the soldiers under wayne s command story drags a bit from time to time but generally enjoyable romance is a bit far fetched but hey this s a wayne western so not a lot of time spent on that story is that wayne made this film in part to finance his project that was in preliminary production the alamo good transfer to dvd and horses going across wooden bridge will give your surround speakers a work out 
civilization is like a thin layer of ice upon a deep ocean of chaos and darkness werner herzog this comment may contain spoilers aguirre the wrath of god is a fascinating tale that was told by its matchless team of creators two madmen not unlike aguirre himself full of powerful images of impressive landscapes and natural wonders this film as many of herzog s films explores his favorite theme magnificent indifference of nature against the man s obsession that borders with madness one of the best endings ever tragic and comical in the same time mad and delusional man on the wrecked raft with the monkeys and he does not see it he lives in his own world that he created in his feverish mind when i watch herzog s films i think of his words if i had to climb into hell and wrestle the devil himself for one of my films i would do it each his film deserves to be wrestled for 
a fine tune indeed a great opportunity to see two of the worlds finest actors toe to toe in this gritty drama about the army in post war britain mill s portrayal of stiff upper lip barrow and guinness s jock sinclair is a masterpiece the resentment of the two officers to each other grows until the climax of the film spoiler belowthe most saddest moment is guinness at the end supported by some his his fellow officers after breaking down following his animated version of the funeral procession that will take place 
great acting by hollywood s most underated actress i saw this movie without really knowing what it was about and was completely suprised by how good it is diane lane who is not only beautiful but talented plays a yuppie housewife who is given a gun by her husband after she gets her neighbor involved james legros they embark on series of strange and mysterious events this movie won best picture at the sundance film festival in and is worth renting but don t buy unless it s under diane lane is truly underated in hollywood and quotmy new gun quot proves why 
daniel deronda a prince among men wow if the ratings could go higher than stars i d sure give it at least a the actor who plays daniel deronda couldn t have been chosen any better and the selection of romola garai to portray the beautiful but selfish mrs grandcourt was equally rich what makes this movie so memorable and endearing is the theme you have two beautiful very beautiful and talented girls vying for the heart of one man of course this is every man s dream but where it gets really good is the humbling process that mrs grandcourt must go through in order to see what kind of woman she was at the end through great pain and self discovery of her inner selfishness she is finally fit to become someone s excellent wife she pines away the hours and for days on end for the chance to become daniel s wife but during this humbing and transformation of the most beautiful romola garai daniel is falling in love with another girl whom he rescued from a watery grave daniel was an english gentleman with manners courtesy love and caring for those he knew as daniel was slowly discovering his jewish roots through the girl whose life he saved he began to fall in love with her not only for her beauty but her commitment to god through judaism and her angelic voice she was very talented and nice to look at but it was her singing voice and dedication to god is what attracted daniel to her towards the end daniel became more involved is his new found jewish family and began identifing with them the scenery of the film switched back and forth from england to italy and the twist at the end with daniel s mother emerging from a life long silence added to the excitment and plot as daniel finally proposed to this beautiful jewess it was followed by a jewish wedding ceremony with jewish wedding music it was so good to see a film that included the richness of the jewish traditions and religion without apology and now at the end of the story where both beauties wanted daniel deronda only one of them won the prize on the one hand this story is every guys dream a well mannered rich guy who is handsome and desired by all the ladies and on the other hand they both can t have him and it leaves your heart broken for the beautiful mrs grandcourt the picture on the cover of the dvd is really a prophetic look at the whole thing it s a wonderful show and real treat for guys 
great story great movie i ve never seen the original time machine versions before but i absolutely loved this movie i am of course a big fan of special effects but the story is fascinating ! i ve watched the movie several times and every single time i m blown away the story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds you ll continue to wonder where the story will end up if you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel then add this movie to your collection ! 
pretty good despite cheesy title it s the ussr has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the east coast of the united states for the purpose of brinksmanship but hold on there is a problem the soviet union is staffed with incompetents one of communism s most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel the menacing black submarine is doomed from the get go it leaks and it is cobbled together with substandard parts after heading out to sea there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits the men receive lethal doses of radiation but unfortunately the doctor doesn t know anything about radiation sickness he is only giving them aspirin before long radiation begins to permeate the ship the entire crew is in danger the officers are of two minds some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the americans while others want to save face for the soviet union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die as the submarine becomes more and more disabled as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby american destroyer as the submarines s food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat the dread of the crew is really palpable this movie was very suspenseful because i had no idea how it would end definitely worth your time 
loneliness can be very dangerous nobody knows what to make of may angela bettis born with a lazy eye for which she wore a patch while growing up she became a loner oddball whose only friend was a perfectly kept doll she moves to l a and takes up with a filmmaker jeremy sisto but the relationship sours quickly and dangerously she then befriends an alluring lesbian colleague anna faris but that too along with every connection may attempts to make turns deadly i found may accidentally one day while surfing the web there were several very positive reviews and as i am always open to discovering new independent films i rented it as soon as possible may is the story of a girl who is born with a lazy eye and becomes very socially isolated as a result her only true friend is a doll enclosed in glass that she can never touch the movie focuses on how may as an adult has reached the brink she is either going to begin to learn to make friends and interact with people normally or not the movie is hip deep in imagery and metaphors most of which are fairly disturbing may s attempts to interact with people will make you cringe with embarassment many of the scenes are very bloody and the movie climaxes with some fairly graphic violence but it s the more subtle imagery primarily focusing on may s doll that really set the creepy uncomfortable tone you can t believe something like this could ever happen but on the other hand you almost can the underlying idea is a fairly common and basic one the desire to make a connection with another human being may takes that promise and puts a new disturbing and fascinating spin on it if you are not able to handle graphic and disturbing images may is not for you if you like unique disturbing intelligently made movies that actually make you think then you will love this film absolutely one of the best movies i have seen in years i immediately bought a copy after watching it and i can t give a much better review than that my only complaint with the dvd is a lack of a making of segment i would have loved a behind thescenes loo 
another good csi ny though csi ny is most least favorite of the three csis they still manage to make a good one sometimes this is one of those good ones 
this is their best picture together with fred and ginger joined by george and ira this is their best picture together we begin in paris where fred is petrov the russian ballet dancer who is really peter p peters of philadelphia pa ginger is laura keen american musical dancing star they meet because fred has seen her picture and fallen in love with her he calls but at that moment ginger has had her fill of adoring male fans and it doesn t help matters that pete puts on a fake russian accent i must go to moscow and manages to so disorient ginger that she packs her bags and sets sail for america edward everett horton who is fred s perfect comedic foil here as in others of their films plays the ballet impresario jeffery baird dithering and droll as ever he and fred book on the same ship as ginger the queen anne a deco delight of the seas with teardrop shaped windows and other streamlining that would make the normandie and isle de france blush after a gangway encounter that does not go terribly well fred tries to make amends at first ginger is icy but as always she begins to melt for a time however fred more or less disappears and is awol from ballet rehearsals that is because he loves modern music and to prove it we get slap that bass one of fred s very best solo numbers as he picks up the rhythms of the black combo and combines it with the sounds of the ship s engines to create what is a look ma no hands kind of a tour de force tap dancing solo also on board a lot of zaniness occurs as fred along with ginger s manger named arthur miller played by jerome cowan in one of his best rolls fool horton into thinking in one scene that he is seasick and in another that the ship is on fire and in danger of sinking both are hilarious back to the wooing there was never such sophisticated courting music as george s captivating walking the dog except perhaps for the similarly engaging incidental music by the pool in the philadelphia story fred woos ginger by endearing himself to a passel of pooches and her little dog too once he knows and she knows that they have fallen for one another he sings the marvelous beginners luck at the ship s rail this is one of several moments in the film where they do not feel that they have to go into their dance in order to convey the meaning of the song and it is a great introduction to one of the many gershwin standards they introduce in this picture confusion is rife however due to a ruse that horton created to get a designing woman former ballet dancer denise aka lady tarrington off fred s trail horton has said that fred is married and lady t being a loose lipped kind of a gal buys the story and spreads the word everyone on two continents and on the liner jump to the not unlikely conclusion that the wife in question is miss keen when word leaks out ginger leaves in a hurry taking off in the mail plane catapulted from the deck of the liner way to travel stateside horton and eric blore as the hotel manager get into a mistaken identity bit of dialogue that is priceless soon ginger introduces the wonderful they all laughed wearing the only flawed gown in the film what we here at home call the amoeba dress she thinks she is done but fred leaps up and tells the crowded night club that now he and she are going to dance together for the first time in public here is one of their make it up as we go numbers and from ginger s first timid twist onward it works beautifully they combine fred s ballet steps with ginger s broadway hoofing and it all blends like a good cocktail one wishes that ginger had switched out the wardrobe however and worn the fringed gold lame dress she had on in paris more confusion ensues poor hotel manager blore keeps changing the locks on fred and ginger s adjoining suites as he wails mrs petrov are you miss keen miss keen are you mrs petrov hiding out from the paparazzi ginger and fred make for central park where they engage in the latest craze of roller skating to the witty and unforgettable po taytoe pa tahtoe song lets call the whole thing off this kind of dance novelty was one of fred s fortes and they both are wonders on wheels in order to be able to stop the rumors they decided to get married in order to get divorced to prove that they aren t married this is after all a screwball comedy so they go to new jersey to wed where fred asks what the grounds are for divorce in this state and the justice of the peace answers marriage on the way home on the ferry they get out of their marvelous car and fred sings the lovely they can t take that away from me ginger s eyes well with tears and we know that they are both deeply in love even as they are going ahead with their plan to divorce papers need to be served and this winds blore in jail where one of the funniest comic bits ever filmed occurs between him and horton its appeal rivals the famous whose on first the whole cast assembles for a review in which ginger is not to appear so fred dances with harriet hocker who is flexible indeed while the rest of them engage in a shushing contest with the audience ginger is reunited with fred when she sees that since he cannot dance with her he is dancing with scores of girls with ginger masks the set is great lots of mirrors that open and close and a lot of business with the masks until fred finds the one and only dancer who is really ginger all of this to the peppy shall we dance fred and ginger have the last laugh and keep us smiling too yes friends this is another rko radio picture

much cooler than i expected this is a surprisingly good show it manages to have a little violence sex and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid and it s still intelligent enough to be interesting humorous and kind of addicting to an adult a modern nancy drew is veronica mars i wish seasons and were here i wish anything more were here and i d get that as well i m really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season just for kicks i m glad i did

a simple plan a twisted movie two brothers and a friend stumble across a crashed airplane full of cash million dollars to be precise in the snowy woods our wise hero played by bill paxton devises a simple plan in which they can lay low with the cash to determine if anyone is looking for it then move out of town and split the bounty if only he could control everything the bag o cash is just a starting point for this riveting morality tale the bottom line is that one lie always leads to another and our little trio plus the wives get in deeper and deeper there are bound to be crossed loyalties in a group of three the brothers have family ties and the friend is loyal to only one of the brothers the billy bob thornton character a push andpull over the loyalty of thornton s character ensues each man has different family and work pressures and not all are as patient as the one who devised the clear headed simple plan it s captivating to watch money change the motives and behaviors of these men the real star is billy bob thornton playing the down andout loser jacob he s a nobody in town a generally recognized screw up but he is truly the philosopher of the group he has very simple desires of resurrecting his dead father s farm and he can t imagine taking the cash and leaving the only town he s ever known in the end he plays the only man with a conscience my chief complaint with both the movie and the novel of the same name is the way the sarah character goes through a complete personality change she s two completely different people at different points in the movie and her change in behavior isn t well explained all other characters however are exceptionally well developed

no viva when you leave las vegas leaving las vegas was released in which was many moons ago i can recall seeing the pm showing with two of my friends we decided we wanted to go to the movies and out of the choices at the theater in question we went to see leaving las vegas i recall it being very cold outside that night the weather that evening would later play a part in our souls once the movie was over the three of us were speechless some good adjectives to describe our mood after witnessing leaving las vegas morose forlorn detached and just plain sad the only thing to lift our spirits was a middle of the night visit to denny s for some greasy food now i haven t seen this movie since until the other night i watched it with the approach that the movie might not seem quite as sullen as it did oh so many years ago however the motion picture was still deep and dejecting as for the movie itself leaving las vegas is wonderful piece of cinema a dark and depressing drama that at times haunts the viewer but nevertheless a remarkable movie as for the acting well it is top notch this is the last great movie nicolas cage has made except maybe face off some of his recent roles are real laughing stocks i e national treasure and gone in sixty seconds elizabeth shue s acting was also very good a big leap from adventures in babysitting and the karate kid i also enjoyed julian warlock sands as the latvian pimp and why richard lewis was in this movie puzzles me as much as who s the inspiration for the mona lisa now this movie does have its flaws i find it interesting that shue s character was ravishing sophisticated unpolluted insightful and moral for a prostitute if you can show me a call girl with those traits then every red cent i earn will go towards the institute that is prostitution and julia roberts in pretty woman doesn t count the events that transpire to shue in the film along with her relationship with cage s character and her reminiscing with the unnamed individual through out the film screams post traumatic stress disorder however i have never seen an individual with ptsd be as pseudo jovial as shue s character is in this movie therefore if you are looking for restitution of the human condition this might or might not be the movie for you though if you want to see nick cage drinking his soul out and liz shue a call girl with a heart then this absolutely is the movie for you i did find an interesting conduit with this movie it is the unofficial sequel to city of angels it might sound silly but watch city of angels and follow nicolas cage s character in that movie until the end credits once city of angels is over it seems pretty easy for cage s character to continue into leaving las vegas without giving too much information about either movie cage s characters can blend into one and other the key to this trick is too look at the obvious dichotomy among characters when watching both movies i guarantee you will get it so if you have nothing better to do on a sunday afternoon watch city of angels and then leaving las vegas you might be disappointed but not surprised i digress to that cold night in when the mood of the chilly weather suited the deflated spirits of my friends and i after we left the theater it almost appeared that the movie produced the cold and aloof temperature outside that night who knows maybe it really wasn t that frosty out but our composure after watching this emotional roller coaster made it seem colder that it actually was which is the feeling leaving las vegas left for three young men that night it made us dismal and somber with the only fix being greasy food just as nicolas cage s character only fix towards his gloomy and tragic life was alcohol told you the temperature had a frame of reference 
an uplifting album another one of commissioned s masterpieces my husband and i love this cd and are usually fighting over who gets to listen to it my husband s favorite song is quotim learning quot one of my favorite songs and i have a whole lot of them is quotwe shall behold him quot of course it talks about the rapture and meeting the saviour in the air i am anticipating for his return ! just to see him face to face would be so awesome ! 
a journey into a dark and complex mind i really hope this film gets released on dvd sometime soon as it is truly a rare and extraordinary find a brilliant artistic acheivement for those whose tastes run deeper than the mainstream and who may have a more than casual interest in world war in general and adolph hitler in particular or the very mysterious nature of evil itself this film is a definate must see the premise portrayal and characterization indeed evoke the sense of a desolate self absorbed soul whose only possible source of comfort in an eternity of self reflection would be the constant reinforcement of his own pathological lies to any one who would still be foolish or gullible enough to listen a soul unable to face ultimate truth the realization of which could only equal pitiful agony and hopeless despair 
horrific and awesome action movie with heart and rage years before moviemakers really starting getting comic book adaptations right with films like spiderman and batman begins came darkman a brilliant action horror movie that came closer than any show before it to capturing the darker more developed comics of the modern era it s a gory and action packed and intelligent emotional and quite often humorous tale as peyton westlake superbly played by liam neeson becomes the darkman after barely surviving an attack by mob thugs employed by the crimelord durant larry drake who westlake s attorney girlfriend julie frances mcdormand is trying to bring down a scientist researching the development of a perfect synthetic skin to aid burn victims it s being immersed in this liquid in its unstable corrosive state and then left for dead following the explosive destruction of his lab that is largely responsible for westlake s metamorphis into darkman unable to feel physical pain but constantly assailed by emotional and mental anguish enhanced strength due to the maximum adrenaline now coursing unchecked through his system constantly hours a day serious rage problems severely altered scarred physical appearance westlake darkman can create perfect masks of any human being and mimic their vocal patterns precisely but the masks break down after a finite period in sunlight and thus he most frequently appears in his new identity s trademark garb of bandages and black trenchcoat and hat i realize typing that that it sounds like a dopey outfit but it s actually a striking and intimidating look onscreen thanks to the great effects and costuming hellbent on a path of revenge against drake s crime empire and on protecting his love julie from the shadows the violent and vengeful reign of the darkman begins a movie that possibly could only have been made by a man capable of directing such diverse films as the spiderman epics the evil dead trilogy and the gift highest recommendation 
one of the best new firm videos i fully enjoyed this tape from even the first time doing it which i m usually a little paranoid about it s one of the only videos that wears you out but leaves you feeling good about your workout it s composed of fun dance steps lots of jumping that ll leave your legs feeling like noodles and some great abs for isolating your obliques the instructor is incredibly motivating and you really feel she s having sympathy for you ! she keeps smiling even though you know she s dying and i like her catch phrase quotmind over the muscle quot as she does her millionth squat buy this video if you want a hyper paced fun and quick workout that ll leave you feeling as if you ve spent hours at the gym i know i love it
