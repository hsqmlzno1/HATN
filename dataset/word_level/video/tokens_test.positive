brilliant ! so good you should not buy this dvd this is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker storyteller dark moody exciting and fast ! thx is an amazing example of style and substance so whatever you do don t buy this dvd instead spend just a few bucks more and get the dvd version which delves into the making of the film the early days of lucas and coppola walter murch s involvement and the whole story about american zoetrope it also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor s getting their heads shaved all in all it is a spectacular dvd set and worth the extra few dollars the dvd version also has a much better cover 
time cannot erode an assault for certain and all the more nefarious due to its artistic merit before going any further to address this edition specifically i have to say that it greatly enhances the film it has an optional professor s narrative which can be enabled to play along as one watches i know a considerable amount about the era but found that i learned much from listening in to his lecture there are two important justifications for valuing triumph of the will first even though it is contrived and propagandistic we are privy to a primary source document from the period which historically speaking is an end in itself the nazis were human beings all bethey particularly evil ones men for the most part as opposed to goblins or orcs we see this clearly with himmler who appears to be the only one in ss uniform that cannot goosestep and also in the awkward interaction between herr reichsfeuhrer and his master upon the podium they don t know whether to shake hands or continue to jut their arms out erectly triumph reveals perhaps unintentionally much that cannot be described by narrative or second hand account a second reason to see and preserve this documentary is that it makes us more grateful for the democracies in which we live through these planned shots and compulsively rehearsed movements we can feel what it must have been like to have had the misfortune to live within the pincer prongs of a totalitarian state when confronted by this picturesque masterpiece we feel a sympathy for the germans that was not possible years ago for them there was no cnn or bbc or fox news there was only dr goebbels and the projects and information he approved or fabricated no way of hearing the truth was possible unless they risked their lives to come across it life under the nazis was as communitarian as could be and that as an american is what i found most repellent being submerged within a uniformed mass of citizens is something our founders would have never tolerated and thank god for that ! a life of conformity and ritual is not a life at all having to line up like the workers and youth here to listen to blowhards bellow was certainly an underrated barbarism of that time only the nazis could have turned nuremberg party day into a week s worth of activities this is a living dedication to narcissistic leadership and the victory of self adulation over reason this society was so militarized that even the men of the national labor service wielded their spades as if they were rifles hitler appears often before us and is presented in his best light yet one can sense his detachment and note his manners which are more studied than real he peers out from hotels and airplanes with a benevolent expression while never remotely caring about the people he is supposed to guarding yes this movie is very slanted but all the horror you need to see remains visible

that justice that should be for all this film is a true story it is important for you to know that because some of the facts and reactions seem excessive and yet it all starts with a bunch of rowdy black kids who run across an older white man a local personality who starts playing with these boys of ten or eleven and these boys decide to fight against it probably without knowing what they were fighting against except that it was not correct to let an older white man touch you if you were a little black boy local police and justice officials will go along a road that leads the same boy who is arrested for molesting the older man to a triple death sentence for a triple murder that he never committed and that will never be investigated properly the film is absolutely outstanding because it sets the emphasis on this black man an ex world champion in boxing transcending this fate and getting so high in his meditation that he is truly free in prison and truly divine in his mind this hurricane thus set as an example and model to anyone whose freedom is endangered we can move to the year old black boy from brooklyn who buys and reads rubin carter s book in a booksale for cents his own life is a series of accidental cicumstances that lead him from deprevation among alcoholics to some achievement in a host family in canada this black boy lesra identifies with rubin and gets involved in his case his canadian guardians get along with this involvement and they will eventually bring the truth out and convince a federal court that the man is innocent and has to be released from prison immediately what is important here is how these people react and organize their search and how it succeeds thanks to some nearly immaterial circumstances that go their way and not the simple automatic and habitual way it is such cases that justify people in thinking there is hope in our societies where the poor cannot have any justice at all because they cannot afford good lawyers from the very start and later on it is too late the initial damage can rarely be redeemed and yet some cases are there to prove it could even if it does not most of the time this is one of the films that should be studied in details in all high schools all over the world dr jacques coulardeau university of paris dauphine university of paris i pantheon sorbonne 
they can t take that away from me the beloved shall we dance was the only fred and ginger film with songs from george and ira gershwin and they were splendid songs like they can t take that away from me made for great entertainment when coupled with the opulent rko sets in this pandro s berman production the lively tale of mix ups and misunderstandings was from a screenplay by allan scott and ernest pagno based on an adaptation by p j wolfson of a story by lee loeb and harold buchman ginger s gowns by irene were fabulous as always and mark sandrich once again took the helm on his stay in paris pete fred astaire a famous ballet dancer also known as petrov wants to meet musical comedy star linda keene ginger rogers and in fact would like to marry her ! pete and his pal jeffrey edward everett horton discover she s sailing on the s s queen anne and follow her pete uses a fake accent for a short time but is eventually found out and finds out that dogs are the way to a girl s heart a wild story jeffery told lady tarrington ketti gallian in paris comes back to haunt pete as suddenly everyone on the cruise thinks he and linda have been secretly married and are going to have a baby ! it s a bit much for linda who has sworn off reporters and they decide to really get married so they can get divorced but it s too late for linda as she has fallen in love with the pursuing pete and there is a sadness as pete sings they can t take that away from me on a ferry to manhattan after it s all done the tune was nominated as best song but lost the oscar to sweet leilani from waikiki wedding hilarious moments in the film include edward everett horton and eric blore in a hushing duel with ballet patrons horton and jerome cowan getting tight with horton getting ill afterward and fred convincing horton that he s seasick even though the water is perfectly calm blore ends up in jail for the second time in one of the couple s pictures and is once again a riot ginger sings they all laughed and she and fred share a lovely dance that culminates with a smile as the couple sit on a piano a fun and famous scene has them on skates in the park dancing to lets call the whole thing off fred s character pete wants to dance with linda all his life but what s he to do when she won t consider it dance with images of her that s what a charming conclusion has linda joining the other girls but pete can t figure out which is the real linda will linda say yes to pete if you are a fan of fred astaire and ginger rogers you know the answer to that one devoted fans of one of the most fondly remembered couples in screen history might be shocked to learn that during production there were plans for this to be their final film swing time their previous entry now widely regarded by film historians along with top hat as the zenith of their films together had done huge box office business in large cities upon its initial release but that business had quickly subsided and there were those at rko who felt they had gone to the well once too often fortunately for us that theory was squashed and we got to see the hilarious carefree and the tender the story of vernon and irene castle before the couple said farewell again fortunately we don t have to say farewell only see you later because we now have the ability to watch these wonderful films at home whenever we want shall we dance is a charming reminder of a magic that passed this way only once and something you ll want to capture forever by picking up a copy today 
we all travel that road this review may contain spoilers ! this film is incredibly moving disturbing and heart breaking the pathos may be matched by a small handful of films but i cannot for the life of me think of one single film that tops it it beautifully illustrates the story of a sincere yet simple minded burly man who knows that he seeks love but does not have the sophistication to express it in words so finds his only recourse is to lash out it seems at the woman he loves he lashes out more at his own ineffectuality but does not know that himself the pathos comes in because love is so new and unfamiliar that it makes him feel vulnerable which is very frightening to his sense of masculinity this film is operating on so many levels at once that it must be viewed at least or times to dredge all the gold from the many layered conflicts going on with all of the main characters the death of the fool is so unexpected by zampano if no one else that he finds himself trapped in the consequences of an unintended act meted out he felt to level justice as he saw it as a witness to his crime and with her inability to move through what has occurred and go on it causes gelsomina to constantly remind zampano what he has done this plus he must see how his actions have not only ended one life but is slowly but surely destroying the bright light of joy which once existed in the one he loves until the only way he can end the pain of the truth as he sees it is to abandon the best thing in his unrewarding life when he hears the familiar song that gelsomina used to play on her trumpet being hummed by a woman hanging the laundry and so inquires only to find out that she died of exposure with a broken heart due to his leaving her in the final scene it all comes home as he realises he had the brass ring and didn t even know it and as he lets out his doleful cry on the beach at night we feel his pain right along with him as though we too have lost something very dear the way fellini stalled the realization to the very end whether intended or not so pulled the rug out from under me that i actually bawled like a baby for minutes at the end of the movie and felt so helpless that the only thing i felt i could do to come out of the morass i had fallen into was to hug my wife for dear life and pray to god that i would never lose sight of the treasures in my own life while foolishly chasing some rainbow or worrying about maintaining an image at the expense of everything that gives that image its substance this film has the ability if one is ready for it to change your life ! bravo fellini 
fabulous i am a big micky rourke fan any way this movie just does something for me it isn t for everyone if sexual content movies bother you this movie definitely is not for you 
awesome s sci fi this is one of the best sci fi films from the snot to be missed 
much better than i expected i avoided this movie when it was released because i couldn t imagine that a film based on the marital breakup of nora ephron and carl bernstein would interest me although i am an admirer of both these folks for their talents as writers i had always agreed with richard burton when he said when asked if he would be writing about his marriage and breakup with elizabeth taylor that even though love might be dead that it wasn t for sale be that as it may this movie is certainly worth seeing although the plot is a little thin there are some very funny moments whether some of the events actually happened in the bernstein ephron saga doesn t matter any film directed by mike nichols starring meryl streep and jack nicholson with cinematography by nestor amendros is well worth seeing both ms ephron and the viewer have the last laugh 
immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods 
downloading is easy csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i ve only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it s certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great

holy like the review i just read tarkovskies andre rublev is the movie that i keep coming back to over the years it is my favorite film and has been until something as special comes along more than any filmmaker in any country in any language this movie has imparted and impressed it s viewpoint into my perception i have incorporated it into my vision i resonate with it it plays me like a bell it is not an entertainment really though much of it is entertaining this film transcends both entertainment and mere artistic success the images and themes are so spiritually charged and archetypically strong that one may have the sense while watching it that he or she is remembering half forgotten dreams like the person whose review i just read i often pause in simple wonder after a chapter just to let it ring the film chronicles the life and spiritual development of russian artist icon painterandre rublev the epic unfolds in chapters the last of which introduces another artist a young church bell maker the chapter reveals aspects and components of the creative process both literally and in allegory one senses that the filmmaker tarkovsy and the young bell maker may have a great deal in common and that he may have written himself into this section this last chapter spring is shot through with a narrative vitality an energetic quality to the expression that is simply colossal there is a joy in the unfolding and discovery of this bell makers own creative powers all of which is witnessed by the aging jaded andre rublev who is as a witness transformed by what he sees as will be anyone who has eyes to see and apprehend the naked wonder of this last chapter andre tarkovsky made this film in what used to be the ussr during a period of rigid and scrutinizing censorship he used the artistic restraints and the hoops he had to jump through to a brilliant advantage carefully codifying individual artistic and spiritual themes into the chapters of this epic the constraints seem to have served to discipline and streamline the narrative the result is golden more truth per foot of film than any i can compare it to i saw it first on video in college in a russian art history class later bought the dvd and more recently attended a screening at disney studios that colleague was given the invite to but couldn t make i brought someone who just didn t get it tarkovsy is not for everyone though you should give yourself the benefit of the doubt because if he is for you you may very well be changed and touched and rewarded again and again by this truly timeless gem 
a western classic i remember this movie when it came to the theaters i was just a kid at that time when roy rogers gene autry all of the other cowboy idols were still popular it is definitely a classic among the westerns if you enjoy westerns collect the movies this one should be part of your collection also westerns in color were a premium treat back then 
disturbing and real this movie will stay with you for a long while whether you want to remember the images or not it tells the story of the underbelly of small town america poor and uneducated people like stevie who fall through the cracks of the social system and end up in jail for pedophilia you do not know whether to feel pity for stevie or disgust generally you feel both i did find that the film maker attempted to establish some kind of bond with stevie throughout the film but that there was in fact no bond scenes with the film maker steve were flat and boring sometimes you could sense stifled hostility in his demeanor with the film s subject stevie not exactly a big brother relationship given the horrible facts of stevie s current crime the most amazing scene happens early on when the film maker s young son encounters stevie and is led out of the room by his father with a look of pure terror on his face wow kids sense danger 
combat war movie it was interesting seeing henry fonda in immortal sergeant he was young when he played the part of this combat soldier in this movie i know years later he played in other war movies like battle of the bulge and midway 
this is an excellent workout it was my first firm workout and has been my springboard and the one i come back to since i bought it in tracie long is such an excellent enthusiastic instructor and she was so gracious to me as i was babbling that to her on the fitprime website that i still cant help talking her up good luck to her and the fitprime series as i read on this site sounds like another wonderful workout that i do intend to add to my collection at some point the other firm videos the tortoise and the hare and all weights workouts are excellent 
it has become a cult classic the misfits of hollywood and the critics panned kevin costner s waterworld however it has become a cult classic and it will continue to be one of the most memorable films of cinema history it is movie making at its original best and truly innovative those who panned it were ignorant and did not understand its reach in every scene there is something new and barriers broken and after all that is what great films are all about the misfits of hollywood have as much credibility worldwide as stalin or hitler and they will never define the significance of waterworld each person who views the film will give new meaning to it both kevin costner and dennis hopper are terrific as they have been in so many other films the sheer logistics of making it in the waters off hawaii were monumental 
the modern animal farm george orwell s animal farm has been looked upon as one of the best novels in the th century through talking animals the storyline cleverly introduces orwell s bitterness towards communism under stalin s rule the entire setting takes place on a european pasture accompanied with the talking farm animals and very few humans due to modern technological advances in movie production the realism of the farm animals was greatly affected director john stephenson makes it very clear that all of the animals are mistreated and neglected by their alcoholic owner mr jones since the animals were not cared for by their owner they decided to start a revolution that would set themselves free from all human rule the animals rallied and soon were in complete self control and free from any higher power shortly after the breakaway there is a government issue in their animalism rule the appointed leader snowball is overtaken by napoleon stalin napoleon only cares about one thing during his communist rule and that is being completely in control of everyone he violates all of the new animal rights by being cold hearted ruthless and very human like in his attempts to become very powerful snowball on the other hand is the reason behind all of napoleons failures and mishaps he is also the main reason why the animal farm fails miserably in the end by clearly expressing all of the animals emotions during the chain of events director john stephenson does a great job of being very parallel with orwell s novel the different intelligence levels are also depicted very well from the quick witted pigs all the way down to the dense but extremely strong horses and other large farm animals the movie is much easier to understand than the novel and it is also a great way to clarify any confusion one might have after reading the novel 
first and best doper flick very enjoyable to those with a stoney point of view and even sober folks such as my pop can enjoy this one there is no mind blowing plot all these fellas want is to score some smoke now can t we all relate to that struggle check this out and also try nice dreams the next movie still smokin corsican bro s are for the hard core fans only they totally blow 
one of the best s b movies private school for girls is a really cheesy b movie from the s starring pheobe cates who starred in such greats as fast times at ridgemont high and gremlins and matthew modine star of the classic vision quest this movie is certainly one their worst but for b movie fans it s phenomenal one of the best scenes other then the topless betsy russel horse riding scene is the shower scene one of the guys sneaks into the girls locker room and hides in the sauna the song i love candy comes on and the girls come in for a shower everytime i hear that song i think of private school for girls i own the vhs and i have already pre ordered the dvd version hopefully it will remain un cut from the original

star trek at its best shore leave is one of the best episodesof the classic series it uses all thesci fi props but also has a great story if you don t even care about star trekand have to watch one watch this one 
the grey zone this is a film for those who seek reality without discounting the blackest realities imaginable based on a true story this film takes you inside aushwitz and lets you know heroes and others personally it gives you a reality i would certainly have never imagined even though i have worked with torture survivors from around the globe for several years i originally saw the film in ifc and immediately purchased it for my very limited dvd collection my collection does also offer comedies etc and movies like truman but this movie is real and moving and unforgettable and a part of history that must never be forgotten i feel it is very important regardless of some misgivings that it is an absolutely non fictional tale the author was really there i believe he did his best to show us the story he lived 
possible inspiration for star wars death star attack as another reviewer so astutely observed the climactic bombing run through a fjord at a specific target evokes the jedi attack on the death star at the conclusion of star wars while george lucas has acknowledged kurasawa s hidden fortress as a primary influence on star wars i wonder if he had squadron in the back of his mind when designing the end run on the death star something to ponder the other reviewers have said some wonderful things about the excellent and authentic aerial combat footage and the footage of the mosquito fighters themselves so i will only add my praise to theirs the only quibbles i have with the movie are the very fake miniature plane models used in the climactic bombing run cliff robertson s lack of a british accent he is playing an raf captain the only flaw in an otherwise marvelous performance and the trite standard romance that always seems a part of most war movies overall worth owning and watching several times 
wonderful video this is the first thing that i ever bought of the spice girls i wanted to know more about them their music before i got too invested well this video tells you everything about the girls more it shows how hard they work that they are all really down to earth girls who had a dream made it come true the girls comment on everything in the video providing info on events and footage they hadn t even seen before follow the girls behind the scenes of the making of their video say you ll be there see them at the famous oxford street lighting a pillowfight having some laughs and tons more this video also includes their first full length music videos for wannabe say you ll be there become mama who do you think you are also one of the biggest treats is at the end of this video when we get to see the girls perform their famous brit awards performance in of who do you think you are a very good video if you want to know more about the fab their first year of success

one of the most underappreciated movies of the s one of the most underappreciated movies of the s mumford is written directed by lawrence kasdan and is both really entertaining and funny loren dean plays a psychologist named mumford who lives in a small town called mumford mumford is the most popular psychologist in town although his methods are a bit strange he tells other people what his clients have told him he kicks people out of his office and still maintains a level of popularity among his patients are pruitt taylor vince trapped monster as a man who has film noirish fantasies in which he sees himself as a large muscular man jason lee mallrats my name is earl as a young billionaire who can t find happiness zooey deschanel winter passing elf as a young girl who s addicted to magazines mary mcdonnel as althea a woman obsessed with buying things and finally hope davis about schmidt the weather man as sofie a woman suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome while some of these characters are just there mumford befriends jason lee s character skip and falls in love with sofie martin short is also in the film an extended cameo basically as a criminal lawyer who was kicked out of mumford s office and seeks revenge all the actors are great in their performances dean is perfect as mumford lee is hilarious davis looks hot which i ve never percieved in any of her other movies and deschanel is great but almost unrecognizable this is truly a delightful movie and i hope that this will inspire someone to see it it s well made and very funny grade a

cute show great shows about binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself there s a cycling champion vance legstrong who inspires him to succeed wonder who that character is modeled after operation dw is about dw having surgery to get tubes put in her ears some really funny stuff in this one but that s pretty much par for the course with the dw based episodes 
my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
hype after watching hype for the first time last year i was left in awe at the beautifully created masterpiece that i had witnessed it came as a shock to me that this film was largely unheard of and very upsetting when i tried to get my hands on a copy for myself but could not find one therefore i am very pleased that lionsgate decided to take on hype and release it in dvd format this movie opened my eyes to the wonders of the seattle quotscenequot and the grunge music that i had previously ignored the film even inspired me to travle to seattle and explore it myself ! you do not need to be a fan of nirvana or soundgarden to enjoy this film as it deals with many other grunge acts besides the popular ones and it is more of an exploration into the societal aspects of this large cultural movement than a direct focus on certain bands enough said i highly reccommend this movie to anyone interested in musical history hype is a crowning achievement in my books 
family dissolution lust for power madness the story line is superb the scenery is stunning and gorgeous vast mountains and green valleys walled castles and fortresses hidetora the aging warlord holds a conference with his three sons and local chieftains on a mountainside he announces his decision to relinquish the leadership of his kingdom to the eldest of his three sons only one son the youngest dares to speak up and state that during his lifetime he has known only war and fighting he predicts the same after the transfer of power he believes there will be power struggles between his two older brothers due to jealousy the youngest brother personally has no desire to be warlord hidetora planned to leave one castle to each of his three sons he has each son hold an arrow and asks them to break it in half which they easily do he gives them in succession three arrows bundled together representing the unity of the family none can break the bundle this is hidetora s example of how the family will remain strong if they remain unified he envisions the house of ichimanji to be powerful and his eldest son to be overlord of the kingdoms attained during hidetora s own reign of power in his anger hidetora banishes the youngest son accusing him of defying his wishes yet subarua the youngest holds his father in esteem and respect throughout the predicted battles which come to pass hidetora visits taro s castle after the power transfer and finds his concubines have to bow and kneel to taro s wife sue they are forced to move out hidetora discovers after the transfer of power he is no longer respected sue married into the family to consolidate land holdings and property attained as the spoils of war a war in which her parents were murdered she harbored revenge in her heart ever since and now urges her husband to fight his brother jiro hidetora s court jester creates a mocking song about taro being like a gourd spinning this way and spinning that way implying he can not make a sound decision and stick with it at a family gathering taro hears the song and is outraged in a surprise move hidetora and his guards leave to visit jiro hidetora discovers he is not welcome there either not at all what he expected he left abruptly the treachery to gain power and control over the lands and castles by the two older brothers consumes them as predicted by subaru the younger brother war is inevitable local chieftains must decide where their loyalties lie which brother to support hidetora goes into hiding eventually he goes mad his only guard and caregiver the jester does not leave his side this film contains very strong battle scenes the desire for control and power is the true motivator for both older brothers loosely based on shakespeare s king lear this japanese version is astonishing in scope and grandeur the costumes and scenery are fabulous in the film there are tender moments between the jester and hidetora there are moving scenes where jiro s wife escapes to find her brother who was blinded in a past conquest and lives alone in a cottage the producers and directors create a phenomenal ending and conclusion at some point hidetora reawakens from his madness long enough to recognize the impact of his decision on his family and the near destruction of the kingdom he once ruled the ending is climactic and leaves a major impression on the viewer the film is amazing erika borsos erikab

future filmmakers beware terry gilliam is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most visionistic fimmakers of all timewith that said it breaks my heart seeing this documentary but am glad i did its about gilliams attempt in making the man who killed don quixote a movie that the great orson welles made an attempt at as well but also fell victim to acts of god as this film demonstrates the same i recommend this to any movie fan as it shows what goes into making a film from post production on something i m sure most people take for granted as a dreamer of making my own films one day i also recommend the same dreamers and future film directors to see this as it also shows how much strength mentally and physically you need to get into the business this is not to scare you out of your dream but to show you what it takes johnny depp is the big name here and you get to see him at work as well just the couple of scenes that were filmed of him are funny as hell which breaks my heart even more knowing that those scenes will never be used else where yes it s heart breakingbut it s also entertaining i won t go into anymore detail of what happens in this film as you need to see it for yourself yet another gilliam film added to my library 
great nostalgia trip i was when i watched these shows great memories and soupy sales is an added bonus just amazing how things have changed not sure if this set will appeal to the younger crowd but for us aging baby boomers it s a fun trip 
first class i saw this movie on vhs at the end of the s and always wanted to have it on a good quality i searched for it on the web and i found it on amazon i m very pleased to have it in my collection and i ow it all to amazon thanks 
absolutely wonderful especially for the hopeless romantics james caviezel shines as a man obsessed for revenege the character arch of danets youthful and unspoiled trust in people and friends to an elighted and educated man with a thirst revenge alone is a joy to watch no it s not exactly like dumas classic novel but it succeeds in being both a guy movie and a chick flick with its political politics and sword play along with a man scorned by love guy peace also puts in a great performance second to his wonderful momento highly highly recommended 
the us government should be ashamed of lying to the world for more than years this movie describes the assassination of president j f kennedy in dallas nov the documentary includes several video footage including the infamous zapruder film and pictures taken by several witnesses the movement of one of the killers in the knoll shown in one of the films shocked me it s also amazing how the cia fbi investigators tried to cover up the case for conspiracy also the video that shows one of the policemen turning on the mic on his radio near the motor of his motorcycle for the purpose of jamming the communications was very revealing one image can say more than words just by looking at the movie you can tell beyond any reasonable doubt that the last shot the one that took of his brain came from the front the last commission concluded that there shots and at least gunmen planted at the site in different locations a further analysis revealed at least shooters involved in the assassination it steel amazes me how this case was covered and the joke that was the warren comission i can only conclude that the conspiracy plot involved the highest spheres and institutions of this country

immortal yi soon shin is the best the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever korean american doesn t matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies hollywood cannot touch this one ! kim myoung min yi soon shin is outstanding in this ! no wonder he won the kbs best actor award for iyss it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional funny sad and can make you angry the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that my whole family kids and all watched this with me and loved it i can see why yi soon shin is korea s hero and why other countries teach his methods 
heart wrenching heart touching this is an absolute masterpiece this film will definitely become permanently etched in your mind after viewing it it will touch your heart and break your heart but you will never forget it jane wyman gives her absolute greatest performance and garners the oscar as a result wyman is also the prettiest little woman you ll ever see on film an absolute angel in this movie it is difficult to belive that this movie was released after her roles in such renowned classics as the lost weekend and the yearling by the way she is still living she was born in she would be this year as for the dvd excellent picture and sound no real extras too bad still worth the price 
extraordinary a little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both mr welles and the brazilian culture if there is one reason to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of the film a piece called quotfour men on a raft quot it is the most beautiful black and white short film i have ever seen the love mr welles had for these poor fishermen is so wonderfully apparent

easily one of the best performances best films dont resist it s been a long time since i ve bothered to write a review seems these days movies are all so normal nothing unique about them it s sad really this film is unique i relate this film to scarface as well as blowing me away ving rhames makes you believe he is the great don himself he took on the mob and he lived and he killed a man and beat it then he killed another and he got misdeamanor the man is a icon one of the greatest showboats to have ever lived he s also very intelligent and it s true he shouldn t have got such a bad rep but baby that sells violence sex crime it all sells the media you know this film is a stars if you don t see this then i pity you if you say this movie is like reviewer number one then your an this film is brilliant a masterpiece this film is also almost out of print obviously like divinci a true artist isn t respected till he is gone wan t a real world example look at tupac shakur when don is gone no one will ever be like him again so relish his kinglyness and buy this video before it is to late 
star trek at its best shore leave is one of the best episodesof the classic series it uses all thesci fi props but also has a great story if you don t even care about star trekand have to watch one watch this one 
central american farce give allen credit he learned early that sacred cows make the best hamburger this extremely politically incorrect and extremely funny satire should appall conservatives and delight liberals he correctly lambasts and lampoons american foreign policy and the american habit of treating world events like theater having howard cossell announcing as a play byplay the imminent assasination of a third world dictator is in extremely poor taste it is also hilariously dead on and sets the tone for the entire movie 
a brilliant film this film tells a powerful story a crime and punishment esque recovery of the soul except without the ending that dostoevsky had in his novel after neel auguste committs the murder madame la juliette binoche much like dostoevsky s sonya takes on the monumental task of recovering a lost soul and succeeds those who suggest this film is unrealistic have no grasp of eternal christian values of compassion and those who call this film ideological propaganda have no appreciation for beauty as the acting by all three especially kusturica and auteuil whom i have discovered through this film and who almost eclipse the talented binoche the cinematography and the directing are absolutely brilliant this is a must watch for many different kinds of people from those interested in st pierre miquelon i had to look up the islands on a map and was surprised to learn they are french not canadian to those who would like an illustration of why there is never a soul lost forever to those who would just like to receive aesthetic pleasure from a beautiful film finally some have commented on the character of neel auguste saying that he is retarded for not running away do not let a comment like that fool you it would not be made had the reviewer understood the character or even picked up on a direct quote from madame la you are so fatalistic never trust someone who tells you not to watch a movie watch it and decide for yourself i cannot envision that you wouldn t like it

brian regan first heard his stand up on cd when i worked at borders a few years back sometimes he gets a bit carried away a lotta comics tend to though and his comedy comes across dopey yet easy to relate to clean no naughty words or uncouth situations here ! family fun comedy dirty or clean as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well then he she is funny in my eyes 
pop culture bliss before anime was a household word kids were tuning in to see the ultimate mecha voltron defender of the universe every afternoon a sort of holy grail of an episode is the fleet of doom installment in which the the golion lion voltron team and the dairuggerxv vehichle voltron team up to battle an evil alliance between their respective nemesis king hazar and the drule empire i caught part of it once when i was a kid and was never able to catch it again i recently got this tape however and it does not dissapoint cheesy sure dated you bet fun you better believe it i could vege in front of this wonderful escapist fare for hours right now just as easily as i did all those years ago in fact i think i ll order a few more tapes and do just that

a high water mark for journalism and film one of the productions of which he is the most proud robert redford s all the president s men should be required viewing and the woodward bernstein book should be required reading for all who aspire to the profession of journalist redford was fascinated with the story of two young untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the watergate break in until it led to the highest office in the united states redford s involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary so he followed as the story developed he got to know bob woodward and carl bernstein when they were still at ground level still unsure as to where this would all lead but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics redford has always been a political animal with a reporter s instinct and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the american political climate earlier he and director michael ritchie had made the candidate a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well meaning of men or women and a film well worth your time it took two years of hard work to get all the president s men off the ground it was turned down by several studios with the excuse that people were tired of watergate but he was finally able to get warner bros to say yes provided redford himself would star dustin hoffman was enlisted to play carl bernstein redford s old friend jason robards won an oscar as washington post editor inchief ben bradlee jack warden was cast as editor harry rosenfeld martin balsam was editor howard simons jane alexander was judy hoback bookkeeper to the committee to re elect the president creep ned beatty was martin dardis who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence stephen collins was hugh sloan whose wife debbie played by meredith baxter kept his conscience working on the right side robert walden who would go on the the fine television series lou grant was dirty trickster donald segretti and hal holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story the mysterious deep throat who helped woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall of course we now know that deep throat was the fbi s assistant director w mark felt an old friend of woodward s and a man torn between his loyalty to the fbi and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings onredford asked alan j pakula to direct and gordon willis to handle the cinematography and they crafted a look that is part documentary part thriller if you get a chance also see pakula and willis the parallax view starring warren beatty another outstanding scary political film william goldman who won an oscar for butch cassidy and the sundance kid wrote the tight exciting screenplay for which he won again this was actually the fourth time redford and goldman had worked together goldman also adapted donald e westlake s the hot rock a very funny caper film and the poignant the great waldo pepper which was out for a short time on dvd in pan and scan but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful widescreen splendor universal where are you the efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes all the president s men a smashing success it succeeds as an exciting suspenseful procedural as a statement on the neccessity of a free press as a character study and as a great movie moviethe double disc dvd set is the one to buy the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp clean aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by redford himself the second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film on woodward and bernstein and on deep throat there is also a vintage documentary on the making of the film and an interview with jason robards on the dinah shore show a deserved landmark in film and in journalism all the president s men is a must see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be a must own in our darkest hour when all seems obfuscated and hopeless it reminds us that light can be brought to bear people can make a difference 
orwell was a futurist i loved the book in an oddly fascinating way and the same with the film although the film is not a blow by blow account from the book it serves to relay the darkness of the hour for humankind it is one film that i watch at least annually orwells vision of a future where public opinion and even personal thoughts are virtually controlled by big brother is at our doorstep think in terms of the controlled media and political correctness and the patriot act history is being rewritten as we speak orwell may have had insider information on the future that we are all rapidly seeing come into fuition he was a member of several secret societies in london notably the fabian society whose members advocate a socialist big brother control of the populace the acting in the film is first rate while the scenery conveys the hopelessness of the situation it is a must see 
seasonal classic i m an avid movie maniac i have certain films that i can only watch at certain times of the year and do every year other peoples money starts off my fall movie viewing after halloween of course i love the new england autumn charm of this film the story is good dialogue clever and the chemistry between miller and devito is scary an unlikely romanic couple if ever there was a classic in my book

ain t spandex great this is an hbo remake of the original s footer naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era however it still captures the thrills and chills you may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever rats nancy the little woman does not have quite the devoted husband here life is not quite ideal soon a chance encounter with aliens the space type leaves her feeling bigger about the situation foot bigger now it is nancy s turn for a little revenge the ending is a little unnerving be sure to see daryl in just as serious of a role in high spirits 
john lennon in his own words imagine is a feature length documentary about john lennon s life centred around the imagine recording sessions but also featuring footage from the beatle era his marriage with yoko his lost weekend period and a few home movies all the way to the year of his death it uses john s own voice as narration taken from the hours of interviews he did throughout his life and features alternate and remixed versions of his songs as a soundtrack of sorts as well as interviews from all sorts of people from sean lennon to george martin though it s not as detailed or as long as say the beatles anthology i still think it is a really fine look at john lennon s life every moment of the film is interesting i reckon and if i was to pick a favorite scene i d probably pick the whole thing ! there s john s encounter with a tripping fan at his doorstep who he talks lyrics with and invites in for tea there s an interview with may pang johns one time mistress who suggests that john s lost weekend period wasn t so lost he released a few albums during that period socialized a lot more and collaborated with a lot of people there s the bed in debate between john and cartoonist al capp over lyrics art and money one of the most infamous scenes of the film the movie captures who john was really well i thought he was a thoughtful man a witty man whose words were often misunderstood despite the fact he put out his point of view honestly and openly the places he live in seem to be characters in the documentary too i think and evoke the things john liked to surround himself with the peace of tittenhurst estate the bustle of s london the big liverpool feel of early s new york they re all great backdrops to the tale special features include a tribute to john lennon a more recent piece where the filmmakers and yoko discuss the making of the documentary gushing about john on the way there s the truth be told interview which was originally done for radio though for the dvd you get the visual footage too in the interview john discusses love sex and selling out throughout the history of art there s an acoustic version of imagine an interview with john s school principal william pobjoy regarding john s school days and friendship with pete shotton plus footage of john buying a constructing a small playhouse on an island in the lake at tittenhurst estate what s most interesting about this footage i think is julian lennon s relationship with yoko at least in those days they seem to be getting on quite well yoko waving to jules across the lake and julian happily calling back definitely worth a look for beatles fans and documentaries 
angie toting a machine gun this can t get any better glorious trash fest with angie dickinson reprising her role of hard boiled gun toting wilma mcclatchie featuring danielle brisebois and julie mccullough as her buck wild daughters billie jean and polly this isn t so much a sequel as it is a remake of the original big bad mama angie dickinson sprouts out plenty of one line zingers while brisebois and mccullough really just stand there looking pretty do some requisite nude scenes flirt with cowpokes and of course carry around machine guns in violin cases produced by roger corman nuff said 
the theme of transcendence is important not the factual debates about rubin carter i was very touched by this movie it was not the actual story plot or it s accuracy that was important to me rather what was meaningful about this film was the portrayal of a personal transcendence the main character brings about in his life from rage hate and bitterness to self caring willingness to learning inner directedness to a sense of spirituality and something bigger than himself to forgiveness and letting go and then the untimate transcendence reaching out risking trusting others with his core pain and risking loving others also this film portrays some very rare people who demonstrate commitment to their principles determination to care about the individual and to rectifying an injustice i do not know whether or not rubin carter murdered those people from my stand point this is a movie that models personal healing it is touching and inspirational even if it were to turn out to be total fiction

best jackie chan movie ever amazing i have seen this movie at least a dozen times and it is still amazing there is so much action so much choreography that is impossible to take in every second of it after watching this only once the legend of drunken master has the best jackie chan fighting i have ever seen but also a good story with a nice plot good characters and villains and dubbing that actually isn t too badly done the story has a good focus on family and what wong fei hung jackie chan must do in order to honor his family and his country by stopping thieves from stealing and exporting chinese artifacts that represent china s history sounds a bit boring but the story develops nicely in the film after the first minutes you may not care because the beginning of the movie has an incredible fight scene promising just some of the action yet to come some of the action scenes mid way through the movie are so good they are better than a lot of final fight scenes in other similar movies by the time the final fight scene in this movie is over you may not even have realized that straight minutes passed by it really is that long of a scene and it is very very entertaining chan does not do many stunts in this movie but rather displays his true and raw martial arts skills specifically the uniqe form of drunken boxing if you have never seen a jackie chan movie and want to start watch another one of his films first this one is so good it might just spoil the rest 
groundbreaking achievement franco zefferelli s jesus of nazareth has many boasting rights authenticity and loftiness are presented at the right moments the acting is good throughout and the stirring crowd scenes genuinely bring the new testament to life especially considering it was a television mini series the craftsmanship was impeccable robert powell has a hypnotic presence as jesus but some of the supporting cast are even better james farentino plays rough like few peters in cinematic memory and michael york presents passion without overdoing it as john the baptist anne bancroft however shines brightest as mary magdalene with a particularly well rounded before and after performance being a leap forward with scenes that unfold quickly without lingering too long mostly and important scenes that cling long enough jesus of nazareth is a landmark movie although in places it should be conceded their interpretations explain too much even when some of the historical context is often excellent particularly because they never shoot a scene that seems like it s in a studio zefferelli s jesus is a true achievement also starring laurence olivier james earl jones ernest borgnine anthony quinn and many others 
a very good movie with only one small problem the guy playing frankenstein looks almost exacrly like michael palin from monty python making it a bit hard to take serious you expect the knights who say nih to jump out of the bushes at any moment 
wholesome entertainment this film is just long enough to enjoy a small part of beethovens life however humorous it is seriously sad when beethoven expresses his pain from the loss of his hearing the gatekeeper learns selflessness and becomes understanding of the importance of people in our lives this approx one hour video is reccomended for all ages 
i ve got a jones for love jones this is one of my absolute favorites and if you have never seen you must a beautiful love story that shows you love never fails ! lorenz tate and nia long were excellent and isiah washington delivers a memorable performance as savon loved the movie so much i even named my son savaughn 
propaganda but very well done dziga vertov s film is an amazing and quite daring foray into the realm of experimental cinema i say this with some reservations see below the viewer is quite literally transported to the soviet union of the past we witness love and loss happiness and sadness life and death we witness the beginning of a day and the end of a day a wedding and a divorce a birth and a funeral all the scenes are real the birth is a real birth the funeral a real funeral the divorce a real divorce nationalistic and cultural boundaries begin to fade since the events depicted say more about human nature than they do about a particular people the music is quite inventive and amazing especially when one considers that only three young men are performing it the editing is some of the most astonishing ever to come out of soviet silent cinema that said there is a somewhat irritating political message that comes forth that industrialization will solve the problems of humanity that those who follow the party line are the ones depicted as being sober and responsible so many people are shocked by nazi propaganda films such as triumph of the will i find it sad that more people are not troubled by soviet era films which tout the beauty of marxist leninism while ignoring the carnage and sometimes outright genocide ie the ukranians carried out by the soviets for over seventy years the fact of the matter is that soviet marxist leninism slaughtered millions of people and enslaved millions of others this is a troubling hunk of history that is difficult to ignore when watching this otherwise masterful work of filmmaking 
mogambo frankly i have not watched this dvd version yet as i have it on laser disc 
am i my brothers keeper i am a resident of central new york and this story was very well known to everybody in these parts if your reading this you probally have read some of the other reviews so i ll be brief this is an incredible film you are taken to a place that exists and people that are exactly what you see its almost like travelling back to the turn of the century when you visit the ward farm the ward brothers were indeed considered outsiders by some locals but they ultimatelywere a genuine thread that made up the fabric of this community and after delbert is charged with his brothers murder and when the people sensed a railroading by a politically minded d athey rally to delbert s defense it is a unique look at small town america from its citizens its lifestyle and its politics the film is sometimes funny disturbing and even uncomfortable at times but it is as powerful an experience as you could ever have like another documentary i have seen sunshine hotel about flophouses on the bowery in new york city it pulls no punches and hits hard gritty and bold it will resonate long after its final credits have rolled 
i love this movie this movie came out when i was twelve and i have been in love with it ever since it brought me a rural farm kid the magic of leonard cohen concrete blond was not was the beastie boys and all of the other wonderful musicians who grace this film it also brought me christian slater in a role that i would later relate to in a big way as a teen in short for reasons all sentimental i love this film it may not have cohesiveness in the same way heathers does but it has heart and that is something that teen movies seem to lack these days so watch this flick and be grateful that you are no longer in high school i know i do 
mr kotcheff is a master story teller mr kotcheff canadian is able to cast his objective but sympathetic eye over a range of topics and the humans involved in them and provide us with some insights whilst telling a story with panache and a great deal of skill even if he touches all the typical emotional cues listed in drama one of his master works about the darker side of the australian outback wake in fright thought lost for ever has recently been discovered in a rubbish tip his first blood gave a comic book slant to agent orange and the pyschosis of a viet vet and north dallas forty reveals professional football as a pretty dispiriting business with the players tools to be used at the pleasure of the businessmen if it is the case that the american empire began its slide as it sank into the vietnam war some of the reasons might be found in north dallas forty which is pretty savage in its depiction of materialism the tv sinking inthe swimming pool the hunger guests have for the electronic toys rubbish stacked on a table the black white divide simmering beneath the relationships between players the hypocrisy the myth of competitiveness and its alleged blessings business which runs the game just as it runs the war haliburton nick nolte is a confused player who loves the game but cannot understand the world his battered body symbolizes a battered spirit the answer is love mr nolte as phil elliot grid iron star with magic catching hands does not take the final pass in the street from a fellow player with his collar undone and the ball at his feet he s out of the game and back into life personally i find football grid iron but not soccer a stupid and violent game and this is confirmed by the backstage dressing room scenes mr kotcheff tells a great story but 
eddie cruises dear amazon i was happy to receive a copy of eddie and the cruisers it s a film i first saw years ago or so and have never seen again since so the film was available on dvd thru amazon the price was undeniably good and the convenience of amazon made it easy to get a copy of the film ! everyone s a winner thank you sincerelyscott gregor 
better than i had expected okay i decided on this movie after a bit of apprehension i mean the only reasons i even considered watching it was because jason scott lee is from hawaii like me we both went to the same high school really i always try to support asian american actors even if they don t usually get good roles so with that in mind i really wasn t expecting much in fact i thought it would be worse than the van damme original which although one of his better movies was still a waste of a couple of hours of my life i mean straight to dvd sequel could never match a big budget hollywood movie right well i m glad to say i was wrong this is actually a pretty darned decent movie better than the original that s for sure thomas ian griffith and jason scott lee are both great their roles are complex as there is a lot of grey area in terms of their being good and evil but i thought they handled it well unfortunately i still had some trouble seeing jsl as anything other than bruce lee in quotdragonquot which wasn t helped by his fight scenes where he still looks like the dragon special effects were your typical sci fi channel stuff nothing to write home about costumes and sets seemed a bit forced in period scenes so it didn t come across as very natural but hey like i said sci fi channel stuff in general the acting was very good all things considered with only a few actors coming up lame see tava smiley who is hot but couldn t act her way out of a paper bag the action sequences were kind of forced into the script some of it didn t seem terribly necessary but when it happens jsl and tig are great and while jsl is great in his fight scenes it was kind of sad to think that he ll be relegated to these kinds of roles because of his ethnicity and while he does need some range to pull off this role not much acting is required and he is a better actor than this movie allows him to be tig of course is a wonderful villain now if you could only get his role from quotthe karate kid quot out of your head i actually enjoyed the story as i like time travel movies and while it can be bewildering figuring out what s going on as the characters jump back and forth in time the main idea of the movie if we could go back in time should we be are we morally obligated to right the wrongs of the past comes through if you re going to watch this expecting a hollywood summer blockbuster movie you will be sorely disappointed if you love the sci fi channel like i do and want to watch a grade quotaquot b movie this is it ! the cast is great the story interesting and the action entertaining adjusted for the kind of movie it is straight to dvd i give it a solid four stars a pleasant surprise and one of the best direct to video movies i ve ever seen 
my man dr smith is a riot in this episode dr smith and the robot go hog wild switching personalities and swapping insults this is a great episode 
a great piece of eye candy i really loved this film i m a sucker for b style sci fi films and am a regular with scifi channel flicks like this plus james spader rocks ! while the plot is thin at times it s a great piece of sci fi with some good special effects and a neat loner main character a definite watcher 
you feel like you re there great music makes you want to get up and dance or sing or both filming in a new york winter helps to really bring you into their angst i loved it 
worth a roll of the dice the varied reactions to this movie by other reviewers are interesting but nonetheless surprise me de gustibus and all that i suppose released in but set in this is a well written and well acted drama with much of the feel of s and s noir the look of the film presumably deliberately also has the style of an earlier era the sound track with ivory joe hunter lincoln chase big joe turner and others couldn t be more suitable the sleaze of course is much more advanced than would have been permissible thirty years earlier the hero j c cullen matt dillon is more complex than a pure country innocent corrupted by a wicked woman lorry dane diane lane a stripper at the gem club a small town gambler trying to make it big in chicago he has his own dark or at least not solight side which is why he takes up with lorry so readily yet he at least struggles with his conscience even if he doesn t always do the right thing tommy lee jones and bruce dern are in fine form as villains lee grant has just the right touch and diane lane has never been more stunning or more credible in a role the big town is not a big movie but it is a good one

my favorite episode i don t have television haven t for years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i ve purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows 
compellingly masterful rendering of a day or two in the life read alex grayson s articulate and thoughtful review jan which nails it apparently chelsea walls is not for everyone but if you watch this movie with an open heart and mind i promise it will provide a compelling and realistic portrait of actions interactions and reactions so common among my fellow artists it breaks my heart the one element i find lacking is the artist writer who is truly grounded that absence detracts only a little though from an otherwise truthful portrayal of the life of many artists at all stages of life love and the pursuit of creativity despite the tawdry details of life among the creative with its erratic narrated background of dylan thomas masterful under milkwood an edgy musical score and the realism of the indie lighting style to set the tone the visual and actual poetry of ethan hawkes directorial debut sing with beauty truth and love 
one of milos forman s best don t get me wrong i love amadeus and cuckoo s nest etc but this was just such a quietly funny and enjoyable film i have to say it may almost be my favorite from milos forman i think i first heard it spoken of by james mangold in the commentary for his film heavy mangold was in awe of milos forman and also enjoyed ozu s films that being said i was quite excited for the dvd to be released and was not at all dissapointed in the film it s really funny and heartbreaking i loved it 
great show this was a great show that was another one of the victims of fox it got moved around aired eps in the wrong order etc it should ve been given more time but it wasnt however there is a movie now thanks to browncoats everywhere ! if you like joss whedon this show is for you if you like scifi this show is definately for you it s kindof a scifi western combo that i thought was pretty original to my knowledge no ones ever made a show like this did i mention joss whedon wrote it 
wo can resist a movie with bette i love this movie it is such great escapism they all play good roles and although not the most refined screenplay ever written it has all the stuff that a feel good movie needs i especially love when bette sings that beautiful song in the restaurant somewhere along the way i adore her voice and what a great all rounder she is there are very few true divas that can act sing dance and be comedic as well this is one of my all time favorites for a good laugh and i have to admit that most of my favorites were never box office hits 
my daughter likes i bought this and the care bears movie a new generation for my year old for her birthday and she loves to watch both movies 
glad to find it i saw this movie a long time ago and couldn t find it anywhere i was very excited when i finally found it and for a great price too ! 
rock hard candy a very different type of movie minimum props and cost in production but thrilling from almost start to end a few good twists and acting well some future stars in here there is found the movie entertaining and not disturbing but made the people i saw this with think personally liked this and was recommended for me to watch by a friend i would do likewise to you 
tv s best miniseries the title just represents my opinion but this is without a doubt one of the best if not the best of the tv mini series this was followed by the all tooshort regular weekly series also available on dvd and v the final battle and that s the order you want to watch them in that way everything ties together and you aren t wondering what went on and why something in the final battle is happening the original though is still the best friendly aliens come to earth in need of water supposedlyand we find out they aren t what they seem and it makes for gripping viewing even if you ve seen it before it even features a young robert englund freddy kreuger in nighmare on elm street as a good alien there are shades of nazi germany and the persecution of the jews running rampant through the series showing perhaps that what happened once can happen again and it doesn t have to be a madman who s responsible for the genocide taking place while it came out over years ago v is just as gripping and exciting today as it was when it first came out 
great legal thriller this movie is by far among the greatest legal thrillers i ve seen not only because the writing and directing are superb but james woods acting performance is nothing short of spectacular the variations he projects in his character expressions with so many subtle nuances make him believable and fetching as that character and when his sense of right is piqued he explodes in the most compelling absorbing credible way one which just pulls you another foot deeper into the story kind of the way quicksand pulls you in you just can t get out nor do you want to in this story the woods character is fighting not only for an innocent man s life a prisoner doing time but even more important he s fighting for his own life his sense of self respect honor and decency none of which he feels in his earlier law practice while defending and acquitting sleazeballs whom he knows should be in prison instead wrecking society with their crimes i watched this movie a second time the night after i watched it the first time and got even more out of it buy it and keep it it s far batter than most of the john grisham legal thriller movies no question about it james woods is one of the most underrated actors today he performed almost equally as well in indightment the mcmartin child abuse case ive omitted talking about the plot because you can obtain that from many of the below reviewers 
hepburn s best others have reviewed this film extensively in this forum simply put this was audrey hepburn s best performance and should have brought her a second oscar win

the time comes for some to fade the elusive behavior of those golden years better known as the sweet bird of youth is depicted with a reality sense and certain melodrama touch the early years between tea sam and coles are frenetic rapture and the triangle works out till the time comes for them ten years pass away coles has found claire tea is happily married and is owner of a beautiful restaurant and sam still has not found her bliss from here to there she has walked in mirror circles casually there will be a reencounter among coles and sam and certainly they will revive their past and furious sexual meetings but somehow this spell does not work out the ancient emotive memories still permeates the soul of coles he definitively has not grown up and still pretends to play in two stages he like narcissus only loves himself and the rest of his affairs work out as a secure support for his disastrous self stem as you know the domain in love falls back in whom loves less but this last experience with venus will define for sam a crucial cross road coles still has not learned anything about the sensible difference between the sex by itself and the love as a whole the film bets hard but the wager did not go far beyond the door of the dark room somehow this film remitted me to a much more mature work in the last eighties the woman in flames something happened with this movie in which you can feel the ending is not absolutely natural it seems after you decided to break the rules you insisted in going back obeying the moral principles instead of walking to the tragic consequences because i think this picture had all the basic ingredients for a moral fable but also a tragic ending was there fear perhaps to follow this road good performances specially of mark ruffalo excellent camera work and memorable angles shots with perfect illuminating interesting plot but it promised much more than what it offered 
great buy it was a great buy ! got the movie in great time and there wasn t a thing wrong with it ! thanks 
mongolians ever wonder where the idea of the magic carpet ride comes from well look no further than raoul walsh and douglas fairbanks s the thief of bagdad an amalgamation of arabian nights magic romance fantasy mythical travelogue and sense of fun the thief of bagdad transcends the irony of its caricatures and stereotypes not just from what it reifies but by what it invents with its theme nestled squarely on the precept that happiness must be earned the thief of bagdad starts with fairbanks as a happy golucky middle eastern street thief the first of many negative stereotypes though at first this cheerful thief who feels he can take what he wants and no rules apply the road to salvation begins when he falls in love with the caliph s daughter julanne johnston things take on a different significance true to character fairbanks starts by pretending to be a prince to win her over found out the thief ends up punished and then humbled in the end seeking the counsel of the holy man he earlier abused he is advised hat if he truly loves the princess he himself must make the transformation and become a prince the epic begins when all suitors must come up with a unique gift as with all good epics the thief on a fantastic storybook return there and back again to the bottom of the sea haunted by sirens as well as giant spiders to the space above the clouds where fairbanks discovers the home of the winged horse and the sanctuary of the moon when taking into consideration filmic representations i was drawn to this movie via my interest in anna may wong as the mongol slave however after further consideration i was drawn to the character of sojin who plays the mongol prince with purposeful intent or by accident the mongol prince comes across with the same type acquisitiveness of a dr fu manchu coincidence perhaps but it is an interesting phenomenon to observe while both the mongols slave and prince sneak about the orientals in our imagination are reified well it is a magical carpet ride right miguel llor

the history a cult is trying to hide i can see how current members of the prem rawat maharaji cult wouldn t like this video mostly because it shows a history of their master that his cult is trying very hard to hide from the public because it doesn t fit into his current pr campaign to get new devotees there is nothing biased or one sided about this video and it certainly isn t amateur and it wasn t put together by maharaji s former followers disgruntled or otherwise in fact it s an extremely well done documentary made for pbs that documents without any narration or explanation analysis whatsoever a period in american history specifically what actually happened at the millennium festival when mr rawat the living perfect master said he was going to present his plan for world peace the video simply records the actual speeches of mr rawat and the statements of his devotees the end result is an historical record of a young guru who believes he is the incarnation of god who seems to have a pathological need to be worshipped and the idealistic young people who got caught up in his cult back in the mid s the fact that this story does not fit conveniently in mr rawat s attempts over the years to pretend those embarassing events never happened may upset his followers but it does not in any way discredit the historians nor the thousands of people who witnessed those events 
incredibly funny certainly one of the funniest films ever great acting and directing especially suitable for dog owners but not limited to them 
my kind of movie i would like to say i like this movie ! i have always been the all american type guy who likes the excitement of a good revenge film this one is a dandy ! the actors bring the characters to life and the beauty of the landscape where it was filmed is nice not only did i enjoy watching the film but i was in it playing the part of a trucker in the diner scene and a neo nazi at the stone quarry scene i must say it was a joy working with director star phillip rhee the cast and crew they were a top notch act if you get a chance to rent or buy this movie do so you won t be disappointed 
mutiny of the truth oh for the good old days when you could take a historical event and change it willy nilly in order to suit the story you want to tell the real story of mutiny on the bounty is possibly more interesting than in the film but to have the captain as the good guy didn t suit the times during the depression when you were supposed to barrack for the underdog but having said that and taking this film wholly as a work of fiction it is a rolicking sea yarn full of whipping chains tropical islands keehauling evil ship captains terrible storms drownings starvation and bravery according to a newsreel that comes with this dvd mutiny on the bounty was very expensive and it took about two years to make the special effects are fantastic for the time and the acting especially laughton and grable but not excluding the others is superb

spicy and fun yet dramtic too compelling performances this darkly comic yet compelling bdsm light relationship is blessed with great performances by maggie gyllenhaal and james spader the script is well written little personal moments in the film are beautifully shot and the actors really find the soul of the characters they portray at its heart it s really a sweet if slightly disturbing romance where one person s unique need for control meets up beautifully with someone else s unique need to submit sexy yes disturbing a little worth watching absolutely if you like unusual films odd love stories and quirky characters this is a must see

nothins gonna happen to me i love sean penn as an actor he s so versatile and can play just about any part i had never even heard of bad boys before i was simply looking through dvd s at hastings one day and the title caught my eye films concerning criminals and misfits have always been a thing of curiosity for me and a film of this kind starring sean penn made it seem even better i bought the film and have loved watching it since sean penn plays mick o brien a mop haired street thug from chicago who loves the thrill of juvenile crime from stealing purses to using firearms his number one enemy is a hispanic juvenile drug dealer named paco played by esai morales who also has eyes for mick s beautiful girlfriend j c played by the lovely ally sheedy after o brien and paco are involved in a hideous shootout that has mick going on a high speed police chase and leaves paco s kid brother dead mick is sentenced to rainford correctional facility to serve time for his crimes suddenly o brien is plunged into a world of his own kind rapists murderers and robbers they spit on you and taunt you they whistle at you and try to extort you but that is the least of mick s problems he must deal with the head bad boys of the clan tweetie is a tough african american with angry intimidating eyes who makes the younger newcomers his love interests and bullies o brien during his cleaning aka s t house patrol time tweetie s accomplice is a large blonde muscled guy named viking who loves torturing o brien during lunch or dinnertime and sneering in his face together tweetie and viking keep everyone in line by shoving them around and flashing tough stares at them my favorite character in the film is horowitz portrayed excellently by eric gurry the small skinny jewish kid who spends most of his time with his nose in a book or fixing radios but horowitz is just as dangerous as he is intelligent and he is proof that you can be tough in other ways besides being big rough and muscular horowitz looks as ordinary as they come but don t be fooled by that horowitz is mick o briens cellmate who eventually becomes his accomplice after mick raises hell with tweetie and viking and is dubbed the new barn boss with horowitz s help mick gains a better idea of the pecking order and different attitudes around the institution and can prepare himself for what lies ahead horowitz also tosses in a few surprises such as cleverly executing a corrosive way for mick to escape from the institution to see j c and making a radio explode in a much needed damaging way even with his small stature horowitz is feisty and stands up to the bigger bad boys when the time is right i guess i get a kick out of horowitz because he s so deceiving and i admire his courage to fight despite his size i also like his laid back matter offact personality just listen to the story he tells mick about the bowling alley he blew up but the worst is yet to come for mick after beating and raping j c paco is transported to rainford where he is united again with his beloved enemy mick everyone has heard of the beef between the two and they can all smell blood almost as soon as paco steps foot in the institution the hatred is as raw as they come paco out to get mick for killing his kid brother and mick out to get paco for what he did to his girlfriend now everything can become a weapon and paco is lifting weights with determination on the night of the fight crafty paco goes to great lengths to make sure that there will be no authority figures in the way and he and mick have a nasty and bloody showdown throughout the film mick is never one to show much emotion but at the last part of the film we actually see some the only other time you see emotion on mick s face is when he sees j c after her attack everything about bad boys is awesome the casting is wonderful a truly talented bunch of young men who exhibit the raw toughness that comes with being in a juvenile institution the whole prison atmosphere is incredibly real the moment mick walks in he sees all the street wise looking tough young guys smoking their cigarettes whistling at him and gazing at him with cockiness their idea of a warm welcome is spitting in your face and making you clean bathrooms the movie is a fascinating real portrayal of the very gritty atmosphere that these guys call home for the time being there are cold cells with bunk beds a desk and a closet an occasional foosball table and rc cola machines cafeteria food that you d want to feed to your dog and a small black and white television for old movies recreation consists of some time for tackle football in the field or jogging between the double fences chores consist of things such as burning wood watering plants and working in the fields oh yeah and if you need to satisfy your nicotine cravings you have to cut a deal with an italian guy and an asian guy who control the cigarettes and other things one may want to smoke there s also solitary confinement if you get too out of control with good reason the guards lock themselves in cages away from the main room until there is a situation that needs to be taken care of those who enjoy sean penn true crime cop shows and other subjects involving delinquent behaviors and jailing will enjoy this excellent film of the brutality the trials and the tribulations of juvenile prisons and those thriving within them all the attitude that you can handle comes in this film special features include the theatrical trailer and a commentary from director richard rosenthal about the making of the film the casting and various other things i kind of wish they would have had the gang of sean penn esai morales eric gurry and ally sheedy back for an interview segment on their own thoughts and opinions about the film though i don t know why this film didn t get as much recognition but it definitely should have of course this film was made back in so perhaps these types of films were not as popular at that time as they might be today but nevertheless bad boys deserves to stand the test of time and should be enjoyed by all 
not your average night of theatre samuel beckett s soon to be classic drama about two men vlad and estro transcends stage play drama beckett s relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic literal story most drama should be seen on stage so that the performers can give their characters shape bring in an audience and produce a night of dramatic arts that is not how this story seems to go not at all indeed becketts story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor here are two men both obviously at the end of their ropes but each keeps this asinine hope that godot will show up but he never does extra characters like pozzo and lucky simply add to the intended confusion as several previous reviewers have taken note there is not action while this idea is spurred by the threepenny opera beckett takes postmodernism another step further the characters are so disillusioned the question becomes godot isn t coming so did he ever care could godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state a fantastic read and one of the best dramas ever written this fairly short play should be read by everyone 
shakespeare would be proud when it comes to film adaptations most films fail in some way to think that a japanese film director could transform one of the greatest plays written in the english language and mke it his own is quite tremendous to think that he could use japanese noh theater images to enhance the adpatation is a stroke of genius mifune is one of the greatest actors to play macbeth and dare say maybe the best akira kurosawa directed a masterpiece and proves why he is at the top of the pantheon of great world directors and of course the criterion collection folk out do themselves again thank goodness for them because of it wasn t for them we all would be missing out on great films 
one of the greatest films of all time despite what some people might think boyz n the hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle it is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in america i would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie this was john singleton s first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then year old could write such a powerful script every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them cuba gooding jr is superb as tre styles a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father furious lawrence fishburne furious is also played excellently by fishburne despite appearing as strict he keeps tre on the right path and as a year old tre is a mature and well rounded individual tre s friends are brothers doughboy ice cube ricky morris chestnut two very different people ricky like tre is an aspiring college student while doughboy is fresh out of jail and looked down upon by his mother the script is so well written that even a character like doughboy can be sympathised with though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface he is also loyal and caring to his friends it is the depth of all the characters and several superb acting performances that make the film so great i don t want to give away any plot details for those who haven t seen it but the film is really tragic in the end and is a realistic take on life in the hood in south central i don t care where your from or what colour your skin is you can enjoy and be moved by this film a true masterpiece 
fantastic family film a family oriented film that is humorous fun exciting and very entertaining ! after seeing this movie for the first time i had to own it ! it is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean this is a must own for the family

a denture rattling live performance this is faith no more at their absolute best a smashing live performance that runs thru their pre hits culminating with a mind blowing cover of black sabbath s war pigs this show is tight the sound is tremendous i ve completely corrupted my friends with it and now they all want copies 
magnificent transfer by criterion i am not going to write about the merits of ran i e it is a given that it is perhaps kurosawa s finest work if you bought the previous masterworks edition and are sitting on the fence whether to purchase the criterion don t hesitate the masterworks transfer is a travesty compared to the criterion the colors just bleed in the masterworks whereas here the colors are perfect and vibrant on the masterworks dvd there is a restoration demo which i thought was a joke since they did a lousy job compared to the criterion get this dvd if you are a kurosawa fan you won t regret it this is perhaps the finest criterion dvd that i have purcased and i own over criterions 
great thing recommend for all who is the fan of transformers great thing recommend for all who is the fan of transformer

an immensely beautiful film turned into a classic shane is not a western like howard hawk s red river nor a meditation on history and character like john ford s the searchers it is the most tasteful achievement ever invented to create a legend an instant myth only stevens meticulously picturesque visuals and his evident desire to treat western as art could have mastered the archetypal simplicity and vitality of shane in shane the good and evil govern stevens mastery of technique with his golden good looks his calm authority and his almost magical magnetism alan ladd is the mysterious lone rider called shane his antithesis a sinister figure all in sable and enemy a merciless gunfighter from the cheyenne area named jack wilson jack palance wilson is dark dresses in black and even drinks black coffee from a dark black pot shane sparkles with personality and presence wilson spreads menace and evil shane is the fastest gun alive who shoots to kill only when it is inevitable wilson wearing two guns and walking with jangling spurs is a psychopath and a sadist a man totally without moral redemption the film controls that mystical force that runs like a fine thread through a western story the mysterious gunslinger who rides into town at exactly the right moment that history requires him fulfills his destiny and then rides on there is novelty and charm in shane because the stranger who appears from nowhere is a man of exceptional quality admired by a wonderful kid with bright face and resolute boyish ways shane tests the spirit of this little eight year old boy joey starrett brandon de wilde in the midst of all the tensions and excitements on that open range what is admirable about shane is not his skill with his gun but his restraint in using it shane knows that joey is admiring him for the wrong reasons even though he knows that if he kills wilson he ll have to leave the valley he tells joey theres no living with a killing however we want him to show joey how brave and fast he is the ultimate confrontation in that depressed and faint saloon gives the movie the quality of a fine album of paintings of the frontier joeys plaintive call come back shane is the famous cry of all the audience for a mythical idolized hero so complete and correct who would not permit himself to be admired by a boy for living by the gun the closing scenes remain among the most haunting memories in the history of cinema the characters that stevens actors have drawn might be considered portraits of familiar frontier types marian starrett jean arthur is the mother who criticizes shane for initiating her young boy into young manhood by passing on his values she is the little woman unsettled who always wanders what are you fighting for she is the married woman who reveals an unspoken love joe starrett van heflin is the stubborn father and a hard working rancher determined with his forcible patience and fortitude to build a life on the land for his family rufus ryker emile meyer is the evil aging cattle rancher who considers the arrival of homesteaders is reducing grazing opportunities for his herds limiting their access to water he does everything to rid the land of the humble farmers morgan ryker john dierkes is rufus brother foreman who invites starrett to talk reasonably chris calloway ben johnson is the authentic cowboy who has had a change of heart and has quit ryker s bunch he warns shane in the barn that starrett is up against a stacked deck frank stonewall torrey elisha cook jr is the pale eyed pathetic local farmer who in a fit of fury and mad courage attempts to challenge his tormentor but an outraged amateur can never beat an accomplished professional he is brutally gunned down in the first shocking and horrific showdown on the western screen palance toys with the little man and kills him in one of the most realistic scenes staged until that time shane is an immensely beautiful film stunningly photographed in color rich in memorable and exhilarating moments every scene is composed with extreme care the deer will raise its head and frame the oncoming rider perfectly between the branches of his antlers shane s first appearance descending into a majestic valley rimmed by mountains shining a pearl handled sixshooter gun shane friendship with joe starrett cemented that evening as together they swing axes in common task to cut and pull up a large tree stump their energy battle filmed through the windows of the cabin and through the frantic kicking hooves of horses disturbed by their vicious struggle to determine who will go to town to face ryker s hired gun shane slow ride into town for a showdown the low tracking camera angle the darkness and the musical soundtrack emphasize shane s heroic yet lonely position on the horizon set among the wide view of the mountains certainly shane is a romantic film and yet it is full of integrity about time and place it may be interesting to compare the idealized interest attraction and love between shane and marion with the unspoken love between john wayne and dorothy jordan in the searchers in the latter film dorothy caresses wayne s army cape and is observed by ward bond who simply notices her gesture and looks away in shane marion implies her love for shane as she cautions her son joey about becoming attached to him in shane stevens combined so many elements that are classically required and combines them so well he directed shane with great feeling and turned it into a classic 
very inspirational i loved the portrayal of a tough honest lawman who also showed a deep understanding of human nature he was also a very warm family man the way he handled the young man who wanted to become his assistant and how he became a role model for him while he was alive is interesting i like certain westerns and this was a good one i think sam elliott should have been aged a little more it was too obvious that a young man was wearing props to make him look much older i recommend this feel good movie for a general audience 
at the show i was pleased with the dvd but disappointed that there were no behind the or deleted scenes included in the special features it is still one of my all time favorites 
boring plot but great characters i must admitt that this movie is hard to rate i love the evil witch belladonna who appears in this movie and i like that her cousin annabelle the pink whippet says more than lines the thing that takes this rating down would be the plot who hasn t heard the real christmas carol a thousand times already it s really just like all the rest with the characters from adgth i m a big fan of adgth i have a webisite on it too but the plot gets boring when you ve heard it a thousand times i give this movie stars out of five for characters and out of five for originallity go with which ever matters more 
best movie ever vampire journals is one of my all time favorites anything from full moon pictures is good the movie is very original i love the scenery the lighting the music everything the actors are perfect and i really enjoy the dialogue it s very old world movies that are filmed in eastern europe rock i love when zackery is telling sofia that bucharest is one of the cities of mysteries a city where the ways of antiquity exist in league with the modern world stuff like that is priceless 
excellent read i loved this book ! it is a very simple story on the surface but how the entire story is an allegory is fascinating i think that people can learn just as much about governments in our history if they read this book rather than staring at history text books ever since i ve read it i ve become very interested in the russian revolution and i want to learn more about how all of the characters in the book relate to real people i think the best thing about this book is that it teaches us a lesson and gives people a perfect example of how power corrupts 
one of the greatest episodes this was one of stargate sg s funniest episode ever you get to finally see the furlings for the first time too bad it took episodes and too bad they may not be real if you re a science fiction fan you ll love the burns that go around in this episode especially the star trek and farscape burns which were hilarious this is the perfect th episode for those loyal fans that stood by and watched every episode for the last decade 
if you build it she will come first of all i really need to ask what on earth was so bad about this movie this was quite simply the moulin rouge ! of the s the acting may have been a little cheezy but it wasn t all that great in moulin rouge ! either people need to understand that this is a musical and musicals aren t necessarily known for their great acting performances they are noted for their brilliant choreography songs and stage settings which i felt both moulin rouge and xanadu contained moreover the story in xanadu wasn t all that incoherent and reminded me a lot of field of dreams when kevin costner is inspired by a voice from an invisible muse to build a baseball field so while some of the criticism of this film is justified i feel much of it is not and it took way more of a beating than it should have one has to remember that there have been many films made which were raked over the coals by critics yet the films became enjoyed by many later on 
a classic from the firm i love this workout some of the other reviewers have mentioned that this is a little less intense than some of the other firms that is precisely the reason i love it so much it is very effective with less stress on your joints originally it was intended as a workout for the quotbaby boomers quot approaching middle age but really it is adaptable to all the lower body segment is killer if done with weights appropriate to your strength level but the aerobic segment is less intense than some i am but still run and workout to the other firms as well as gilad so i am in fairly decent shape but i can still feel the hover squats in this video ! the firm and gilad in my opinion have the best workout videos bar none they are not dancy or cutesy just good solid effective workouts with real results and isn t real results the reason we all do this in the first place btw i was just lucky enough to obtain another copy of this out of print video on e bay 
funniest couple this comedy is a classic it is not only the plot which is based on a play by neil simon but the cast makes this film a comedy that you will have a hard time to stop laughing the plot is well known a divorced man moves in with his bachelor friend and they became roomates from hell as i said you will laugh and laugh a lot jack lemon and walter matthau make a perfect duet and complement each other buy it 
bring in on all or nothing full screen received in factory sealed unopened condition and in time for christmas thanks 
when the past becomes the future a unique library of old and modern photographs are put under threat when the building they are housed in is suddenly sold the new owner of the property liam cunningham played by the able christopher anderson has no interest in the photos and doesn t care what happens to them in fact most of the photos will be destroyed with the crme de la crme of the collection being sold on all liam is interested in is renovating the building and making a hefty profit for the business he represents however the library s many eccentric employees won t give up without a fight and from then on a war of wits and determination is played out among a wonderful array of black and white photographs that represent the past the present and even the future the characters in this film are truly delightful especially timothy spall who plays the oddball oswald bates a man with a memory for faces so attuned that he can see resemblances between a person he has only seen once and those whose pictures are imprinted upon photographic paper however the battle to save the collection seems doomed with every attempt the library staff makes being thwarted but fate has something wonderful in store for liam cunningham and it is this wonderful twist in the story that ultimately will save the collection for future generations this is a fabulous film originally a three part series for the bbc in the late s i think it would have been a success if it had been released in art house cinemas all over the world a final pointer watch and listen out for the superb lindsay duncan who plays the diminutive marilyn truman the head librarian in the story she has the most amazing voice and when telling liam cunningham stories around certain photographs she captivates her audience to the point that you think that you are in the same room as her and liam a good musical score a sound cast wonderful photography and camera work shooting the past is a classic of a film that stephen poliakoff has every reason to be proud off look out for poliakoff s other masterpiece the lost prince both are worth having in your dvd video collection 
delightful sitcom bears ozu s depth and then some flatulence seems to be an odd way of lending a framework to a film but leave it to filmmaking master yasujiro ozu to use it as a metaphor for the meaninglessness of small talk between people who cannot be candid with one another the title of this movie ohay good morning is indeed the salutation but also from ozu s perspective a symbolic expression of how the japanese avoid confrontation and put a strong value on etiquette one of ozu s late period color films this is a very cute comedy which on the surface seems like an extended episode of leave it to beaver especially in exhibiting the speedy americanization of japan since wwii even the color palette seems to evoke the muted mccarthy era colors of the universal comedies release around the same time what remains consistent are ozu s signature visual compositions the use of the hillside to place the horizon in the middle of the frame the use of silhouettes against the hillside the movement of figures darting between the identical homes set in a shoebox tight housing community in tokyo the plot seamlessly interweaves the activities of five households four of the more traditional variety and the fifth a young beatnik couple who has the prized possession of the neighborhood a tv set which draws all the children in like clockwork after school in the meantime the housewives discover their association dues are missing and in peyton place style rumors swirl that the culprit is the woman who just bought a washing machine further subplots involve an unemployed english teacher who can only speak banalities to the woman he loves an older unemployed man who habitually gets drunk at the local bar and can t find his own home since they all look alike and the funniest about two young brothers the older particularly obstreperous in furiously sharing his all tooperceptive observations of the adults and practicing a strike of silence when their parents refuse to buy a tv set of course that doesn t prevent the brothers and their friends from playing competitive rounds of pull my finger a tap on the forehead yields a forced fart the performances are charming and quite undemanding with several members of ozu s regular troupe present chishu ryu and kuniko miyake the father and older son s wife in tokyo story as the put upon parents of the tv demanding brothers haruko sugimura the petty daughter in tokyo story as the accused dues pilferer and toyoko takahashi the onomichi neighbor in tokyo story as another of the gossipy housewives as the young people unable to articulate their feelings for each other keiji sada is the english teacher and yoshiko kuga is the boys shy aunt who couriers the documents for translation and as the brothers year old koji shitara plays minoru and seven year old masahiko shimazu is isamu the latter particularly adorable when mimicking his older brother this movie is certainly not in the class of tokyo story or floating weeds but i doubt if ozu intended it to be it s just a gentle well coordinated sometimes hilarious poke at japanese cultural traditions a parable masquerading as a family comedy personally this is the ozu film i can relate to the most since it speaks to my generation of japanese born americans the dvd package from the criterion collection is surprisingly sparse no audio commentary no trailer but the video transfer and sound quality are excellent 
a look forward into the past this film offers an intersting glimpse into what is starting to become commonplace years later a company is having models obtain plastic sugery to make them look as perfect as possible they scan the models into a computer and use thier digital likeness in commericals the film directed by michael crichton which was his first is very good and still holds up for today especially the graphics that were used on the display terminals for it being they still look somewhat cutting edge today the only gripe is that one must suspend all belief to think that a very young susan dey would want to be the girlfriend to a much much older albert finney 
not a classic but i like this movie i happen to like all of the main actors in this film ally sheedy phoebe cates virginia madsen and treet williams if you like them too perhaps you ll like this movie sure heart of dixie has its flaws i won t argue with the previous reviewer other than to say that a one star rating is awfully harsh this is not a civil rights movie in the way that ghosts of mississippi or mississippi burning is a civil rights movie it s more a coming of age story i enjoyed watching ally sheedy s character learn who she is and what she wants to become yep heart of dixie is lightweight yep it could have been done better and still i like it 
mock on more than years old now and a little dated spinal tap is still loads of fun with the mockumentary gang including christopher guest and michael mckean who did the delightful best in show in every aspect of s and s rock music is lampooned surprisingly director interviewer rob reiner comes off a little flat but maybe that s just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters big bottom a sendup of fat bottomed girls one of my politically incorrect favorites the sophisticated sex farm and the controversial smell the glove ultimately released as tap s black album are among taps big hits 
wall street wackiness the s were a time of unparalleled corporate greed or so the media told us then and now you had a bunch of workaholic young executives known as yuppies pounding the pavement in new york making complete fools out of themselves why because many of these dolts were the same ijits involved in the flower power movement a few years before you simply must hand it to the baby boomers never has a generation taken so much from so many and given back so little to so few by the time the s rolled around many of these cads turned up their sleeves and went about changing the corporate world thanks a lot largely due to the efforts of this generation we all have to jump through a lot more hoops to get and hold a job barbarians at the gate is a satirical look at just one aspect of the corruption the boomers helped bring to the work world namely the managed leveraged buy out although several of the principals in the film look much older than the boomers don t be fooled it was the total lack of morality of the post war generation that helped fuel the greed of the s this made for hbo film one of the best the channel ever created by the way stars james garner as nabisco rjr chief executive officer f ross johnson this is a guy who is a born salesman as the beginning of the film shows us when we see a youthful johnson selling photography sessions door to door by the time he has grown up he s running one of the biggest corporations in america selling cookies and smokes to people around the world in fact johnson s latest brainchild is the creation of a smokeless cigarette that promises to revolutionize the industry the possibility of huge profits from the new venture leads johnson to make an offhand comment about buying the company so he can hold on to most of the profits little does he know how easy it is to accomplish this goal his friends put him on to a fellow named henry kravitz jonathan pryce a corporate raider known for his skills in buying up companies and turning huge profits in the process johnson meets with henry but doesn t care for the guy that much for one thing kravitz is a bit on the cold side whereas ross is everyone s witty friend worse the nabisco executive gets the feeling that henry won t let him run the company the way he sees fit i e maintaining a huge fleet of corporate jets and posh expense accounts ross johnson decides to go ahead with his leveraged buy out without kravitz at the helm he contacts his old friend jim robinson jim thompson over at american express who in turn brings in hotshot financial whiz peter cohen peter riegert from the firm of shearson lehman to help finance the deal robinson s ingratiating wife and public relations guru linda joanna cassidy also lends a hand all the principals must keep quiet about what they plan to do though because kravitz and other sharks on wall street will jump into the fray if they get a whiff of johnson s ambitious intentions of course that s exactly what happens kravitz does discover the plan and makes it a personal crusade to force johnson out of the picture henry considers himself the father of the lbo and he s not about to let a bunch of upstarts steal his limelight he s got his own hotshots willing to work night and day in order to present a better offer for rjr nabisco stock to the company s board the majority of the film deals with the minutiae of back and forth backstabbing blatant greed under the table dealing and assorted other highly unethical business practices you ll be surprised to discover how suspenseful this film makes a leveraged buy out seem rarely have i seen a film that so successfully balances a message with fantastic humor great characters and high suspense the message of course is the unbridled greed of corporate america repeatedly these characters plot and plan to make a boatload of the green stuff while everyone else suffers the consequences layoffs don t mean a thing to these people as long as they can fill their pockets you should despise these people and you will at times but most of them possess endearing traits as well garner s depiction of johnson steals the show in this respect his witticisms outbursts and general grouchiness are hilarious to behold with none other than the scene where he discovers the utter failure of his smokeless cigarette serving as proof of this assertion i need an extra set of lungs to take a drag of this thing is the cleanest line i can mention from the exchange garner s just great and the primary reason i have watched this film at least a dozen times since it came out in the early s his overpowering presence tends to overshadow the great performances put in by jonathan pryce jim thompson and jeffrey demunn as one of ross s underlings at nabisco david rasche does a great job in the small but very funny role of ted forstmann an investment banker seeking to carve out his own niche in ross s deal i don t know what the problem is over at hbo but they consistently release their films to dvd with few to no extras at least barbarians at the gate comes with a widescreen picture transfer something i can t say for several other hbo releases i have rented lately if you love james garner or just adore films with a high entertainment value you must check out this obscure little gem soon do it for no other reason than to blow raspberries at that darned boomer immorality ! 
probably the best drama series ever made i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out 
worth watching for cast alone i am a hugh fan of robert newton made famous as long john silver in disney s treasure island seeing him in his younger days as would be tough guy bill walker was very interesting you can clearly see glimpses of his future characters such as long john silver bill sykes in oliver twist and so on having seen him mostly play rough guys it was aslo fun to see what a cutie his really is the film isn t the greatest but i would definatly recommend see it despite critics pointing out its cinematic weaknesses and plot flaws i am one of those people who simply watches a movie instead of analysizing the film to death and it is worth watching 
best in show is best in comedy this movie is a scream ! i laughed until i thought i was going to die comedy doesn t get any better than this the characters are incredible it s amazing the actors could keep straight faces while making this movie do yourself a favor and watch this movie ! it s even better the second time around 
oldies but goodies absolutely loved it i love any movie with judy garland in it 
must buy for x fans i viewed this years ago and purchased on a whim it is a must buy for any x or punk fan 
great history in the days before the batmobile when wayne manor was a large suburban neighborhood home can it get better than that 
rocket gibraltar it is a great movie i dont have to write much just buy it it is the type of movie that you smile and cry at the same time when your watching it 
magnificent the greatest story ever told is magnificent it has a classic sweep and splendor that lives up to its title while there are some questional interpretations and some scenes are unnecessarily plodding the performances are strong and the crowd scenes are often rousing filmed in utah the cinematography gives grandeur to match the film max von sydow provides a proper transcendence as jesus and charlton heston demonstrates both passion and prudent understatement as john the baptist honorable mention goes to telly savalas who gives the right ambiance to pilate furthermore judas s portrayal as the conflicted betrayor has a proper subtlety even if his lines don t always match the character i don t want the money the apostle known for robbing the common purse says sal mineo sidney poitier donald pleasance and a myriad of others also guest star even john wayne makes a token appearance as the centurion that can be measured in seconds making the greatest story the a bridge too far of christian cinema george stevens wrote directed and produced this epic his technical aspects solidify a masterful treatment however one could quibble with his directing for making it too tame in places and for his screenplay s discrepancies in another example martha chastises jesus but in the bible she says even now you could bring him lazarus to life while stevens interpretations substitute scripture in places the raising of lazarus jesus triumphal entry into jerusalem and his crucifixion give the spark of passion this venue deserves furthermore implementing handel s messiah in key scenes is a masterstroke all said and done the greatest story ever told is a reverent and relevant portrayal of jesus and his life 
one of the funniest movies ever if you have ever been involved in any sort of community or college theater you have got to see this film there is great truth in this fiction 
if this affected you do something seriously guys if this film says anything to you then it is your duty to do something these young men were wrongfully imprisoned im not saying you have to donate your college fund but atleast spread the word tell people about www wmorg tell people about wm awareness day july go to events tell everyone you know about this cause and while you are saying i don t have time for this remember that what is minutes to you could help these boys have minutes more of freedom seriously think about it 
mysterious magic or just a trick i have to say i was really skeptical about liking this movie because i thought the movie was about magic this movie is more of a love story with magic tricks being conducted by edward norton s character i really like this movie because it is mysterious and yet it has a love story going on as well edward norton did a very good job of playing the mysterious eisenheim the illusionist and the tircks he conducts are quite intresting this movie was also quite enjoyable because the lovely jessica biel plays eisenheim s love interest this was a very great movie because it has a love story mystery and magic this movie really makes you ask yourself is it magic or just an illusion

everyone was burnt by the sun of the bolshevik revolution clearly one of the most visually stunning intelligent sophisticated films about life in russia during the stalinist years burnt by the sun is an experience all lovers of fine filmmaking should see directed and starring nikita mikhalkov who also co wrote the screenplay with rustam ibragimbekov this film allows us entry into the inside stories of russia under stalin it is an emotionally devastating tale on the grounds of his dacha in revolutionary hero colonel kotov nikita mikhalkov cavorts in his sauna with his young daughter nadya nadezhda mikhalkova and his elegantly beautiful young wife marusia ingeborga dapkunaite outside on the lawn is the rest of kotov s family in a peaceful sun drenched summer garden drinking singing and blissfully enjoying life in the country on the vast horizon is a group of men assembling a balloon to honor stalin and a group of army tanks treads onto the wheat fields threatening to destroy the crops the townsfolk workers run for kotov to rescue the situation underlining the fact the kotov is their hero from the revolution much loved and respected abruptly onto the scene comes the handsome young cousin dimitri mitya oleg menshikov an ex lover of kotov s wife he ingratiates himself with nadia and the rest of the family as a pianist and singer but there is a note of evil lurking kotov understands the threat that mitya s arrival indicates that he has been betrayed and has become one of the many to be purged by stalin but the life in the dacha remains leisurely and elegant until the fateful end when mitya s mission is fulfilled the film ends with phrases telling us about the destinies of kotov and his family up to the end of the purge after stalin s death the story is history the telling is art blest with a cast of extraordinary luminosity nikita mikhalkov directs this tale of repression with style and leisurely pacing such as allowing for moments at table when one of the grandmothers sings an aria from puccini s madama butterfly an aria whose text foreshadows the future of the story it is this contrast between the residual classy elegance of russia before the revolution and the gritty reality of the cruelty of stalinism that makes the film so resonant the cinematography by vilen kalyuta and the musical score by eduard artemyev enhance the film immeasurably in russian and french with english subtitles highly recommended grady harp march 
superb backbeat is an excellent portrayal of the hamburg phase of the early beatles and succeeds on every level although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of fifth beatle stuart sutcliffe the focus quickly shifts to john lennon who as in real life dominated the music and lives of the early beatles it is as much the story of stu and john as the story of stu and astrid and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships still it is a fascinating look at the early beatles who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough reeperbahn bars in the pre fame years the cast is excellent and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed the music is also excellent and complements the story perfectly in all backbeat is an entertaining journey through the world of the early beatles and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings 
corny corny corny great film we dust this off every year during super bowl week an excellent choice for the chick flick section of your collection and as any husband can tell you it doesn t hurt to have a lot of chick flicks on hand 
a fast paced different type of thriller minutes is worth the money it probably will not be the number one dvd in your collection but you re sure to go back and watch it from time to time this film gives an interesting if not frightening look at the role mass media play in our country s daily life we don t think about it since we are living it but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today at the center of the movie s plot is a greedy slick breaking news style anchor who is given the gift of being the only personality in town to have the near realtime footage of a string of murders as they are being committed he has a moral pause only for a second before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world the rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them all in all not the best movie out there but worth the money 
shocking and unforgettable admittedly i rented this out because of goran visnjic being in it but that wasnt the main reason as the opening scene unfolded i could see that this wasnt a film for the faint hearted that on the way to a wedding the mother of the bride is shot dead with the film progressing and the character of risto visnjicbecoming more important i felt myself being drawn into what was happening and could not help but be moved by the scenes of the orphanage to see how these children had been mixed up in a war that led them to losing their parents had me in tears whilst not an entertaining film i thought that it was well worth watching as it gave an insight no matter how small into what people had to go through the acting was great and only enhanced what was a brilliant film but one that left me shocked and upset 
good hd film i got this to see what a wmvhd film looks like on an hdtv and it looks great it s not very long but the footage of the blue angels is pretty cool i would reccomend this to anyone who loves fast jets and to anyone who wants to showcase their hd setup 
the very best of its so bad it s good yes you can come home when patty duke belts out her first song you just know this is going to be gawd awful good her twitchy body coupled with an out ofkey voice is a hoot and not to give anything away for the newbies but you will be on the floor when she sings in the sanitarium this is a beautiful looking movie the colors shine the sound is terrific john williams gets the only academy award for original score what no dion warwick for theme from valley of the dolls i was surprised there was no nomination the trivia track yes there is a track filled with trivia mentions an issue of the song released for radio a different version and the one played on movie maybe an issue here there is a commentary track by barbara parkins but i was disappointed that there was only one voice from the movie it would have been better if there could have been a couple more there are many extras many of which i haven t seen yet a nice package of extras this had to be a career destroying movie only lee grant and john williams seemed to come out unscathed and susan hayward what was she thinking as the star among stars she actually looks like the only actor in the movie but her laughable stage and singing performance scenes along with the obligatory female cat fight with the patty duke character keeps this movie rolling in schlock this movie is filled with past and future academy award winners grant duke hayward williams and martin milner just kidding and watch for an appearance by richard dreyfus no less towards the end of the movie this is a star movie for the genre dreamy scenery bad dialog and soundtracks outstanding cast doing their best to make this awful a decent title track song by warwick sex and have i mentioned drugs enjoy 
informative nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties 
swiss family robinson cd it was great fun it helps to read the book first so that one can imagine before disney presents their version 
minute thrill ride i am laughing at those star reviews saying how avp is destroying the alien and predator legacy because of its nonexistent plot all i am going to say is this go back and watch alien and p again before passing any judgment i did recently both has even less of a story than avp both would be receiving mediocre reviews if released today those star reviewers are comparing avp to how they remember alien and predator memories are doing a real number on them the only thing that avp lacks is originality however the story will continue avp sets the stage for sequels we should wait and see how it develops meanwhile enjoy the incredible cg and action sequences in short avp is an awesome minute thrill ride that i am willing to take again and again and for the record paul anderson is a great director check out his resident evil as another side note james cameron ranked avp as the rd best among the alien movies after alien and his aliens 
beauty and the beast the tv series i don t understand why this series has never been released on dvd although i could never understand why it went off the air in the first place when they continue to keep other shows on that is just not worth watching year after year there were a lot of people that fought to keep it on and they lost this series really needs to be released another generation of movie watchers need to be introduced to it please release it soon i have been waiting year after year ! come on amazon get it release by the studio ! you can do it

the true story of an outstanding soldier audie murphy s screen autobiography is a much better film than it has any right to be the army provides a depression era kid from east texas with a strong family structure that he has never really experienced in a young audie murphy played by gordon gebert as a boy by murphy himself later is forced to become the head of a family with an ailing mother and an absent father he drops out of grade school and goes to work full time to provide for his younger siblings until at roughly the same time world war ii starts and his mother dies by enlisting in murphy can provide more money for his brothers but neither the navy nor the marines were interested in the small guy in the army murphy is promoted to corporal on the troop ship carrying him overseas where he joins the rd infantry division b company th regiment it soon becomes apparent that the likable baby face kid hardly old enough to shave has a genuine aptitude for soldiering after north africa his outfit takes part in the invasions of sicily anzio and southern france in every engagement murphy steps up and excels as a soldier at the same time he becomes friends with brandon charles drake johnson marshall thompson and kerrigan jack kelly he sees himself as part of a unit and everything that he does is meant to advance the unit not the individual murphy liked to work alone putting only himself at risk the one long scene that moves away from the military an interlude in an italian town where he meets maria susan kohner and her family is embarrassingly bad as long as the focus stays on the platoon s activities on the battlefield the film is in fine shape director jesse hibbs makes the cold mud and rain of the italian campaign believably real especially a series of scenes revolving around a farmhouse and a burning tank one might assume that murphy s indomitable courage would be described as rambo like heroics but in comparing the film with the official combat reports it is clear that murphy became an astounding soldier by skill training intelligence and luck he was an equal opportunity soldier doing everything the front line combatant is required to do in order to take and hold ground through sicily italy france and into germany all of the events recounted in the film take place before murphy was years old in that brief military career audie l murphy becomes one of the best fighting combat soldiers of the last century he never really seemed to care about the medals or glory just the men of his unit and friends who fall down in the european theater of operations murphy died tragically on may when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into a mountain near roanoke virginia he was his last film role was earlier that year playing jesse james in a time for dying

such a fine movie harvey fierstein s play that won a tony translates beautifully onto the screen even though the movie is only two hours long the play was about four he captures the essence of this groundbreaking play although we previously had had boys in the band the staircase and similar plays movies about gay people in america no writer before had said that i can recall that gays should adopt children gays should be monogamous gays should be honest with themselves their families and everybody else gays had nothing to be ashamed of gays were good people fierstein says all that and more in this most seminal work when the history of the gay movement in the late th century is written this play movie will be remembered with the likes of angels in america as lasting art i saw the play on broadway years ago it was the shortest four hours of my life both the play and the movie will make you laugh they will make you cry of course fierstein who both wrote the screenplay and plays arnold beckoff a ka virginia ham gets a tad dramatic at times and his addressing the audience works better on stage than in the film and maybe the great actress anne bancroft overacts as his b y mother these are just table crumbs however from a magnificent visual feast all the actors to a person are superb and the soundtrack is worth owning fierstein who sings his songs live has a voice no lower than marlene dietrich s and just as good fierstein also does a commentary on the dvd of this film offering interesting insights and tidbits about the making of torch song trilogy a film you will want to see again and again 
understanding death i was thrilled when i discovered this gem on a cable tv movie channel i recorded it because i was fairly certain there would not be a second chance it was sweet it was amusing but most of all it was forbidden or so i thought since then i ve found a select group of fans it wasn t horrific or disgusting to me i like unusual movies and this was well done in my opinion just because this culture has no sense of a spirituality that is a necrophiliac s sexual delight doesn t make it gross or dirty 
what a character robert evans has had a more interesting life than any character in his movies and that is no small feat considering evans is the man who produced love story chinatown the godfather and many other blockbusters and classics this film is a fantastic portrait of an almost incredible man one that anyone even those who are not particularly interested in hollywood will enjoy a spectacular documentary ! highly recommended 
obsessive obsession to love that deeply that you constantly obsess about every aspect of your lover s life is maddening literally this couple appears to have a bond way beyond this earth the heat generated by them almost melts the screen this is a wonderful torrid love story 
may i give it stars i loved harvey from the moment i saw torch song on screen i ve been a fan of honesty sincereity and courage and downright humanity since being exposed to his brilliance i m an undying fan since this story should be an eye opener to those who discriminate against anyone however subtly for whatever reason sexuality religion national origin or even if one is black poor and from new orleans and don t have bus fare to escape hurricane katrina denial kills ive waited long enough for this to come out on dvd i am buying my copy now ! 
so entertaining ! way to go ! very light hearted fun you d want to live in the s with a film like this a bit of rock n roll love a mad scientist a bully included to spice things up a little on occasion due to success or failure people disappear or reappear in michael s not the name of his character family photo s and has to set the record straight so his father will fall in love with his mum not michael otherwise he won t exis in the future only the alien creature that he uses to scare his father the whimpy teen reinforces the idea in his mind to marry michael j fox s mother the stereotypes are silly but enjoyable the plot is easy to follow and you have sense of affinity with the doc and michael j fox s role any back to the future movie is good no is my favorite though but the most obvious thing to do is to follow them in chronological order ! even though i didn t find out about these movies like that if you like sci fi like hitchhicker s guide to the galaxy which is more open to it s audience that it is a comedy you ll like this if you like lost in space which is not very a very serious sci fi series you ll like this too just fun fun fun it sucks how michael has parkinson s disease now ! when you look at these movies and one may think that when seeing these movies but see him for who he was in his prime and pray to elohim he gets better these days for someone who always preferred to star in comedy like role movie or serial 
the best historical war drama from the far east i have seen many historical war dramas from far east mainly china s and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions and the second guessing nature of the king which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes whether on sea or land are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have episodes i don t know why it stops at if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley s imjin war which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull s samurai invasion which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly now in gold version

the beginning of feature documentary filmmakin this is a glimpse into an amazing way of life which for the most part no longer exists the filmmaker was an explorer before he became a filmmaker so great care is taken to tell these people s story through the example of one main character nanook the bear i was pleased at how well this work has been preserved and transfered to the new medium of dvd if you are interested in the arctic region anthropology history or even great adventure you will enjoy nanook of the north

heres yum heres the other yum and here s yum yum ball of fire is one my favorite screwball romantic comedies it was made towards the end of a golden era of this genre of films which also includes such better known classics as the philadelphia story his girl friday and bringing up baby directed by howard hawks the master of rapid fire comedic dialogue it tells the story of nerdy language scholar bertram potts gary cooper in one of his best awshucks performances along with mr deeds goes to town who lives in a house with seven other stodgy albeit older bachelor scholars all of whom are working on an encyclopedia upon discovering that his knowledge of slang is outdated potts bravely ventures forth into the real world where he discovers flashy literally as the dress she is first seen in is sequined and purposely lit so as to momentarily blind potts when she shows up at his house in it nightclub singer katherine sugar puss o shea barbara stanwyck he is taken in by o sheas gusty performance of drum boogie accompanied by a famous drummer of the times gene krupa who reminds me onstage a bit of the who drummer keith moon and her lively banter and asks her to help him with his slang research she takes him up on his invitation very abruptly by showing up at his home that same night claiming to be arriving to help when in fact she s trying to hide the resulting storyline is predictable fast paced extremely well written thoroughly dated and filled with s slang in other words to anyone who is a fan of this genre completely captivating and charming with this in mind and taken as a movie of the times it s a comedic gem gary cooper my all time personal favorite actor is absolutely sexy here believe it or not and barbara stanwyck is perfect as the title s sassy little ball of fire with her brash streetwise exterior but ultimately soft heart climbing onto a stack of books to reach the potts so she can show him the meaning of yumyum also the above mentioned dress she first wears which is featured in most of the ads for the film is amazing it s something bob mackie might have designed for cher and she looks gorgeous in it the outstanding supporting parts are interesting clever and except for the gangster parts individually well fleshed veteran character actors such as oskar homolka the servant in mr sardonicus and henry travers the angel in its wonderful life help lend charm to the story dana andrews laura and dan duryea the little foxes are effective if somewhat wasted in small parts as typical sterotypical s mobsters youd have to enjoy these kind of old screwball dated comedies of the s to love this one and i do side note the roles of the seven professors excluding cooper s were inspired by disney s dwarfs from snow white and the seven dwarfs 
god said to abraham kill me a son the wind is in the thorn tree yep there is nothing exceptional to this rambo formula remake they use all the same clich they probably recycles some of the old rambo blood and bullets now you ask why we should watch the rambo rehash well i ll tell you because instead of richard crenna you get tommy lee jones and most of his facial expressions when they are not being hidden behind blood and hair and instead of sylvester stallone who was very good in oscar you get benicio del toro who can look more like a man betrayed than an old boxer the story is as old as the hills l t bonham tommy lee jones is called out of retirement to track down a mysterious person or persons unknown that killed some hunters the person turns out to be a soldier aaron hallman benicio del toro that he trained to kill through a series of mishaps aaron gets loosed and the inept authorities must compete with l t for the retrieval or destruction however l t knows he is to only one to do it so does aaron get away so he can kill again does l t make his first kill or is he really a pusssy catdo the inept authorities realize their limits before it is too late do we come away with any new insights
