no need to suicide i get the story line but grown women need to suicide the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself it is not matching the character 
horrible horror flick friday the th spawned a whole new subgenre called slasher flicks this was not a positive development for with the new sub genre came a brand new cookie cutter formula that subsequent slasher flicks have rigidly adhered to friday the th has an absurd premise in that it concerns the re opening of camp crystal lake years after its closure there are members of the community who are aware of evil plottings being aimed at camp crystal lake and its denizens such as a truck driver and a local lunatic named crazy ralph camp crystal lake opens up and it turns out that just about everyone who shows up both counselors and campers alike are nothing but a bunch of perverts who apparently deserve being slaughtered at the hands of a demented maniac friday the th is an awful flick in almost every regard unlike almost all of the pre horror movies friday the th and the slasher flick sub genre that it spawned is not with the victims these poor excuses for movies are with the killers and the whole point is for the audience to anticipate the next murder or killing spree slasher flicks like friday the th are movies to avoid like the plague 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
the brat pack and those enormous granny panties this was the movie that gave us the brat pack a staple of a certain s cultural set the term brat pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in st elmo s fire on a boozy night of partying since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren t in the movie anthony michael hall for example suffered a bit of a ripple effect here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl s bedroom wall out of all the dramedies of the john hughes movies this was the one i liked the least maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college it was trying to be the next generation graduate movie and i didn t relate when my time came maybe it had to do with the fact that i have been let down by many people and didn t have that network of friends in similar situations and the isolation i felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia i guess i was just a little more bitter plus as my life was surrounded by work and little else i didn t have all the dramas going on they did that was kind of sad the one scene where rob lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team it proves you really can t go home again and there are some clinging to the past not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties this caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset it s not a bad story but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold 
john voight must have needed the paycheck his tom landry impersonation is worse than geno hackman s replacements and gil bellows is supposed to be doug flutie thats who this movie was originallysupposed to be about i hear flutie ball got a paycheck on this one too they stole the money since it s sortof about douglas richard flutie i llgive it a merciful out of fivesince amazon coms rating scale islamost as liberal as hitlery clinton 
embarrassing why did they even bother transferring this movie to dvd seriously the child of a masterpiece the vanishing sports some of the most half hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the sthis isn t a matter of comparison this movie all by itself just sucks if i hadn t seen the original i d just think what a brilliant plot too bad they decided to bury it no pun intended with everything else in the movie jeff bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great gut wrenchingly disturbing hitchcockian movie sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are themselves which add nothing to the movie and the ending oh the ending we ve been cheated totally cheated all the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of it has to be upbeat hollywood cornball syndrome sandra bullock is rescued the villain is hit with a shovel and everything is a ok even though kiefer sutherland s original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated this is of a great movie 
ok but not great i saw him live in when he was hot and hoped this would be a great reminder of his hilarious sense of humor and delivery but it was far too short only minutes and only had a couple of good routines my hopes were higher than what this delivered ! the bonus material was taken from vegas when he was near the end and it really was not very funny i would recommend looking at another dvd of his rather than purhcase this one 
so many gaps in the story this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he s suffered in cuba and that s about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what s going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it s trying to convey it s lost in the plotless story 
stupidity i ve never given one star to any type of produce before but the stupidity of this dvd and its fans are shocking so revealing ! so true ! if you didn t know fast food was unhealthy give me a break if you think this is realistic give me a break supersize me is a piece of propaganda meant to turn people away from eating mcdonalds food the film documents morgan spurlock embarking on a perilous quest to eat three meals of mcdonalds per day this diet has rules too whenever he is asked if he wants a meal to be super sized he must do it he also much try each item on the menu at least once he is only allowed to consume items that are in fact on the menu the thing is though if he is really trying to make a valid point why does he order the double quarter pounder with cheese meal twice within the first seven days this is questionable because not only is this the most fatty item on the menu it also made him vomit the first time that he ate it all the thing is though millions of people some skinner than spurlock have this meal and do not throw up why him his wife is a vegan chef and he is used to having no meat in his diet so why would he choose the biggest item on the menu twice in the first week there are many many other items that he couldn t possibly been able to cover not only that he almost gets no exercise during the month of this experiment saying that the average american gets little exercise his laziness seems to be an exaggeration there is some merit to the movie showing people how unhealthy mcdonalds is but everyone knows that they just don t care for spurlock to in any way even the subtlest of ways to support the idiots who sue the fast food chains because they became obese is ludicrous it should be mentioned that wendy s regular hamburger is a quarter pounder while mcdonalds regular burger is th of a pound also wendy s goes up to a triple quarter pounder something mcdonalds has never done burger king introduced the triple cheese burger and quadrouple cheese burger something mcdonalds has never done it seems that mcdonalds is picked as a scapegoat because it is the most popular this movie may have been more credible if it examined the dangers of fast food as a whole but just to go up against the one corporation is stupid if the movie didn t suggest that the corporation doesn t care about it s customers i wouldn t have a problem but it does too much of anything especially food is bad for someone if anyone needed a movie to tell them that fast food is unhealthy they clearly are seeing the world through a filter 
the mothman travesty three problems with this film pacing the film s pacing doesn t vary it s very boring as a matter of fact this wouldn t be a problem if the film were much more tense eg speed however this film lacks the high action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed effects too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions and there is an overabundance of high speed imaging the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling horror scenes furthermore they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film s plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole the upshot the film relies too heavily on the art of editing to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting triviality the plot s conclusion quails in the face of the so what question the viewer is left with a sense of i sat through the film for that in light of points and this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake dont waste your life alon 
take it off the rack and it s wack put it back i don t know what s up with all of these star reviews this movie was awful there was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag not even the guest appearances by afrika bambataa melle mel and the rock steady crew could save it i couldn t wait for it to be over with the graffiti throughout the movie was absolutely awful ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair guy davis was fine back then but not anymore rae dawn chong was just annoying this is one movie i never want to see again 
not the worst movie ever made first of all this is not the worst movie ever made nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars the worst movie ever made was autumn in new york but that is a different review no this not a great movie but it is very interesting and for once thank god it doesn t end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie bleak more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing for molly ringwald she didn t do anything of note again until the stand six years later and for andrew mccarthy well it could be argued that he still hasn t starred in anything of note again although he probably made some money from weekend at bernies i ii anyway probably better to rent than buy i am only buying it to complete my s collection 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
low budget the plot and its development are extremely weak acting is marginal and special effects are questionable what can i say i love scifi have a thing about time travel flicks and enjoy punishing myself with b rated scifi movies if you re looking for quality entertainment then this is not the choice for you if you re a nut about scifi go for it bro 
travesty an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse worst of the worst abc afterschool specials if you had not read the book you would be unable to follow what was happening some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time the original evil dead with all its flaws is a better put together film than this one this movie is flat out painful to watch you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do it all seems so random read the book if you see this movie in a rental store just move along please nothing to see here 
what s the worth in it my month old son loves the baby einstein series they ve been the only movies to hold his attention the sounds and music get his attention the shapes and colors hold it that said this movie never got or held his attention there are no interesting sounds or music the voices are very monotone while i understand the intention of this video if you don t catch the attention of the child what s the worth in it the pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said i also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages but foreign cultures if i knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited i could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool all around this move was disappointing 
a promise is a promise it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment considering the makeup of the cast nicolas cage bridget fonda and rosie perez among others the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning million dollars on the ny state lotto decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day the acting is surprisingly below average the dialogues are way below average while the plot is not bad at all nicolas cage s character is too naive and too slow and that was just sad pitifulbridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland rosie perez s character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing they don t seem to belong subsequently they are not convincing in their roles at all finally somebody shoot the narrator please though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really no masterpiece here if nicolas cage is what you had in mind check out the amazing movies city of angels and or the family man 
bad director bad god this movie was lame i mean it was lame it limped it struggled it staggered i lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes the really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gonna get killed check the sleazeball guy getting killed check the sleazeball guy practically begging for death here doggie that s eighty minutes of my life i ll never get back 
very boring i ve been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo i m just happy i waited untill it came on tv i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it the romance was slim to none i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role well i won t say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it anyway i would much rather watch beautiful thing get real all over the guy the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love 
free to be you and me as long as you are like me i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my s days in elementary school this video made its rounds in the public schools the songs are catchy and the film quality is good but make no mistake this is propaganda aimed at children i will not be showing it to my kids despite the freewheeling title the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys case in point atalanta a princess finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world on her father s horse she also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of ladies first the tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron the narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal our hosts infant puppets voiced by mel brooks and marlo thomas are revolting there should be a law against using mel brooks voice for a baby apparently i repressed memories of these creatures but seeing them again brought back the horror needless to say i fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry overall this dvd is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
forsake your dearly departed or you ll be sorry b grade movie really poor script bulk of movie is boring superficial stereotypical real purpose of movie is baptist condemnation of the supernatural story line the wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit the husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife on the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life overtonesthe leading man is depicted as unstable self centered reckless irresponsible and fantasy pronebefore and during the two year period when revealed to the those assembled the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned his giving up the ghost is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life the daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head on crash with a car leaving her frightened and distraught media messages the film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo spirit contact is dangerous selfish and emotionally unhealthy the personal grieving journey of another should be co opted by peers condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact there should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like what did she look like what kinds of things did she say messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted in short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones in life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us in passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond when william blake s brother passed he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all many near death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves the inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds the same is true for after death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film 
beware ! this dvd isn t widescreen dear film company jackasses surely you know we already hate you for your greed why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like the great santini and cutting them to full screen yet another fine film marred no doubt by some big company s desire to cut corners burn hollywood burn 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
attempts to be provokative turns out ultra violent gore the ideas behind minutes aren t bad at all take one robert deniro put him in new york mix him with some american dream hunting eastern europeans on a killing spree and try to provoke some emotions and have a sly dig at the american justice system lets see nothing happened only repulse if like everyone else you plan on watching this film because deniro is in it you will be dissapointed he puts in a tired performance almost as if he knows the film is a load of b s the attempt to be hard hitting goes horribly wrong instead it s just repulsive over the top violence and its pointless naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces why there are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning such as mm the horrible subject of snuff movies hard hitting meaningfull film minutes is far from meaningfull we all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that but when converting it to a film it needs a deeper meaning otherwise it turns into melodramatic hollywood if you like brain dead gore and violence lack of plot and cringing melodrama go ahead 
would give stars if i could the unbox video version of this film for tivo is useless only after purchasing it did i discover that this film can only be downloaded to a tivo a certain number of times in a certain time period for more than the cost of the dvd i m restricted in when where and how i can watch this movie nothing like being treated like a criminal by the movie studios i will not purchase another tivo unbox film 
not so super in an era of batman begins sin city spiderman and it s easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn t a sure thing for an example of a spectacular misfire spawn comes to mind the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually felt like you were watching a comic book complete with isolated panels minimal movement and jarring transitions between scenes one moment spawn s threatening some guy and the next he s standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind similarly superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go the iconic scenes of superman basking in the sun s rays or hovering about the earth listening for crime or when he s actually doing something heroic which happens far too infrequently fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot for example supermans been gone for years one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot nope lex luthor has discovered superman s fortress of solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized kryptonite surely that means superman won t even be able to get near the place right nope once said continent shows up it s clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable this is lex s big plan to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for people to call him and offer him money or something surely he must have more up his sleeve nope heck the world s changed a lot since superman s been gone right wouldn t it make sense to really pound home how different earth is with it s global warming crazy politics and pop starlets nope instead the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of superman with his cell phone thats right the kid scooped the daily planet with just his camera phone ! isn t that wacky superman returns is very much a movie in love with the original and while visually faithful it s a very poor imitation yes brandon routh looks like a spitting image of christopher reeves but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks kate bosworth is far too young and whiny as lois lane jimmy olsen sam huntington still wears a bowtie for some reason and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable even the amazing kevin spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish lex luthor jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie s climax the pacing is all wrong superman saving lois from a plane crash is great superman fighting criminals with belt fed chain guns is excellent superman drowning superman moping superman frustrated over lois lane superman convalescing in a friggin hospital not great superman returns has its moments and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured but then it s gone and the movie drags and drags and drags superman has been co opted to be a christ like father son parable and on the way bryan singer forgot what made the first superman movie so great it was fun i could have made a better movie with my camera phone 
guess you have to be stoned i don t expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained i don t seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in depth critique it s only a movie i either enjoy it or i don t i did not enjoy this and i ride so i assumed i would like this i guess you have to ride and use drugs to appreciate this 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
just not gripping admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it s moments of entertainment but overall it s long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this didn t do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman s silent scientific discoveries completely amusing couldn t wait for the movie to end honestly 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
one of elvis worst movies i ve seen all of elvis movies most several times this is one of the worst only stay away joe and harem scarem are worse i usually watch every elvis movie every time it comes on tv but not these three 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
what s love got to do with it women in love is a well acted film mostly about people who are difficult to like doing things difficult to approve to its great credit this ken russell film is faithful to the d h lawrence novel upon which it is based 
ugh what drivel i m a big mann fan and i even enjoy his not very good non noir or western films thunder bay for instance a great director but this one stinks i can t even get up the enthusiasm to criticise i 
this is a comedy seriously i didn t even think that this was a comedy until i came here and saw people saying it wasn t funny i got it as part of a boxed set of cary grant films purchased here and it s the only dud of the lot there was one scene that i will grant you was light and entertaining not laugh out loud but funny enough i won t spoil it by saying which one aside from that the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity most of all you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne grant and simmons in particular are strong but their efforts are ultimately squandered bob mitchum is ok but generally miscast and kerr s beauty and talent are basically wasted no amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here she goes from happily married to tramp in about minutes for no discernible reason overall acting c grantsimmons b directing fwriting d i understand that this film caters more to english tastes and that s fine but i found it most un satisfying 
don t waste your time boring and woody allen will drive you insane he never stops talking 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
do the twisted i think when many say they knew after minutes who the killer was they re actually saying they guessed who the killer was and just happened to be right think about this for a moment what was the motive that was something i never figured out the killer didn t have a motive that s what threw me off but i guess some would say a crazed killer doesn t need a motive but come on ! even the deranged killer in even had a reason for killing even norman bates had a reason for killing it could be the reason was explained but i just missed it because the movie was so terrible i don t know i really don t want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out i know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles one of them is the killer for sure but you re thrown off by the fact that you have andy garcia d w moffett and sam l jackson so all are fair game 
very dissapointed i was very disappointed with this film it definitely had a more art house feel to it than i was expecting and like happens with many art house films sebastiane is light on plot and character development and heavy on scenery shots bad string music and slow motion nude shots but alas not even erotic ones the real story of sebastiane is a fascinating one how does such a man transform into the much beloved st sebastiane of the catholic church well don t expect this movie to tell you there is as mentioned above no character development we are given an off handed explanation that sebastiane s faith christianity was the cause of his eventual execution but any scenes of faith are oddly intertwined with a lot of roman flavored philosophical ideas references to roman gods and so forth very un catholic so while we know that it was sebastiane s faith that lead to his execution this plot line is really dulled down to the point that there is no plot the other men on the island are nothing more than pretty bodies to look at their characters do not get developed at all the interaction conflict between sebastiane and the roman guard could have been so much more interesting and potent if jarman had fleshed out that character a little more also disappointing was that the eroticism of this film falls miserably flat now i realize that i am a female and this is a gay movie but i would like to think that i am as aroused by sexy nude men as much as any gay man would be well i was not aroused there are plenty of shots of nude men but the way that jarman shot the film is so stylized and stiff that it takes all the eroticism out of it i watched a slow motion scene of two nude men splashing in the surf and all i could think was gay men are actually turned on by this well this straight woman was bored about half way through the movie so my advice is don t buy this movie for it s story line or it s erotic value there is none of either 
not good very weak and inept as love story or as thriller though i like rachel leigh cook and like her turn as a sulky but really sweet girl in shes all that and love to see her in anywhere you name it tangled is a wrong choice as a thriller it is not intriguing as a love story it is too familiar and the story is as the film says too tangled to take it seriously it is about a love triangle that got tangled david shawn hatsey alan jonathan rhys meyers and jenny rachel leigh cook all juniors at a college jenny and david are seeing each other when alan handsome and reckless steps into their college life out of the blue quiet boy david who studies poetry and alan were in fact friends when much younger but because of some incidents in the past their relations was an awkward one and because of jenny s ambiguous attitudes to alan and alan s seductive attitudes to jenny things get more complicated and more dangerous thats what the opening of the film implies by the choppy shots of flashbacks the film follows the memories of david who now hospitalized after some still unknown terrible accident recounts his story before the investigator lorraine bracco so here the film also tries to give a twist to the otherwise mundane story using flashbacks that slowly reveals the key events in the past the original intention is good and there is a decent film buried behind the film which i am afraid no one in english speaking coutries have seen in theater there are some good shots that suggest the emotional tense between the characters and rachel leigh cook is as sweet as before and sexy at times but unbelievably the film takes almost one hour to explain the relations between the three which is not particularly original and after that it drifts into the revelation of the facts in the style that faintly resembles rashomon but what can you do in thirty minutes with that format when you need more time to present the shifting viewpoints that challenge our perception of reality my overall reaction to tangled was like what happened to rlc she is as busy as before as far as i can see her filmography on internet but living in japan i hear about less and less please no more this or get carter or antitrust by the way estella warren appears but her role is very small and her turn is not very outstanding sorry 
great book bad movie good actors my view is skewed i was in va and flew with steve oonts a few times as a b n his book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the aa intruder into the public eye people would tell me about their experiences while reading the book they did not know my connection to it steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin while the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port it did not convey the excitement of the book so i was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try w stewart tittle lt usnr 
great movie horrible dvd buena vista the company that releases disney films on dvd chose to not release anamorphic dvds when they first came to dvd so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced this means if you have a widescreen television you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture also these discs are absolutely barebones only featuring a dolby soundtrack and a widescreen presentation where are the extras i don t know about you guys but i am a mighty duck fan who is disappointed by the dvd release of this film 
that breeze ain t an open window not that i know everything about crime especially getting away with it but a shock to the system made it look too easy performances by michael caine as a done wrongnowdoinwrong angry executive and will patton as the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on television but a shock to the system needed to close a few holes in its story to make it worthy of your movie theater home video payment 
terrible i could not sit through this movie the acting and screenplay are terrible this film could be described as a bad made fortv movie at best i ended up fast forwarding though the entire movie after the first minutes and turned the player off before i reached the end i couldn t take it anymore this movie is one of the worst i ve attempted to watch in a long time not recommended 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet

paris when it stinks i m a fan of audrey hepburn and this movie relys heavily too heavily on her charm and unfortunately it is some of her worst acting work posey sing song and superficial now if you ve read her bio and know what was going on with her and holden that could explain it but still this film is very static like most heburn films a highlight is her clothes her style her self this film self consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better there are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here this film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead jayne mansfield could have been a hoot in this thelma ritter too in a very different way somebody with less style and more off beat snap crackle and pop thelma ritter and william holden paired in a romantic comedy i m all ready laughing ! before i hit this too harshly this film was intended to be a trifle the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles for that it is adequate the remake alex and emma suffers very much from the same problems they actually improved the script and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices but both films seem to have suffered from settling for a star when a less mainstream more zany actress was needed ok this doesn t stink it has audrey but it certainly doesn t sizzle 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download 
once again a king story is ruined on film in the short story collection night shift mr king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least movies that i know of this mess trucks twice once by king as maximam overdrive and once as a t v movie night surf the boogyman not the new one graveyard shift the mangler and maybe more and not one has been done right ! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve he who walks behind the rows more like we steped in something behind the rows and we steped in this flameing piece of junk skip it 
good basis this film is an integral one in the study of film adaptation of jane austen s most popular novel pride and prejudice it represents the beginning of a serious love affair between film and austen novels however it is not great in terms of adaptation if you love pride and prejudice and have never seen this film skip it it will only anger you if you re studying film adaptation of austen novels you must see this one as it has influenced everything that came afterwards and its laurence olivier afterall 
spalding where are you the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i don t like about this film its narcissism it s gray s defining characteristic after a while despite jonathan demme s fabulous direction he makes the best of a limited repertoire it just gets boring 
couldn t get past the animation not entertaining the animation is creepy i don t get it 
better not shown i imagine this movie might be funny if you re really into dog shows i m not so i couldn t tell you mediocre at best this is spinal tap was better 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
ed wood eat your heart out i love movies i hate this one every melodramatic gimmick known to s tv movies is packed in tight my favorite one is when one of the kids gets free long enough to pick up the gun but is just too emotional to shoot his captor the captor is yelling shoot me ! come on but he just can t he s too busy hamming up the whimpering like the damsel running from the slow moving monster and then she breaks a heel wouldn t ya know if you liked mickey rourke in diner i suggest you don t spoil it for yourself 
good god this movie is bloodsport minus the entertaining parts better production value much worse script much worse everything almost so if you liked bloodsport which even at its cheesiest was a classic entertaining martial arts flick and you wanted to see another version of it that sucks but has more scenery well here you go ! enjoy 
awful but for teri hatcher teri hatcher fans can perhaps get some value for money but for her and her ample body on ample display this movie is just not worth the time terrible direction awful story miserable music !

nice thoughts wooden acting a film that many women who have read the book with effort and imagination make enjoyable apparently from other reviews pretty scenery such as walks along the ocean the costumes are often exceptional there is wonderful singing in one scene and over the closing credits for less imaginative women those who have not read the book and men characters including anne the captain display wooden acting poker faces others speak at a clipped pace the properness of the times allowed for personality as shown well in pride prejudice but not here shyness plainness or slowness may be portrayed likeably with some personality but not here both anne the captain maintain wide eyed desperate looks constantly many of us do get nervous within romance but we are compelled by conversation and activity to interrupt our nervousness with personality thus anne s the captain s constant wide eyed nervousness is un natural all of us at the age of anne and the captain would have refined our nervousness clearly showing shyness or thought or distance or hopefulness or approval or alarm poor directing you understand the quiet thoughts because of the story in spite of the confusing paralyzed looks rather than because of them you come to like anne and the captain toward the end in spite of the wooden acting because of the novelist s story a female reviewer who liked the film cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film a poor script for those who have not read the book good period romance films are so few and so desired that many women who have read the book work and imagine an enjoyable film better than it otherwise is i applaud their positive imaginations however they continued their imaginative thoughts into rating the directing of this film i would like to see this good story idea re made by a better director wellmade romance films are pride prejudice wives daughters north south and naughty marietta with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy fairly made is under the greenwood tree 
duped is the word believe it or not we watched this movie from beginning to end just to see if there s any redeeming feature what a waste of time ! we ve enjoyed all sorts of movies from the serious to the ridiculous but this movie is totally pointless pointless doesn t even begin to describe it what a cheap piece of if you have any appreciation for the art of movie making for a good story for good acting for provocative ideas for a good laugh or even for the sheer entertainment value of the ridiculous don t spend any money on it and please if you have seen it add your cents here so that fewer people get duped 
no title what a disappointment ! i remember siskel and ebert raving over this romantic comedy romantic maybe but comedy never very predictable plot from beginning to end and rosie perez was truly offensive a few times i couldn t understand what she was saying there is no way i could buy that she and cage s character were attracted to each other maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex violence or rough language although cage does get shot in one hold up scene it was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way i am beginning to like cage more and more as he ages spoiler i was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners either they shouldn t have changed it so much or they shouldn t have let us know about the real story it was based on end of spoiler but fonda and cage were very engaging together 
mindless entertainment with digital rites management drm issues we rented this movie unboxed but found it was not young teen friendly and decided to wait till the next evening when the kids were in bed to watch it unboxed rental warning when they say that you have hours to watch it they mean it we had less then mins of the movie remaining when the hours ran out and it was deleted right out from under us it really should let you finish a movie if it is actively playing 
do not buy this movie worst ever this is seriously the worst movie ever the last time i saw it was in the theater and i still can t get over how bad it was in fact it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy we didn t speak for six months after we saw it together ! i too wish i could give it no stars and obviously people aren t looking for this movie since the last review was in ! i can t believe you can even buy it on dvd 
good for a frisbee don t waste your time with this folks this movie is bad bad bad ! horrible acting stupid story prince directed it himself hey he can t be good at everything and outrageously ridiculous dialogue but a few of the songs aren t bad mountains girls and boys sometimes it snows in april and that s why i m even giving it one star this is a really dumb tale about prince and morris day s valet jerome benton going to france where the former is a gigolo who falls in love the one thing good i can say about this slop for the hogs is that it s better than the laxative onfilm graffiti bridge but if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet shooting then go for it 
two and a half stars out of five average from the word go musclehead bill goldberg the ex pro dlm ends his movie career here i know goldy got another movie later but here we see why he isn t the next rock supoorting cast is pretty badand belgian kickboxing champ van damjust isn t schwarzenegger that saysa lot and movie night filming doesn thelp props and fake us army set uplooks like something out of a returnof the living dead set ! not really any thing to right home about unless you reinto bill goldberg next stop intensivecare just like van dam and b g scareers after this movie can you beleivevan dam did another sequel 
columbia wimps out too bad republic didn t make this serial because over there they at least had commando cody and captain marvel up in the skies instead we get some fake animation everytime our boy in blue jumps i m sure that some think it s cute but i felt cheated i give them stars for trying though 
politically correct retelling ruins the message although it looks the same as the hg wells story and the movie this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man s nature into a mildly fun sci fi outing alexander s motivation for building the time machine is entirely different and what he learns years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind that is if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time travel paradoxes so the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the george pal version we don t even find out anything about what we are about to see but things get worse is in the distant future although the writing tries to dance around the fact they have de fanged the harsh reality of the eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete instead of unknowing sheep they are new agey world culture pluralists the dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense and there is no rod taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts the only reason why i give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci fi films in years and i found some of the special fx the moon and jeremy irons cheesy as they may have been fun 
dismayingly bad it s not just that if lucy fell is a bad film of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer directorstar eric schaeffer s nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday s roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he s cute speaks volumes 
texas chainsaw crapsacre this movie is far from being anything great some of the characters don t make any sense what so ever with the original cast leatherface s role has been mocked people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface the first tcm is a classic and the second tcm is great as well but leatherface tcm iii the next generation and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi enough is enough 
well i love you you potato head you d think with a cast including cary grant ginger rogers marilyn monroe and a chimpanzee all directed by the great howard hawks you d have a side splitter and a half but you d be wrong cause this snoozer barely even squeezed a chuckle out of me cary grant is a scientist working on a youth formula funny premise but it takes over minutes before the chimpanzee mixes up some real youth formula and grant accidentally takes it the results are humorous but the effects wear off too soon then ginger rogers drinks some and her take on the youth trip is just lame and even depressing finally at the end they both take it with unfunny results this movie was a great disappointment to me change the script replace grant with fred macmurray and replace rogers with either vera miles or katharine hepburn and you d have something 
just not really funny if you aren t really into jokes about the difference between black white sex drugs and how bad gays are this is not for you i had seen other stuff by pryor i always liked but this time i never once really laughed out loud it was dissapointing good thing he has so many other good stuf 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
stupid to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings aren t really too wise he s like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but doesn t really know that much joe pesci s character is pretty annoying that s probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser s character 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
not a horror movie except for the fact it is a horror to watch sstephen king can blame no one but himself for this missfire of a movie because he wrote this junk ! never finds it s feet horror comedydramafantasyadventureand even thriller it tries to be all and fails at each one skip it ! 
dissapointed ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander got my tickets in advance and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater the movie was a huge dissapointment while i wasn t expecting the movie to be just like the book i certainly wasn t expecting that while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears despite the fact that i ve read it over times 
huh i can t figure out which was worse the acting the dialogue the direction or the plot i rented the movie thinking ok a post ww spy thriller with nazi intrigue starring michael caine and directed by john f how could it be anything but spine tingling jeesh what a mistake believe or not caine is capable of giving a bad performance and this was it he just seems lost in this train wreck however he was olivier compared the rest of the cast veronica tennant shows why her career lasted months ! all the others were caricatures of stereotypes that orchestra conductor better be slinging hash somewhere now because acting was not his forte and the dialogue ! caine is supposed to be a foreign born american citizen he of course has as thick an english accent as in every other movie indicating he was brought up on the isle when veronica tennant tells him the umbrella is in the boot she has to explain that boot means trunk in england ! gawd are we all idiots the plot don t even get me started it s absolutely asinine our bumbling everyman is caught up in some meandering travelogue which is supposed to pass for international high stakes intrigue what a snorefest what were they thinking nah they weren t pass on this one folks 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
dreadful film that gives a new definition to the term family picture director of two scoobydoo films makes another comedy without the eye popping cgi of the funny talking dog and now what you get is yours mine and ours a remake of comedy that should have been left untouched the only good thing about the newer version is the kids and some of them would be seen in a much better film sooner or later so if you a fan of say dean collins please stop reading this review here take a look at the film and enjoy yourself but i m talking about the film itself and dennis quaid rene russo and what i am going to say is not very nice to their credits they truly look like two adults frank and helen widowed coast guard admiral and widowed designer who had been romantically linked to each other when high school students their story is sweet romantic and convincing sadly their story ends in five minutes the rest of the film is about the predictable culture clash comedy between two sets of values with lots of badly constructed pratfalls frank is an uptight military person while helen is a free thinking vegetarian frank has children while helen including the adopted kids frank demands his home should be shipshape while helen wants her kids always free so what would happen if they live in a same place one of the two terrible things about yours mine and ours is its awfully made slapsticks which are just embarrassing to see if you think it funny to see someone slipping over vomit on a yacht or dennis quaid soaked in green slime this is your film and you can also see mr quaid kissing a pig rene russo is not the same sexy woman you have seen in the thomas crown affair but her stand in who looks very tired but the most annoying thing is the characters of the kids or what they do these spoiled children are not only allowed to eat a bucketful of sweets but they plan to break up the relations between frank and helen just because they want to live as they want ! of course they relent after getting what they want and cue to the sappy ending this messy and unfunny comedy comes from four big names mgm paramount nickelodeon and columbia the images are crisp and shot in widescreen despite its beautiful package however none of the cast would like to remember the film and its contents that are simply dreadful 
pretty bad movie brokedown palace is bad how bad is it it s pretty bad man dont tell me i didn t warn you 
bunch of rich middle aged white people whining hey get real people the worl isnt the way you want it get over it i am in my late thirties going to night school taking care of elderly relatives and worrying about the bills wish i was rich so i could whine about unfair life i 
contrived implausible crime drama four brothers is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton s increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story reeking of artificiality features mark wahlberg tyrese gibson andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery the quartet launches into action seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced through their investigation in the neighborhood that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first year film student we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith rendering the boys thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best the acting is uniformly flat with the characters little more than wafer thin stereotypes and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second rate given the singleton pedigree in this area the boys running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother s killer is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque with nary a single moment that rings believable or true four brothers is by thebook filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more

survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
i will never watch this again as a lover of many types of music this movie sparked my interest so i rented it i found myself thinking throughout the movie i can t believe i m actually watching this what a waste not only was the plot slow to the point of boring but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that i as a grown woman actually fast forwarded through a couple of scenes the small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story also please carefully consider before allowing children to watch i will never under any circumstances watch this movie again i want the reader to know that i am in no way a movie critic i am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what i found to be a complete waste of an evening 
i don t know i ve watched this film about times i don t really know what it s about i should go out buy a copy and watch it about more times the story starts off with a expedition into a jungle in search of an old relic it ends with a finding of a greater one in between there s a blur i think i m going to buy it that s all 
good god ! what is this needs a zero star i gave it a chance and not suprisingly i was thoroughly sickened this is one of the latest in a crop of hip hop crime dramas featuring the same horrible rappers that fuel the soundtracks in the acting roles this movie left a foul taste in my mouth and quite a headache this is further proof that rap is ruining all forms of entertainment do yourself a favor and stay away from this incorrigible trash word yo 
forsake your dearly departed or you ll be sorry b grade movie really poor script bulk of movie is boring superficial stereotypical real purpose of movie is baptist condemnation of the supernatural story line the wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit the husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife on the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life overtonesthe leading man is depicted as unstable self centered reckless irresponsible and fantasy pronebefore and during the two year period when revealed to the those assembled the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned his giving up the ghost is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life the daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head on crash with a car leaving her frightened and distraught media messages the film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo spirit contact is dangerous selfish and emotionally unhealthy the personal grieving journey of another should be co opted by peers condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact there should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like what did she look like what kinds of things did she say messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted in short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones in life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us in passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond when william blake s brother passed he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all many near death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves the inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds the same is true for after death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film 
nothing wrong with movie but dvd fails this has always been a favorite film of mine the story is old fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine despite having the vhs i wanted more and ordered the dvd beware this dvd claims on its packaging to have closed captioning but it does not no subtitles in any language no line captioning nor does it have anything else interactive menus means scene selections this plain vanilla release doesn t even have a trailer this film and cast deserves better and i see no reason lion s gate reissued this dvd with nothing added since i bought it online i can t return it and neither lion s gate nor artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people i bought it from 
is this really what most normal people call erotic this is one of the most boring films i ever watched there is nothing erotic in it the whole story is perverted with a poor innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various lovers she is introduced i put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
the russians are coming your service was excellant the movie we ordered for a relative who could not find it why i have no idea as i did not care for the movie when it was new we will be ordering other items from you in the future and are very satisfied with your availabilty of movies etc 
worst bond movie apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film but when i re watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so i found it to be well nearly unwatchable whats so bad about it well how shall i begin sean connery is a dud there can be very little doubt that connery is the james bond but here he seems like he s just going through the motions to be fair he had no decent material to play the only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging he seems suitably worn out at various points and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before but these are grace notes by and large connery is stiff as a board here the action scenes are uninspiring i m not the biggest fan of the roger moore bond films but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes here the action is strictly second rate kim basinger and barbara carrera though great to look at give terrible performances there is literally no reason to see this in favor of thunderball of which it is a remake the original remains one of the all time great screen entertainments and this remake makes zero improvements in fact the plot merely becomes muddled there are a series of awful performances in supporting roles rowan atkinson s comic scenes though brief are painfully unfunny not to mention out of place the actor playing the new m is odious and whoever it is playing q isn t very good either the music is bad the title song is boring and the score by michel legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a bugs bunny cartoon i couldn t care less that the james bond theme is missing it s not what isn t there that s bad it s what is there all in all i d have to say that unless we re counting the version of casino royale this is the worst of the james bond movies it s worth seeing if you ve never seen it before but that s about it in my opinion 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
i just didn t get it this movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch i don t like that going back and forth and not knowing what they want from me and i really didn t get the ending i didn t buy the romance the only thing i enjoyed about this whole movie was kevin spacey that s it just skip through the rest of the crap 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
really dumb disney flick they chosen robin williams to be in a disney movie and this movie turned out to be very corny special effects are dull though if i were a kid i would probably like this movie but now that i m i think it s stupid i think i saw it in theater when i was and i don t remember much of it but i think it s not in stores anymore out to buy because people don t really care much about this movie anymore i don t care about it either i m glad this movie is out of stock and it should be it is very boring ! 
monotone mediocre instruction the level of detail in the instuction varies widely some asanas are almost painfully dissected others seemingly glossed over also instruction is delivered in a very serious sounding monotone i would recommend the yoga zone tapes over these 
bloody no good this movie is by far the worse of the urban legends movies this is another movie i purchased without renting it first had i rented it first i would not have bought this movie even though i did save money by buying it previously viewed a group of high school friends start talking about the legend of bloody mary chanting her name will make her rise from the dead ! oh boy the whole movie boils down to the fact that mary was murdered many years ago and her body put away where no one would ever find it when mary comes back to life she seeks revenge on fellow classmates and kills them off not a good horror movie no gore no suspense i would definetly recommend anyone rent this movie before buying it 
explain the phenomenon maybe it s just me but i really don t see the appeal of this movie it s an incredibly small production actors comprise nearly the entire film with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest either and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie if you are an alan rickman fan chances are you ve already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these don t let the promise of a nude scene convince you to buy this movie honestly alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very dialogue heavy film and the dialogue is not well written enough to carry it off 
planes maps and death oh my my friend and i watched this movie together and both agreed on one thing naveen andrews looks very good with long hair we were both so depressed by the end we wanted to weep ! and not in an oh my gosh that was good kind of way the movie is well made and the filming is beautiful but all the great scenery in the world can not overcome one of the most depressing sorylines ever this movie makes titanic seem cheerful ! my friend summed it up with saying obviously you shouldn t go and cheat with somebody s wife or you will end up with a burnt face or writing letters in a cave she followed this comment by saying i think i m gonna go home now and cry well i have to say on this one i agree with her for those of you that love this film more power to ya it s all yours 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
snore don t let the cover fool you this film isn t half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it s my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove or at least something interesting to watch and it s not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy division new order happy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost came off as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i wouldn t call this bad it had it s good parts just not many 
a slow paced drama despite the some edition problems and the presence of lagoons in the script the story retains its interest a disturbed woman in his early twenties who has suffered sexual abuse of his own father and maltreats of his husband finds casually a man in the middle of the road who eventually will help to dig in her life and face her demons 
one step above truly hideous i am a jane austen fan i love pride and prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel however mansfield park is jane austen s most complex and serious novel and on the whole it is my favorite fanny price is the most difficult of the jane austen heroines not the wittiest or most beautiful but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong she is mentored by her uncle the righteous and honorable and i don t use the terms loosely sir thomas bertram somehow the adaptation of this great novel has twisted sir thomas into a sadistic sexual pervert moreover fanny is constantly babbling to us in jane austen quips that are not part of this novel they simply missed the point of the book the acting is okay the settings are okay the directing is sad but the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste 
oh the humanity there are bad movies and then there are bad movies universal soldier the return is a cosmically bad movie a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to manos the hands of fate for comparison the first universal soldier film was a moderately entertaining shoot em up flick starring action stars jean claude van damme and rocky refugee dolph lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do people perished in violent ways stuff exploded and van damme and lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film even the presence of the charming ally walker as van damme s female sidekick greatly helped the film the movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition dvd some time back it unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel the second and one hopes final installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that i sat in open mouthed awe watching it i think i can safely say i am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll van damme returns as luc the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film on this outing he now works for dr dylan cotner xander berkeley a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer s eth luc with his female sidekick maggie kiana tom helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers the film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse pounding jaunt up a river a jaunt filled with explosions stunts gunfire and the briefest glimpse of tom s incredibly fit form as the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things kiana tom is incredibly hot but can t act her way out of a paper bag luc has a daughter named hillary karis paige bryant who you just know will get into trouble at some point and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are romeo bill goldberg and the one played by michael jai white frankly turning off the film immediately after glimpsing tom s amazing physique is probably a good thing everything that follows is dull predictable and so full of plot holes as to defy description universal soldier the return feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film sure enough cotner s computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers in the resulting conflagration s eth implants its consciousness in michael jai white luc and his loved ones flee from the compound and the military swoops in to contain the problem an extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called erin who is interested in exposing the government s latest shenanigans predictably van damme and schanz team up to track down erwell track down something to defeat the supercomputer i think they need some code to shut the system down but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse luc can hand out even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult s only club can t make this turkey fly it s dull folks and painfully so by the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between luc and s eth back at the shattered compound with an injured hillary s life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed luc geez what a surprise there i knew i just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck how bad can it be you ask read on plot holes in this film are innumerable as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager s face for example luc explains to erin that he was once a universal soldier just like romeo but cotner cured him by restoring him to life he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers what the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications he brought someone back from the dead ! how exactly did he accomplish this feat we don t find out from van damme who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications i could go on but let s discuss the performances instead or the lack thereof i should say i adore kiana tom she s a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth s rotation but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth another problem is the lumbering bill goldberg whose funny lines are anything but and the more i think about heidi schanz the less i think of her you have to wonder about a film where jean claude van damme is the best thespian in the cast you might think a movie this foolhardy shouldn t contain any bonus features on dvd you would be wrong trailers for this film the return double team desert heat knock off maximum risk and nowhere to run showcase the dubious career of jean claude van damme a making of feature a van damme career retrospective ha a michael jai white feature and talent bios round out the disc my advice to those viewers thinking of renting universal soldier the return run my friends run far far away and don t look back 
if all you want is yoga positions this video is for you i was disappointed in this video i was looking forward to doing a routine with my year old and trying to start her on self regulatory techniques the video merely did a well paced run through of various poses but gave no structure or routine to follow most disappointing 
boring i found the humor to be somewhat arid i had trouble staying awake not recommended while driving 
how low can hollywood go in my experience seeing the words national lampoon in any film title is a bad omen indicating tastelessness and a dearth of actual comedy up ahead national lampoon s gold diggers manages to take the series to an all time low which sadly is no mean feat will friedle and chris owen act as if they are auditioning for a future installment of dumb and dumber and the plot suffers from a definite ick factor and sadly those are actually the movie s strengths calvin friedle and leonard owen grew up together in an orphanage and are now trying to make their mark on the world as young adults they certainly don t want to have to work for a living so they take up a life of petty crime they are pitiful failures at this and wind up in jail then two old ladies they accosted on the street bail them out and invite them for a visit in their impressive home the guys by which i mean calvin as he s the only one really capable of actual human thought think their hosts are rich and so it is that they devise a plan to marry them wait for their imminent deaths and then live large on their inheritances doris louise lasser and betty mundt renee taylor may be heirs to the mundt prophylactics fortune but they are in fact cash poor thanks to their insane uncle who is in charge of the mundt estate they make their own plans to marry the two young men purchase sizable insurance policies on them and then kill them the double wedding takes place the marriages are consummated do i hear a yuck and about a month passes calvin finds that married life with buxom not deadyet doris is driving him insane so he and leonard begin setting accidental traps for their wives naturally the women are finalizing their own murder plans at the same time mr and mrs smith this ain t but that goes without saying i won t lie and say i didn t laugh or smile a time or two because i did but national lampoon s gold diggers aims low really low and cannot begin to escape the black hole of stupidity upon which it is built and i think i speak for the vast majority of human beings when i say that we just don t want to see senior citizen women prancing around onscreen like victoria s secret models there s crude and then there s national lampoon s crude and gold diggers is as crude as it gets this film should by all rights be a career killer for anyone involved with it although nikki ziering may emerge relatively unscathed given the fact that her screen time is severely limited 
not good simple as that another disappointing stephen king miniseries for some reason lately i ve been rewatching some of the older stephen king miniseries that i hadn t seen since they originally aired maybe i thought they d be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on the cream of the crop is the stand the dregs is the langoliers with the worst special effects ever ed wood would have been proud tommyknockers falls somewhere between basically it tells the story of how one lady marg helgenberger stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods and is compelled to unearth it turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its will on the people of the little maine town nearby these people undergo gradual or not so gradual personality changes which allows them to suddenly invent impossible machines read each others minds and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them thats all well and good sounds like it could be good clean gory fun certainly the book it s based on was i know that king himself is not terribly fond of the book mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too and a believable ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads i have always liked it myself to me king s nadir was the dark half back to the movie jimmy smits plays helgenberger s boyfriend a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism but trying to climb out of his hole he s immune to the power of the tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior eventually things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands with rather serious consequences for himself but the story is told in a plodding manner for every compelling scene for example early on smits is at a reception where he s been drinking too much and has a gloriously over thetop embarrassing moment there s two clunkers cliff de young and traci lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky panky in the sorting room helgenberger and smits are fine as are joanna cassidy as the local sheriff and e g marshall as a kindly curmudgeon but the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly and the subplot with deyoung and lords given far far too much time on screen de young is one of the worst actors ever to get more than one role to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile i guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star lords on their set they just couldn t help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do also we are forced to see how far robert carradine so good as the head nerd in revenge of the nerds all those years ago has fallen he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance the special effects and makeup are quite cheesy but many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed but the tommyknockers was doomed from the start with a pitiful script not helped by uninspired direction if you re a big fan of smits cassidy or helgenberger i guess you might want to take a gander if you re a fan of stephen king or horror scifistay away ! 
histoire d eau this movie is more a curiosity than a chef d oeuvre french for masterpiece of erotism it hasn t aged very well either it may have been a hit then because it was one of the first of its kind although i am not sure coming from my fellow french men i was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism i found the movie rather boring expect maybe for a few scenes the total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some 
hollow terrible one good line quoted here the characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting an effort to watch make up dyed hair costumes poorly done one man s eyebrows the suitor s are altered like a woman s no scenery or homes of interest except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor not a pleasant pace without humor without intrigue a lesbian undertone in one scene the only positive thing i can think of is this good line of jane austen quoted fanny sums up in one sentence why she will not marry him women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty will wish to sum up their certainty with ms austen s line his sole interest is in being loved not in loving this line is an exception to a lifeless script there now you do not need to endure the painful movie here are two lines re written by me for the woman dealing with a trifling man no man suffers pains of love on the stage for dealing with the infatuated man you have wounded yourself but not with love this movie should be re made by someone sharing the ideals of jane austen there is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film humorous with singing with interest a movie can take the best of the book in the spirit of the book which this movie did not carry and make a movie better than the book this movie is bad any which way wellmade period romance films are pride prejudice wives daughters north south fairly made is under the greenwood tree i rated persuasion at stars for the wooden acting however persuasion is stars compared to this mansfield park persuasion has attractive scenery costumes beautiful singing and an uplifting plot though of interest only to women preferably who have already read the book 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
agent dread this movie is so bad it barely deserves mention however i am a big dl fan and i am writing this in the hope that dolph will not abandon his fans he may be making movies like this just for the but i believe he is also doing irreparable damage to his career 
heartburn or men beware ! most women only want to breed this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own self worth is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl s movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant quothomemakerquot if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too 
movie won t start this movie will not start without giong to the scene starter grandchildren cannot start the movi 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
dv that doesnt work the dvd didn t work and returning it couldn t be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightes 
batman the movie review but this for my kids and it was the most boring movie i have ever watched the shows are more entertaining to watch then the movie 
one of the worst zombie flicks ever i m addicted to bad movies really bad movies ones that make you laugh at its pure inadequacy and the ones that are so cheesy that you can t help but be entertained then there are ones that are so bad you would have to be a masochist to sit throughout the entire duration of it ed wood s bride of the monster burial ground and manos hands of fate are three classic horrible movies that i have had the dishonor of seeing and will never forget the pain and boredom that i felt while suffering through the viewing of them hell of the living dead is definitely one terrible zombie flick that certainly and positively belongs among the worst movies ever made first of all it basically covers all of the zombie cliches ever created throughout the history of zombie movies jungle savages mad scientists a little gore a little blood extremely fake looking special effects a random soldier dancing in a green tutu top hat and cane and really really bad zombie make up makes this movie well worth watching also i can t understand why this movie is on the video nasties list i spit on your grave and the last house on the left are much more disturbing than this movie in any case you should check this movie out if you want something to make you fall asleep quickly or if you are a true masochist and desire great amounts of suffering and pain 
please enter a title for your review dumbest moral teen movie ever your average saved by the bell episode plays out more believably was there any discretion in choosing writers at all proof that any idiot with an english degree can work in hollywood i m not taking this movie any more seriously than it took itself it s just when it goes for making an actual point and is nothing but incoherent stupidity there s no fun to be had there s one unconventional idea i can credit this film with when john popularizes women s thong underwear with the boys at school after he gets tricked into wearing one and embarassed the ending i mean i saw it coming a mile away the girl s going to end up liking john i was interested to see how they d pull it off though and it seems like they just didn t at all apparently the girl was just as bad as john because she was manipulating him and that makes everyone even there wasn t much wrong with the basic plot outline beyond that watching a teen romantic comedy you accept that templates will be used the detail just needed to be filled in by a competent writer who could give the plot points more context and add more comedy with some minor script adjustments this movie could have gone from a to an 
only clips not the entire show only clips not the entire show like watching an overvie 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
flesh gordon i enjoyed this movie i orginially saw this move years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies i wouldn t really call it a porn movie it s more of a movie with adult humor i d give it an r rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today 
didn t really do it for me i just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great but i felt kind of let down after watching it it starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction but we really don t get to know any of them that well except maybe kurt russell so who really cares who dies there s no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship everything is fine then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen richard dreyfuss looks outside and the wave hits it s not all that intense then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship but it gets kind of repetetive and boring because they just go from one room to another it s like they get into one room someone says here this is the only way out someone else says that maybe there s another way but the other person says there isn t then the water s coming so they have to get out of that room quickly when they make their way into the next room it s the same thing over and over again when they finally get off of the ship they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off then a guy shoots a flare helicopters come and the movie s over so basically this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over this is one movie i know i won t be buying 
large disappointment showgirl is mistakenly taken to paris to perform for diplomatic relations accompanied by bolger wanna guess the ending everything from the songs to the plot are unconvincing and so very predictable not to be seen twice 
don t waste your time it only requires words to describe the movie absolute crap 
why did they bother i am a van damme fan and still hold out for the day when he makes a return to the big screen i bought this recently and now wish i hadn t unfortunatly with this entry it seems van damme has decided to self destruct what remains of his career i hope he made this during his drug addiction years if not then i think he has received one to many kicks to the head and should consult a doctor very predictable throughout which by no means is a bad thing if only the film was enjoyable and didn t treat its audience as if they were year olds logic seems to have been thrown out the window along with the two page script rent this before parting with your hard earned cash if only to see the fight scene in the lapdancing club ! van damme has shown some glimmer of hope with desert heat and replicant but i think the good old days of kickboxer timecop universal soldier and sudden death are long over 
sentimental and fake having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i can t fathom the entire plot is self serving shallow and unrealistic i guess it s supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i don t condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who don t get it and it doesn t mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the writer director gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you can t keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it s not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that wouldn t bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself 
typical rom com for genre bullockaffleck fans only if you ve seen one you ve seen them all uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl she brings him out of his shell well i bought this for like two dollars and maybe it was worth it i watch it like once a year no special features on dvd worth mentioning ben affleck is getting married he has to fly down to the south from ny for the wedding but things keep getting in his way forces of nature also he keeps running into and can t seem to get away from some weird chick bullock are these signs should he stop being so uptight and go with this free spirited chick or should he be an adult and get married and accept his vanilla lifestyle the acting in this movie is meh meaning sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie and affleck sucks as usual the other small parts are well done for the most part the script is formulaic and the cinematography at times is interesting it s just another rom com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell the movie opens with a stripper scene no nudity there is also a pot smoking scene in this movie there is also a scene where affleck strips at a gay bar just thought i d throw that in in case you re considering buying this for your teen daughter or something and that kind of thing bothers you you only need to buy this is you are a rom com fanatic or a big fan of either affleck or bullock otherwise this is completely forgettable 
i have not yet received this dvd i can t review an item you haven t sent me yet 
anger management fails i watched anger management on the plane since there is nothing else to watch and the flight is more than ten hours you usually watch whatever is on t v i thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad though there are some funny parts there is some offensive language overall it s a bad movie and is not worth watching 
a young vanity nude weird movie this is a very bizarre movie some ape creature becomes friends with vanity on an island where only she and her lover are her lover becomes jealous and then later the ape creature and he battle over vanity appears to be a dream vanity is cute and nude in the movie but she hardly looks like herself very odd movie if you are looking for vanity nude you are better off getting a copy of pickup a better movie or action jackson she shows skin in both here she does have a full frontal scene but it is not all that long anyway 
superficial stereotypical view of bosnian war this flick has all the sophistication of a music video it is basically an excuse for the director to show guys getting drunk and shooting off guns in a village in flames at night time while yugoslav rock music blares the relationship between the serb and muslim boyhood friendsturnedenemies should be the crux of the movie but it is never adequately explored it is no different than every other movie on the bosnian war with the exception of no man s land it does not show the geopolitical situation of the time or the machinations of elites but rather assumes the bloodshed was the result of ancient or grassroots ethnic hatreds obviously there were ordinary croatians serbians and some bosniacs involved in atrocities but this is only part of the story i got the feeling that this is the kind of movie made by a director who spent the early s in germany 
sucks i tried to watch this twice to see what the hype was i fell asleep both times not funny just slow boring and stupid way overated 
all lies an attack on america for what purpose these lies about the life of this man are the liberal film makers racists who don t believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest hurricane carter is not and was not that man factsin the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell they want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled times in a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved fact giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape the depitction is another lie another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder fact is that carter s boxing career was going down hill and he had only won of his last fights as carter s boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people while in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america shame norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn t care they just like the message looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet america bashing and race baiting is alive and well earning oscars and making for big box office a shame 
buy the other version the tai seng release i would like to give this version stars i love the movie but this is the dimension release which only offers an english language dub if that s ok by you then this is the cheaper version but if you are a purist like me you ll want the cantonese mandarin version with english subtitles

best movie with no conclusion i ve ever seen ok i m a scifi fan i read the scifi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me and it really was good right up to the end just one problem they forgot to write the end what happened did they run out of money did the writer write himself into a corner there was no climax conclusion or resolution you can argue till you are blue in the face about pan scan i prefer movies with an ending if you are looking for a great unfinished story this one is for you 
if you loved terms of endearment never watch this film i adore terms of endearment it s a movie that time and time again has never failed to touch my heart and make my cry i have known about the evening star for a long time but i just got around to seeing it for the first time while it was fortunate that shirley maclaine reprised her role as aurora the film didn t have the same chemistry that made terms of endearment such a memorable and much loved film the cast was just off with nobody except for marion ross delivering a much appreciated and genuine performance aurora returns in the evening star as a woman who has been weakened and instead of seeing her as she was and as she was loved we see her adapt to the lives of her loser grandchildren with little contest it s not the same aurora from the first film the aurora we see in evening star doesn t have the same essence of houston class the same sharp wit and overall she is a different woman than the aurora you grew used to in terms of endearment watching this movie was painful just because it was so predictable and well it was just lacking that soul that made the first film so special this movie was put together so poorly and it really shows emotional scenes are poorly done because whomever wrote the screenplay really tried to make everything over thetop so when there was a crisis it became an emotional spectacle with the entire cast instead of an intimate and thoughtful event between certain characters when tragedy would strike you d have a room full of characters you don t care about dilluting the scene and creating a disconnect in the moment i give the film star and that is only because we get a moment of time with jack nicholson marion ross did a good job and shirley maclaine came back to do her very best under the circumstances these people are the only minute saving factor in this entire upset of a film honestly though if you really love terms of endearment you may find yourself let down by the evening star i personally wish that i hadn t of watched it and allowed for the story to end with the first film overall i advise if you loved terms of endearment never watch this film 
fahrenheit dvd quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book hopefully they will remake the movie soon because the technical capabilities back in did not do the novel any justice 
special effects are just cheezy i can see that whoever made this put a lot of time and money into it trying to make this a big successful production however this fantasy film is best for ages and under special effects script lines acting and story are significantly lacking what the blockbuster s have too bad

stick with the first one after the scary and funny return of the living dead i couldn t wait to see this one know what turns out i could have waited to see it because this is the pits how could they have blown this movie so bad not funny not scary and not worth the price stay away 
overlong tv movie the movie doesn t have any good acting all mediocre and bergin who i liked in quotlost world quot isn t very good as the doctor i d get it though for the really fake but hillarious cat snake 
the worst action movie i ve ever seen i guess success turned around for sam raimi in with the two spider man films but first he created this v like character in this garage of a movie i liked v for vendetta but not this darkman if want to see a badly burned viligante in a mask see v for vendetta don t see darkman 
you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
my husband didn t like it he said that it is mostly filled with advertisements for boats and fishing equipment and rambling talking by his director 
amateur effort by a budding genius a good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late s and mid s allen got his name on the directorial map w this piece of fluff you gotta start somewhere tiger lily is more of a dry run for his later real comedies than an original film in its own right allen s early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick a must for allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so badtheyrefun movies 
night life song replaced the most memorable part of this film was the dance scene to night life which would repeat through the movie this version credits the song but it was replaced with some lame disco music i am writing mgm to complain and demand a refund even the trailer has the right music playing all through it demand the original 
disappointed this will only please the most ardent vampire fans why it s exceedinly poorly written i figured when i watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn t matter sadly it was neither don t get me wrong it was bad but in all of the wrong ways for example the writing plot dialog character development is basically not there well they are they re just about as interesting as chalk unfortunately the acting s not bad this results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie you can t laugh at the bad dialog because it isn t bad enough it s just flat and you can t laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it s acceptable it s got gore and blood but it isn t the least bit scary in general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of amityville horror to be released ryan reynolds may not play a vampire but that movie had more development in it s credits than this had in it s entirety 
not entertaining first let me say that i am a composer and die hard musician i just watched this movie to learn what i could about this supposed genius and i could barely keep from turning it off actually i did turn it off quite unattractive really turns out beethoven was an insane jerk and his lifestlye was not intersting to me at all he may have been a great musician but that is not really the focus of this movie in fact there is no focus in this movie except that he was a jerk if you want to watch a great movie about a great man i suggest the the endurance enrest shackleton will make you want to punch people like this beethoven character it will blow you away 
passed ages passed showcases i simply spent time watchnig this french response to a chaplin style but non silent motion picture maybe it was a top at the timing of the making 
you love it or you hate it it seems to be that way having watched this film three times since i keep revisiting it hoping that maybe something in me would change to make me like this film more but it hasn t when a movie wins nine academy awards i think maybe the intelligentia knows better they don t this film is positively plodding the acting or the screenplay is not anything exceptional in any way no small wonder that fiennes and scott thomas were beat out ! i am a person who is usually moved by what i see but the more i view this picture the more i realize why the seinfeld show dedicated a whole episode to their hate of this movie when i revisit the nominees for i see what a weak field this film was up against but certainly fargo shinesecrets and lies and even jerry maguire were more compelling than this hour bore to each his her own you will either love it or hate it i preferred the latter vehemently 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download 
i did not find it funny the only way you will find this movie funny is if misfortune and incompetence in life tickle you the setting is baltimore in the late s or early s and richard dreyfuss and danny devito play the two main characters they are aluminum siding salesmen commonly referred to as tin men and are largely con men almost anything goes when pursuing a sale lies and deception are acceptable sales techniques in order to maintain the appropriate image it is almost mandatory that a tin man drives a cadillac dreyfuss is at the local dealership and purchases a cadillac in the process of backing out of the dealership driveway he is hit by devito both men blame the other for the accident and this starts a personal feud it starts a cycle of car smashing and other vandalism until dreyfuss decides to go for the ultimate score he decides to seduce devito s wife this proves to be easy as devito is incompetent as a husband immediately after dreyfuss scores with devito s wife he calls devito to inform him of that fact this immediately ends the marriage and devito throws a pathetic fit i fail to see how anyone could consider this to be funny this starts a cycle of further disasters for devito a city commission is investigating the practices of the tin men and devito is stripped of his license to sell siding the irs is investigating him for failing to pay his taxes and they are demanding that he pay them immediately once again his responses are to get angry and blame everyone else for his problems if there is a bright side to the movie it is some of the conversations between the tin men especially interesting is the talk about the old bonanza television show one man wonders why there are four men on the ponderosa and they appear to have no interest in women while it is clear he is hinting at homosexuality the producers were adept at keeping the conversation within the bounds of the time i did not find the movie funny in fact i was glad when it was over devito is so pathetic that you feel sorry for him but feeling sorry is nowhere near laughing 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
some magical moments in mgm mishmash for those who grew up watching gene kelly s singin in the rain and on the town the mgm mishmash of anchors aweigh will prove a disappointment nevertheless there are some magical moments the film s highlight is gene s breakthrough dance with jerry the mouse a stunning fusion of animation and live action along the way frank sinatra sings a few memorable numbers amid the technicolor splendor however you must keep your finger on the fast forward button to encounter these gems running minutes it s obvious that the editor fell asleep at the moviola though directed by the usually reliable george sidney one wishes kelly had more creative control over this unwieldy project anchors aweigh should be viewed as a warm up to the far superior on the town 
flat acting no energy poor casting poor acting unconvincing characters the leading lady had no energy there was no excitement sexual or otherwise boring one of king s worst in contrast i found king s swimming naked red shoe diaries to be enjoyable the acting wasn t great but the stories were mildly entertaining and the nude scenes very pleasant 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download 
disappointing flick overall the initiation is very slow and dreadful movie the first minutes are wasted with flashbacks and talking but the end in the shopping mall is decently done the ending plot twist was a nice surpise but other than that this movie is strictly rental material 
almost good i can respect director adam marcus for trying to pull away from the series and do something different but we already had the bs ftth movie part v jason wasn t the killer technically jason is the killer in this movie but it s not really you ll see what i mean when you see the movie and it is worth a see but by the th or th movie they were movies for the fans they stopped making them to be innovative by the th movie and were just making them to make money and entertain the audience adam marcus wanted to be innovative with jason goes to hell and it doesn t work not for fans or an average audience there s nothing interesting about seeing random people who act like jason walking around and killing people not to mention without the trademark machete they could ve at least given these people a little personality with the machete but whoever called that one thought they were doing the series a favor the introduction of jason having a sibling niece and now a great niece i think by the th movie in the series is a little too late sorry we would ve had to know about these people by at least the rd or th movie to make us care about their struggle another thing jason as a snake demon creature crawling around the floor hmm i wasn t under the impression that jason was really evil in the first place let me explain jason has been made out to be mentally physically disabled if ginny in part was able to convince him that she was his mother by wearing her sweater than jason isn t evil at all he just loves his mom and kills all the victims because he believes that they re responsible so jason as a wierd little hell creature doesn t necessarily work when bringing it into the context of the other movies the design of jason s actual appearances in the movie doesn t make sense either what happened between part and to get his mask somehow buried and melded into his face why does he look fat where did his hair come from at least part had some respect for the look and personality of jason while it might not have been the best in the series it was at least satisfying to see him the way we know him and not make drastic changes which don t even benefit his appearance adam marcus i can respect you for trying to make your own movie and yeah it s definately yours don t try and make your own movie the th movie in a series of movies that are about the fans and don t bs the fans with your idea of an improvement of the series id say fans should see this movie just to see it it s worth the view and the surprise cameo at the end wink 
my disc was defective too and the movie wasn t worth it i actually bought this dvd over a year ago but just decided to watch it i m a huge fan of sidney lumet and i like richard gere gene hackman and the other stars in the film about mins into the movie the picture started distorting and after that it would skip large chunks of the movie there was nothing visibly wrong with the dvd itself but i saw enough even before i reached the defective part it was like watching a foreign film without subtitles i had almost no clue what was going on and didn t really care after a while i can usually watch almost anything most movies have some redeeming quality for example maybe an exotic interesting locale this is largely set in new mexico no offense to new mexicans but skip this i threw it away 
i couldn t even finish it i love alice and i love low budget works full of heart but this production was so relentlessly mediocre that i just couldn t bear to finish it the songs are lifeless and as poorly paced as the rest of the performance and the script lacks any spirit overall this production adds nothing new to the story yet fails to convey the charm of the book or for that matter nearly any other production i ve seen as another reviewer mentioned the dvd itself is unimpressive the chapters are as near as i could tell either random or simply timed without regard to content if this production is a familiar favorite from your childhood it may be worth something unless the dvd transfer is as disappointing as it seemed to me if you re looking for something new look elsewhere 
miserable acting horrible script inane directing what a mind numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror comedy of all time the re animator continuing in his deluded quest to claim the re animator series for his own and to convince us that he can direct producer brian yuzna has managed the opposite beyond re animator merely confirms what was evident about the yuzna directed bride of re animator that yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story as with dagon yuzna seems to have secured financing from spanish sources for this film unfortunately the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly spanish cast this is a story set in massachusetts for crying out loud why would the warden of the prison the reporter coming to cover the story the guards and a good per cent of the inmates all have spanish accents it wouldn t be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act but they can t simon andreu as warden brando and elsa pataky as love interest laura olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast but their acting is so bad and their adr afflicted lines so glaringly off that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes witness the gratuitous nurse nipple scene in this film or fabiana udenio and kathleen kinmont in bride of re animator and pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests i can remember but even pataky and andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery seething mass of bad acting that is leading man jason barry based on yuzna s shoddy history with actors one might be tempted to blame it on the director but the fact is that in this film jason barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment basic elementary acting his every internal and external beat rings false his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre most high school students do better than this jeffrey combs as herbert west seasoned pro that he is gamely plays along but the script puts west s character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit inducing pataky andreu axis that combs is unable to save this film on a strictly technical level the cinematography looks good the score is all right though often too serious minded for its own good and the film doesn t look low budget but when the story is such a mess and the actors so inept no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film yuzna really should stick with producing because on the stuart gordon directed dagon at least there were some good moments but beyond re animator is beyond salvaging possibly the worst film sequel i ve ever seen and way up there in the list of worst films i ve ever subjected myself to 
watch das boot instead i just finished watching das boot to even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous where das boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war u is just more hollywood tripe if you just want splosions and escapism i guess u does the trick if you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come go with das boot 
is cringeworthy a word i m surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond there really wasn t much here i liked the soundtrack was the usual pap you d expect from a family friendly movie though the sets were nice it seems this movie was just miscast mel just doesn t do comedy all that well at least for a lead role jame garner the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character although the cast is a powerhouse on paper sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball an example there was a sequence when bret asks his friends who are standing behind him to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting which as it turns out they are unable to do instead jodie and james blow madly just like the movie this movie reminds me a hell of a lot like the three amigo s on paper you would think it couldn t miss but on film it s painful to watch 
did we see the same movie okay the script is not the most imaginative i ve ever seen but i like the actors especially ben s best man so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i didn t even mind the obvious holes in the plot such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones or at least why don t they use them oh no much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for to buy a car to drive to nc i didn t even mind the fact that the whole were married and my husband s a doctor charade was so predictable oh gee he s pretending to be a doctor and he s on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d ya think someone might have a heart attack and dr holmes might have to step up and uh they re pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there s the best man and maid of honor ! d ya think they re gonna get busted what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending it was obviously supposed to be a surprise and it was but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience i felt cheated i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah s little boy and all that i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they re not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen right up to the last moment we think he s breaking it off with bridget instead what the heck let s just go ahead and get married after all huh he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back this man obviously doesn t have a clue what he wants in life and i m expected to believe they lived happily ever after not only that but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us dont do it and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway it s just marriage it s romantic ! you could get lucky and live happily ever after its been my experience when things aren t feeling just right as you approach that wedding turn and run the last thing you should do is close your eyes grab your balls and take the leap 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
they tried this movie well it was boosted up like it was something really great it had its moments but man it had its weak times too the little monster in this movie was just screaming like a girl the whole movie and that was really annoying you can check it out i didn t like it too much though oh well thats my opinion maybe you can find some good in it 
go figure the title of this movie perfectly describes the acting even the little giants had better actors than this and those kids were only like or years old ok so they were probably thats not the point second string tries to use those inspiring lines that all football movies have you know the ones meant to give you goose bumps but they don t succeed at all in fact they fail with flying colors when i first saw this movie i decided that i d rather be the sunblock boy at a senior citizen s nude beach than watch it again needless to say i haven t seen it since 
no memorable quote available half hearted adaptation of ernest haycox novel is weak scott is good as owen knox is equally good as the baddie but the film is missing movement if there were ever a razzie award at the time it would have to go to the title song 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
do not watch this film this film is laughably bad the entire plot is completely unrealistic and it is difficult to have any sympathy for the cruel murderer who is central to the plot who is not only a murderer but also totally retarded missing numerous opportunities to escape and make life easier for himself and the saps who for some random reason have taken it upon themselves to look after him this film is an absolute waste of time but feel free to watch it if you feel like wasting minutes of your life 
am i hard of hearing the sound quality on the dvd was atrocious too bad given the great burt bacharach score 
being french does not mean you don t have to say your sorry as the director and actors of this mess should on their skinny french knees complete waste of film and your time not erotic sexy was that actress really a woman was her boyfriend really a man or visa versa damned if i could tell and that old man who tired her up ya think he had enough rope the movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through french people are not pretty and this woman was not only not pretty but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience 
this movie ruined my life bad moon begins in some south american country where michael pare and his girlfriend are attacked by a werewolf the movie stumbles quickly into the perspective of thor a wonderfully loyal german shepherd owned by mariel hemingway whom i tend to think is kind of scary looking with her weird cheekbones and her sunken eyes and her son the little boy who played dennis the menace michael pare who is mariel s brother soon comes into the picture struggling to come to grips with the attack and his living a life as a werewolf at first you feel pity for his character i mean the guy witnessed his lover attacked and eaten by a monster and is now himself living the life of the beast but you soon feel nothing but disgust and hatred towards the man when he decides to have a mental battle with thor the movie was scary and tense in parts and the gore factor was high but i had such a hard time with some scenes in the film i was very disturbed by the scene where michael pare s character entices thor to bite him therefore getting thor hauled off by animal control people in a truly heartwrenching scene that still to this day makes me sick the movie is good in some aspects the directing is good and you truly fear for the people in the situations they are in the creature effects are excellent and i much rather prefer costume physical makeup werewolves over the newer van helsing type werewolf that cgi designs have come up with there is nothing worse than a computer animated werewolf just watch the movie cursed to see what i mean this movie to me is all about watching a poor territorial dog who wants to protect his owners get pushed around the cgi in this movie was awful just because it was and cgi was pretty much new to movies at that time so the transformation scene in the end was a crapfest the hero of the movie thor is what i am giving this movie stars for because the dog really does pull through for the viewer and make them care you kind of watch the movie only for the dog you want the dog to live and get through it and almost could care less about the family by the end of the film overall the movie was scary and the werewolf was pretty good compared to some of the crap that has been out there in the past but the dog getting knocked around and tortured throughout the movie was enough to ruin my life forever at least the ending was somewhat happy i was somewhat confused by the dream she had but it seems to end with everything alright oh well the movie was decent but could have been longer and could have had less traumatic incidents involving the dog 
a must view for sophia loren fans even though i am not a sophia loren fan i thoroughly enjoyed her perfomance in these different short stories about totally different women anyone born before should enjoy them as well 
regional issues unless i missed it it was unclear that the video download only worked in certain regions so i ended up wasting my money 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
the creator of m ash wrote this i was surprised to see larry gelbart wrote the screenplay of this unfunny movie i can recall very few laughs in this film the premise of the film is to highlight the greed of the s but the lesson is quite dated in the era of enron and worldcom the greed here is apparent and at least honest and upfront in contrast to the dishonesty and deception of some of the greed of the late s as for the message i certainly don t think the shareholders of rjr reynolds minded being courted so well if i were a shareholder of a slumping company i d be mighty grateful to live in a society where people have the freedom to pay whatever crazy price they want for my stock ! james garner is wonderful in this show and the movie does a nice job of laying out the business concepts in terms your grandmother can understand i do have to confess however to dozing a bit in the middle of this movie so perhaps i missed the funny parts 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
where was the war this is a film about two soldiers captured during the chechen war normally the chechen rebels don t take prisoners but one of the men is hoping to trade the soldiers for his son who is being held by the russians as time passes the younger of the two soldiers ivan begins to feel for the rebels and to wish he could live among them the soldiers are told to write to their families and have them ask the commander to trade them for the rebel s son ivan s mother tries but ultimately fails in her attempt eventually the rebels get tired to waiting and kill the older soldier ivan gets free and runs for the hills ending the movie with his escape 
even steve thinks this film sucks after doing this film steve martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it but roxanne la story and bowfinger are some of steve s best works 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
superman returns but to do what exactly i can understand why everyone would want this to succeed but there are three reasons why it didn t first of all you would think warner brothers would learn from the reinvention of the batman franchise they nearly killed i always thought the target audience should be adults and then would eventually make it down to kids this kind of campy storytelling will not be tolerated by the public at large anymore secondly i felt there was some sentimental value attached to this film due to the passing of christopher and dana reeve to not allow a more objective critique of the film i m not coming down on brandon routh at all i think he did a wonderful job taking the superman mantle aside from a few poor casting choices bossworth and posey the cast carries out very good performances not surprising was kevin spacey s marvelous performance as lex luthor while clearly differing from hackman s performance spacey offers a more jubulent take which adds more depth to the character and third what made this film lose its cohesiveness was the direction of the story bryan singer did a great job of re introducing the characters but after that failed to take the movie in a clear direction so in truth you only need to see the first half of the film after the second half you might end up scratching your head a shout to the people at warner brothers you boys clearly don t have a clue wether you have a good thing or a bad thing so i ll make this real simple either hire a competent writer to tell a good story or sell the rights to make these movies superman is a good character with a wealth of material in the mythos to use and it shouldn t be butchered by the likes of you take notice folks donner s films are going to out gross this one too 
wasted that should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high profile cast normally respectable director are put to another possible title is its all about the groceries cause i m hard pressed to think of a reason other than money why anybody involved would ve signed on to this project it starts promisingly with atmospheric shots of the golden gate bridge rising through fog over san francisco the camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman s throat once again ashley judd is a victim in jeopardy so it seems then the victim proceeds to open a can of whoop a all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp one starts to think that this might be getting good especially after ashley s apparently super competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues a pretty hefty drinking problem a propensity for picking up strangers in bars having rough sex with them and some grisly skeletons in her closet i was interested to see what judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim unfortunately not enough ms judd is a luminously beautiful actress even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough i suppose it is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame she has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like jessica though playing it distressingly one note is she ecstatic depressed in a drug induced stupor the way judd plays it it could be any or all of the above i like ashley judd but she is in danger of turning into the female version of richard gere a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk food roles that do not challenge her talent kiss the girls was the high water mark each subsequent film has been weaker than the last this movie is worth the price of a rental but i d take a pass on purchasing it for a better treatment of female copwithdarksecretsandissues a stronger movie all around i recommend murder by numbers with sandra bullock 
poorly done mocumentary hour party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung if best in show was not enough that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste the british scene in the s was influential and at the height of the nd brit wave and michael winterbottom could have exposed the goings on in a much better way my main issue with this film was it s attempts at being funny in a hip britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious the dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway and the film never really follows it s premise as much as it should the rise of factory i did really enjoy the joy division segments though even if exploiting ian curtis s death was slightly in poor taste unless you re a fan of the brit explosion of the post punk era and an extreme fan at that i could not recommend this film it s not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into 
is this really what most normal people call erotic this is one of the most boring films i ever watched there is nothing erotic in it the whole story is perverted with a poor innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various lovers she is introduced i put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings 
the ultimate ss wipe give me a break this is the hokiest plot i have ever seen read or dreamed of the ultimate attraction is in reality the ultimate ca ca example the story starts out where a guy locked in an airplane restroom flushes a device which looks like a combination of a tv remote control and a pocket cassette recorder down the toilet where it is discharged outside the airplane and falls through the roof of a health club and lands on a stack of towels next to and in a closet where a gorgeous babe gabriella hall and some numb nut guy are fornicating does anybody hear the device crashing through the roof no ! do the amorous couple notice it dropping onto the shelf next to them or notice there is now a hole in the roof no lo and behold the lovers eventually notice the object from the sky and start fooling around with it you know turning dials and aiming it and guess what it makes a gal on one of the exercise machines get stimulated and have an orgasm i should mention that the health club is in default with the bank and unless thirty thousand buckeroos are raised within the next three weeks it will be foreclosed upon and so these employees decide they can use this little machine to increase membership raise the thirty thousand for their boss and save the club and of course their sexual rendezvous location their plan seems to be working a little stimulation here and there and everybody is really digging it but then something goes wrong and pretty soon the clientele is going at it like rabbits in heat clothes are slung around everywhere and everybody is engaged and in some state of undress if this movie is so bad why did i give it two stars well i never said the movie was terrible just the story nobody really expects the stories for soft porn movies to very good and this story was one of the worst but on the flip side for a movie showing attractive people in various states of undress depicting gratuitous sex which is what most soft core movies are like this movie wasn t bad i guess it depends on what you re looking for and if you re looking a profound story in a sensual soft core movie you re in the wrong genre ultimate attraction was a soft porn movie with an abominable plot that was otherwise typical of the genre i didn t pay much attention to the guys except for the geek that was with gabriella hall but the girls were great looking with nice bodies especially gabriella hall jacqueline lovett and jennifer burton if you are looking for a good movie in the so called light erotic comedic vein there are better movies around but if you just want to see some good looking guys and gals in the altogether it delivers final rating stars 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
one of elvis worst movies i ve seen all of elvis movies most several times this is one of the worst only stay away joe and harem scarem are worse i usually watch every elvis movie every time it comes on tv but not these three 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
did i watch the same movie ok i read the other reviews for this movie and i am a little confused was it the same movie the martial arts were ok in this but nothing i havent seen done better before the story line was ummm well nevermind oh and did i mention the film doesnt end i mean i didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though i really wantedto like this movie but the only good thing i can say is that some of the sub titles are hilarious 
another uninspired sequel chon wang jackie chan and roy o bannon luke wilson reunite to recover the imperial seal of china and avenge the death of chon s father the keeper of the seal they are joined by chon s sister the beautiful and equally dangerous lin fann wong the chemistry of wilson and chan is as delightful as ever but that and the beautiful and talented wong is about the only reason to watch this tired comedy even the action scenes are uninspired a disappointment 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
whiny slackers poke reality with stick reality bites back reality bites seemed fresh when it was first released giving voice to a generation with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of x that was overeducated underemployed plagued by the flashy trashy commercialism of mtv and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college it was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass cruel arena of materialism can be tough providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth the very stuff of real movies instead we have a swan dive into a pizza hut commercial held together by a plot so shop worn it would have been considered exhausted in winona ryder is winning as lelaina but one can only imagine the sats of football players at a college where she is valedictorian her documentary is appallingly narcissistic reflecting the characteristic gen x notion that if it s about me it s art and it s important ethan hawke does an excellent job as troy the very archetype of self satisfied supercilious entitlement we are expected to root for him but it s hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus stiller who directed a talented fellow almost impossible to look at plays michael the antitroy smooth successful and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of gen x culture if culture is the right word he s an executive at an mtv ish corporation that he improves lelaina s preposterous documentary rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity is the film s dirty little secret viewers surprised by who wins lelaina s hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and liberace was gay indeed when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie janeane garofalo is outstanding as always and john mahoney shines as the tv morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact a bastard his performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film or on tv than the rest of this film put together in fact reality is great this picture would have benefited from some

this is supposed to be a comedy but where s the proof this isn t funny it isn t well directed or scripted perhaps it could have been great if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director but it didn t so it turned out mediocre at best unfortunately i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i d read this was going to be a brilliant hilarious cult classic but now that we ve watched it he and i both know better we know it s dreadful and i can only imagine all the nice things i m going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we d seen one of the actors in the movie before i m pleased to say i won the argument that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me in my opinion this is not a hilarious cult classic as others so often describe it i don t know how drunk i d have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie or to find it even a little bit funny but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i d need a stomach pump afterwards if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci fi classic pick up a copy of flash gordon that has great actors great sets wonderfully campy scripts brilliant humour and a soundtrack by queen furthermore it has stood the test of time and is still great today unlike the ice pirates which has dated really badly better yet get hold of some red dwarf dvds seriously red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it s so good it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies 
a rotten musical this film represents the low point in the splashy grable musicals released by twentieth century fox during the war the story script is really appalling and bruce humberstone a frequently poor director adds nothing grable plays a secretary doubling as a night club performer as far as plot that is about it in typical fox fashion the colour and sound are excellent grable looks attractive but the makeup is quite heavy particularly the bleached blonde hair she was pregnant during shooting and the costumes have been designed to hide this one would hope that martha raye and joe e brown would help but the material is so bad that they are just noisy and distracting most of the songs are lousy too duds like dont carry tales two redeeming feature the song once too often as hermes pan and grable perform a tame apache dance and the title tune nicely sung by grable in close up the film represents hollywood cynicism at its worst fox built a film around grable s status as the pin up of world war but neglected to give her a script or a decent leading man not to worry the public will come anyway and of course so they did in the long run though junk like this chips away at the reputation of this appealing star who barely holds the film together by sheer star quality her pretty face and her sense of humour if you are not an ardent grable fan you ll hate the film pin up girl really supports the view that betty grable made poor films which don t warrant revival in fact many of them are first rate entertainments but certainly not this one ! it should however be noted that the print of the film in this dvd is excellent and among the extras is an entertaining deleted number which can be seen already in the hidden hollywood series 
warning not in a long time have i had such a dislike for a movie as i do with freeway i am a fan of dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out it has reese witherspoon after all how bad could it be well really bad first of all on a good note reese witherspoon is good enough in the movie although her character isn t all that likeable nor do you empathize with her all that much but reese does a good job with what shes given my main beef with the movie is that i would not call it a dark comedy it s more like a comedy that also wants to be dark graphic and serious or a dark graphic serious movie that wants to be funny the result is that it s a movie that doesnt know what it is or what it s trying to do both the funny parts and the serious parts are horribly mixed together in a way that it feels like two different movies fighting for the screen but hey if you find being shot in the neck or stiff lifeless grandmas with their throats slit and a horrified expression on their face to be funny you just might like this movie 
a dissenting view as the reviews below indicate arthur has a lot of fans when it was released in vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful screwball comedy although over time times readers perhaps more discerning than vincent have only rated it out of stars and bravo listed it on its list of best comedies see below i first saw dudley moore in foul play thought he was very funny based upon that i bought and arthur as it turned out a downward trajectory what i dislike about arthur is moore playing a loud obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes and minelli playing a salt oftheearth working girl who loves arthur for himself not for his million fortune even john gielgud who was great in the loved one a much better comedy can t resurrect this turkey okay folks start casting your negative votes in the meantime here s the bravo best comedies list anchorman the birdcage school of rock happy gilmore four weddings and a funeral harold kumar go to white castle waiting for guffman the aristocrats father of the bride revenge of the nerds clueless slapshot team america the kentucky fried movie zoolander dirty rotten scoundrels silver streak sister act tootsie half baked lost in america three amigos bananas flirting with disaster ghostbusters dumb and dumber trading places city slickers moonstruck roxanne the nutty professor eddie murphy the blues brothers broadcast news kingpin dazed and confused office space this is spinal tap manhattan the pink panther election when harry met sally police academy series private benjamin swingers young frankenstein bull durham ferris bueller s day off dr strangelove meet the parents national lampoon s vacation the princess bride american pie american graffiti to the incredibles raising arizona sixteen candles what about bob harold and maude austin powers monty python and the holy grail mrs doubtfire best in show dodgeball good morning vietnam beetlejuice rushmore clerks groundhog day the big lebowski the year old virgin legally blonde annie hall a fish called wanda wayne s world meet the fockers bill ted s excellent adventure big beverly hills cop shampoo the jerk wedding crashers stripes m ash old school fast times at ridgemont high napoleon dynamite naked gun series the producers pee wees big adventure arthur ace ventura pet detective blazing saddles the wedding singer airplane south park bigger longer uncut there s something about mary shrek caddyshack animal housemy suggested additions the loved one leap of faith used cars eulogy and drop dead gorgeous

i ve seen better i was somewhat entertained watching this movie john travolta made it more interesting that it would have without him however it did not really impress me very much it s the kind of movie to see only once it s definetely not a collector s item

beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
larry garfield is compared to when danny devito s plays larry garfield he is like taxi s louie de palma of wall street 
hoosiers slasher style this movie is part canadian soap opera and part effective slasher movie the plot is a ripoff of the prowler or vice versa either way the prowler is a much better movie go see that instead it deals with a vengeful wraith promising to spree if a valentine s party is ever held after a tragic holiday party toblame accident in a coal mine left one survivor to resort to cannibalism and unemployment of coarse you know them crazy kids go and party anyways basically anything to do with the killer miner or the mine itself is great but everything else is just plain tacky john stanley of the creature features guide gave it stars ive decided that anything he says is good is automatically bad i can t believe that a band actually decided to ripoff this particular piece of pop culture to sell records its not because they were on drugs but because they were in the imagination less state of not doing drugs 
amazon download does not work after downloading the file i have not been able to view the movie it keeps ont trying to get a license much simpler using movielink or vongo 
a well acted snooze fest with juvenile politics this is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills it would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner the shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery the politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray i can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script bonghitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing bhlswhncatrw interrupts evil corporation why are you being redundant the only plus for my wife and i was the acting which was great fiennes was especially good underplaying his character in the early parts of the film resulting in a character with depth and nuance i only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it 
the blue fairy gimmie a break this movie was cheeseball beginning to end i thought the concept was corny even before i watched it but decided to give it a try anyway big mistake a robot who can love lame ! and with all this high tech stuff the docs can t bring the couple s real son out of a coma or whatever was wrong with him so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can love but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone brialliant plan especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin the family decides they don t want the robot and the mom loves him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of it was then i knew i was smelling a stinker but nooooo someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth i have since nicknamed it artificial idiocy the worst part was the end ugh i don t even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what i mean the whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism for those of you who have not seen it i suggest renting it before you buy it maybe this movie is great for some people it just wasn t my thing 
u s release doesn t compare to the original the u s release is a far cry from the original and more of an insult than anything else i can tell everyone though for a fact that the original theatrical release spoken in original mardrin cantonesesubtitled in english is the s its not only entertaining and hilarious the fight scenes are absoloutely incredible soif you get the opportunity buy the vhs tape i did about years ago and although it s not dvd quality its still a fantastic film i suggest checking out ebay for it on dvd you may be surprised and find the original out there this is a must have film for any jackie chan martial arts fan its a perfect blend of action and comedy i suggest staying away from the editied dubed u s release its been butchered find the original it will be worth every penny even if it costs a bit more 
the book is so much better i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it and absolutely loved it ! it is so smart funny and heartbreaking without ever being sappy so naturally i was curious about the movie too i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too not much could go wrong and while the story line followed the book more or less the movie turned out terrible i could not have been more disappointed first of all jack nicholson is completely miscast because he essentially plays himself as usual not the interesting guy that mark is supposed to be he is the opposite of charming funny tender lovable i e somebody that the character of the wife rachel would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely you suspect all along that he is a cad therefore rachel s utter shock at his betrayal doesn t make sense besides he is too old for the role ! meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy but much better in her role as rachel still she can t carry the movie alone and her love scenes with nicholson are flat there is no spark there i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel and whether she really did write all the scenes the wedding scene where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like hours in a room alone agonizing while the wedding guests wait is out of place not to mention boring not to mention heavy handed a total dud 
you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
all the bad things you heard and then some more there is nothing good i can say about this movie there is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining about it if the main characters didn t go by the names of mario luigi you d be lost nothing here resembles the video game it s based on which isn t a bad thing neccessarily except that nothing here resembles any kind of story the acting is bad perhaps on purpose but who cares it s not amusing in the slightest the movie is boring in minutes you ll want to gouge your eyes out super mario bros the movie has been proven to damage brain cells upon each viewing in a koopa shell don t waste your time on this movie don t even look at the cover don t even read this review just try and pretend this movie doesn t exist 
duvall superb not so for convicts as usual robert duvall s acting was phenomenal why i purchased the movie but the movie itself was pointless and boring my husband and i fell asleep when we woke up robert duvall s character was dead ! enough said 
another king masterpiece butchered i find it disheartening that so many of king s masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations and perhaps it s mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film im not sure delores claiborne stand by me misery carrie shawshank redemption the shining and the green mile all did well then we are treated to stinkers like it maximum over drive dreamcatchers thinner the running man firestarter and of course this one did i forget to mention stephen king s own remake of the shining he should have settled for the original this film has all the feel of a made fortv movie or direct tovideo film and in fact that s what it should have been the film was terribly fast paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book they jumped into the darker elements way too quickly there is barely a set up for the horror to come that they left out norma crandall was very disappointing as she added to judd s character so much he s barely even interesting in the film fred gwynn turned him into a goofy drawling old man over acted not subtle at all as his character was in the book ellie the daughter was a terrible actress i am sure they could have found a better actress than her she was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural even the cinematography was badly done everything is way too bright for the plot line too many primary colors it felt like they were on the set of a soap opera at least it matches the acting of the principal characters they tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects but set in the backdrop of a badly made film it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable the only way this film could be considered scary is with the cheap haunted house boo scare tactics like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder why would they choose mary lambert to direct this film she barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos and as expected beyond this flop she has barely done anything worth mentioning well except for more music videos and the follow up stinker sequel to this film lets hope the re make is better 
short but good nude scene disappointing movie well if you want to see angelina jolie young and naked in a short one time scene this is the movie to buy if you don t then leave the movie alone it s just another teen rebelion movie 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
stick with the disney version when i watched the version with paul ruebens as the title character i liked it so i decided to watch this with my little brother i did not like this movie at all i feel bad for feeling that way cause jonathan taylor thomas was great in the lion king man of the house and home improvement but this movie is not enjoyable or watchable at all 
the end of a great show begins the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the s it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series it was a travesty to see optimus prime the greatest of the transformers fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor rodimus prime who proved incapable of leadership galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie they were forgettable it amuses me that fans are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did as a fan i was insulted perhaps these other fans have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage 
exploitation versus art ingmar bergman s oscar winner and wes craven s shocker tell the same tale there is an interesting comparison to be made between ingmar bergman s classic the virgin spring and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired last house on the left by wes craven they share identical plots feature graphic rape scenes and before it s all over turn average men into murderers and yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and s oscar winning best foreign film and the other appreciated only in underground circles but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation so just how different are they not as different as you might imagine but as different as art and exploitation the virgin spring is easily one of bergman s most accessible films telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren t accustomed to seeing a young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy though they initially seem helpful their actions quickly become violent after a graphic for the time rape the girl is murdered later the wrongdoers happen upon the girl s home and seek shelter from her family both groups unaware of who the other is suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought it is a powerful tale of love loss and the depths people can be driven into where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code where savagery and rage take over bergman s film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by max von sydow as the father real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it s a winning combination but what endures in the story of the virgin spring is how strong a component faith becomes when there is nothing left to believe in can you still believe a classic in every sense the virgin spring still has the power to shock but there s something very redemptive about the film last house on the left however is probably more notorious than acclaimed the plot as i ve said is identical coming years later in wes craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale it is a shocker and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the torture cinema of today it is brutal uncompromising and graphic and the film was championed in the underground horror market working with a small budget the film lacks the artistry of the virgin spring while it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock what it lacks is depth and subtlety the characters aren t particularly drawn out so their actions don t have the emotional resonance of the earlier film without contemplating faith and moral choices what we re left with is straightforward revenge and the film ultimately has no redemption no uplift it s violence for the sake of violence it remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it s own right and therein lies the difference between art and exploitation kgharris 
prom night years ago a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends and decide to keep a secret years later when they re all in high school the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them your typical s horror film not very notable other than leslie nielsen and jamie lee curtis this is one prom better left unattended 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone

what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha 
pul eese why did they have to make this movie i have only one question about this movie and that is why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book if you haven t read the book than you don t know what i m talking about but if you have then you do i can t even begin to explain how good of a movie this would ve been if it had been adapted correctly half the time while watching this i felt as if i was watching teletubies or something the colors were so bright if this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes locations characters and details from the story then everyone would love it not just year olds it makes me so angry when i watch this movie yes its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing everytime i loan someone the book i have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all in fact it is a hundred times better more even i am really disappointed i just don t get how gail carson levine would agree to all the changes that were made if someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie than i suggest they do it right and if they do then i ll be very thankful i just don t get it the book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better you wouldn t believe how much better it is i am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book next time please please do it right 
sour note no wonder they didn t produce any other live action productions of dr seuss books until after his death this film gave me a headache the direction and pacing of the film is flat the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring inexplicably nominated for an oscar ! the acting was wooden the sets were garish and ugly at least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of dr seuss works were i think dr seuss works best in small doses like the short animated tv shows that were made some thirty odd years ago do check out the gerald mcboing boing cartoon thats included on the disc it contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than dr t does in ninety minutes 
dvd purchase the dvd came in a timely manner packaged well and i have had no problems with the item it seems to be in great condition 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
embarrasing to watch i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i couldn t find anything about this film i remember enjoying it s a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty s character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an s kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you ll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more 
not even good when i purchased devils rejects this movie came free i watched it and hated it its about a sick individual who is on the internet trying to get women to come over for a party when they do he torchers them with hooks piercings the whole nine yards after he is cought he is put into a mental institution when he comes back as a nice guy the town people still want him dead he gets beat up so slowly he tries to take on some of the town people by now he then goes back for the girl that escaped and well doesnt live because her father kills him its not a good movie at all 
pretentious and mediocre this is by far the most pretentious piece of french crap i have seen in years what bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes but rather the banality of the film s underlying idea which the director gaspar noe attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion the characters are not shown in any depth in fact there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer camera work is simply awful somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art apparently these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cinma vrit in short even though in france almost every baker is an artiste think baguette artisanale mr noe is not a cinaste even by french standards hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
the mothman travesty three problems with this film pacing the film s pacing doesn t vary it s very boring as a matter of fact this wouldn t be a problem if the film were much more tense eg speed however this film lacks the high action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed effects too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions and there is an overabundance of high speed imaging the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling horror scenes furthermore they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film s plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole the upshot the film relies too heavily on the art of editing to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting triviality the plot s conclusion quails in the face of the so what question the viewer is left with a sense of i sat through the film for that in light of points and this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake dont waste your life alon 
like almost totally gross although valley girl came out when i was a teenager it somehow eluded me until now i bought it because of the favorable reviews and of course for the sheer nostalgia i won t say it s a bad movie but i would compare it directly to the last american virgin in terms of screenplay story and acting unlike the last american virgin however this film has an awful sountrack and it didn t really end in a notable way from a filmmaking standpoint this seems amateurish apparently this is where director martha coolidge cut her teeth because she went on to direct the remarkably good college film real genius just two years later the big problem with this film is shallowness we never learn much about any of the characters so it s not easy to care about them i still can t figure out why the lead characters were attracted to each other since the only way they ever describe each other is hot they never engage in deep conversations or share secrets with each other there s no depth to the relationship at all another problem is that all the high school students in this film appear to be about years old while the sexy mother of one teenage girl appears to be under years old herself a whole subplot that revolves around the mother beth played by lee purcell is unsatisfactorily resolved about half way throught the film then never mentioned again even so i like her temptations a lot more than stifler s mom in american pie lisa foreman s lead character julie behaves less like a valley girl of the s than she does an ordinary middle class teenager living in overland park kansas if you re familiar with moon unit zappa s song valley girl you ll find almost none of that kind of language in this film nicolaus cage s character randy is likeable enough but he looks more like a member of jefferson starship than a punk his almost mullet like hair is blown upward on top thats it unfortunately for an odd couple story like this to work you need to emphasize the extreme difference between the characters but these characters could have easily been neighbors from childhood they don t seem at all from the other side of the tracks the obligatory montage scene fails because it continues for the entire length of the song ill melt with you a montage is meant to compress time and dragging it out for an entire song defeats that purpose they should have faded it out after seconds for more effect the most entertaining characters in the film by far are julie s parents a couple of former hippies who were obviously the prototype for berke lander s parents in the hilarious teen film get over it the soundtrack too is terribly inferior to the last american virgin and doesn t represent the early s well at all only the aforementioned ill melt with you stands out as a great song meanwhile a tune that repeats the question johnny are you queer seems oddly out of place at a preppy high school prom from a nostalgia standpoint i didn t feel like i was watching an s movie at all in fact the most pleasant nostalgia in the film was seeing ashtrays on every table even though the characters didn t smoke which reminded me for the first time in years that california was once part of a free country and wasn t always ruled by neurotics frankly i was surprised that the orwellian thought police hadn t airbrushed all those ashtrays out of the film today every surface in california is littered with a fear mongering proposition warning stickers instead i m so grateful i was a teenager in the s rather than today overall this film fails on too many counts to recommend it but i wouldn t blame you for checking it out it s good enough fun for minutes the special edition dvd adds quite a few features that make the dvd worthwhile if you can get it cheap ! 
ah huh what the a tale of revenge why does everyone in their review say that b c it s written on the box cover this is an interesting and compelling movie but w a very odd abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the rewind button and saying what a minute is it over did i miss something afte watching this i scoured the internet wikipeida and amazon still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film my takeaway on it she is going to hang and die go to heaven he is going to stay on earth but maybe when they meet again heaven they can get married how come no one else can come up w a definitive meaning to the end of this film subtlety is great but not if it s so damn ambiguous that nobody in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about it was not about revenge maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair sorry can t really recommend this one ! 
dreadful i recall this movie fondly unfortunately the dvd quality is so poor this cannot be watched pity amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings don t waste your time until someone cleans this up but it makes a nice coaster though 
no title what a disappointment ! i remember siskel and ebert raving over this romantic comedy romantic maybe but comedy never very predictable plot from beginning to end and rosie perez was truly offensive a few times i couldn t understand what she was saying there is no way i could buy that she and cage s character were attracted to each other maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex violence or rough language although cage does get shot in one hold up scene it was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way i am beginning to like cage more and more as he ages spoiler i was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners either they shouldn t have changed it so much or they shouldn t have let us know about the real story it was based on end of spoiler but fonda and cage were very engaging together 
i ve seen wayyyy better even fonda s hotness couldn t save it i have never saw the original nikita merely because its hard to find i settled with the american remake as a last resort insted it can t be that bad its got a few legendary actors in it like gabriel byrne harvey keitel anne bancroft in it not to mention my childhood dream woman bridget fonda damn is she sexy but boy was i so wrong anyways the film is very violent for all the wrong reasons has swearing for all the wrong reasons even a drug addict like fonda wouldn t mouth off everytime she opens her mouth thats not the girl i fell for the pace is every sloppy its hard to believe how many holes in the screenplay there are for such a simple story what is the major problem is its lack of plot you just sit there after her missions not knowing what will happen its unpredicable in a bad way there are no twists off any kind i found the ending quite stupid it seemed like an easy way out because the movie was almost at its hour point after the credits i felt dissapointed as for the actors the beautiful bridget fonda puts in a good one in my book her blank stares are quite annoying but her sexy angry look works so well for this movie gabriel byrne one of favourites puts in a kind but strict performance as he gradually becomes a father kinda love interest figure to fonda who wouldn t fall in love with her the two work well together i ll give you that r ip anne bancroft forever mrs robinson to me is also scrict but very understanding to fonda its also good to see her in films now that she passed away around years ago i think finally harvey keitel good in his early career is very dull at this point but since his playing a character who is dull and coldhearted lets nothing get in his way has no attachments and is plain evil works for this movie i guess you see how generous i am to the actors i could be mean to them for being in a so so movie but i like them too much to say bad things about them oh did i mention i think bridget fonda is sexy 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
who would want to kill the sweetest woman in the world i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why don t you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichd rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i hadn t forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was fast furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he s a refugee from the outsiders but the movie s not a total wash after all it s got a great soundtrack 
menotti amahl and the night visitors i purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed i have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy i remember watching not only the first broadcast on nbc but several broadcasts years after that with different casts it was and still is my favorite christmas story i will certainly purchase the schippers cd and hope to see another video or dvd in the future 
moon river this movie is all wet overacted boring horrible movie the only likable character was cat 
oy vey most of the criticisms levelled against this video are valid with the glaring exception of the one directed at nico castel will there never be a quality dvd version of this opera or of one of menotti s other fine works goya does anyone still actually use the vhs medium 
a letdown from national lampoon this could have been a good movie the premise was ripe for exploitation and nobody exploits the stupidity of people in general and young people in particular better than national lampoon they are the acknowleged masters of the exploitation genere movies with absolutely no redeeming social value that still leave you laghing in this case however they exploited only their reputation the premise is of a couple of young idiots looking for an easy life without work hey its worked for years they fail at just about everything including purse snatching and armed robbery finally they hit upon a scheme to marry a couple of rich spinsters and wait to collect the inheritance there is a problem though in that the spinsters are hard up for cash as well and conceive of a plot to marry the dumb kids who tried to mug them insure them heavily and then kill them for the payout it had so much potential for comedy and it falls flat there are a few moments of brief humor but they are far too few and far between most of my time was spent agonizing surely it will get better it didn ti almost gave this one a single star what kept me from doing so is that there are a few movies out there that are even worse unfortunately i have seen some of them buy this one if you must complete your national lampoon collection or if you want something to distract you from the pain of a root canal otherwise don t bother even renting is a stretch 
hitler making speeches in a cave when this movie began i was sure i was in for something penetrating and deep as it went on i felt that the movie was merely clever within a few minutes of that i was just plain bored the premise hitler his colleagues and a few random nazis in a surreal underground world akin to hell has potential but the movie becomes tedious for lack of any plot or of any pretense of one the whole movie is given over to listening to hitler make speeches about heroism propaganda and other abstract concepts for the sake of variety his speechifying is occasionally interrupted by comments from goebbels goering eva braun and others having hitler talk with sigmund freud was evidently intended to be the cleverest stroke of all freud however is portrayed as a bland ordinary tv stereotype of a psychologist the only way we know he s supposed to be freud is the beard and the pince nez 
horrible i was forced to watch this movie for college it was the most vulgar unnecessary piece of junk i have ever seen this is a perfect example of the demoralization of america 
sliding scales this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played eight women is the story of well eight women who are trapped by a snowstorm all inches of it the man of the house has been murdered in the night young and old black and white of different classes the women must try to determine who the killer is eight women is also a movie about secrets of which everyone seems to have several the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france yet the first of the film is tolerable funny and even a bit interesting the characters are self interested and fun there s dotty old grandma a prissy hysterical virgin aunt the dead man s vampish sister and coltish young maid two daughters a somber yet elegant wife catherine deneuve and a black cook plenty of class and age tension to make three movies did i mention the music every twenty minutes or so one of the characters breaks into song these are always those stereotypical french songs full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime that are tedious to american ears and bizarre while one character sings the rest do slow little dances strange by the mark i was going to give this quirky film stars but soon the plot line spun out of control getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
really bad this movie was so awful what a waste of money i love johnny depp but this is sooo bad it is overplayed to the point where it s just dumb it was really boring as well with no plot really really bad acting and overplayed 
extremely annoying if you like action flicks with absolutely no intelligence this movie will appeal to your deepest of hearts but for those of you who prefer a plot and something that makes at least a little sense skip it a sports camera crew sets out to find the most daring of extreme sports heroes so that it can film an action movie in the alps they recruit a couple of crazy snow boarders helicopter pilots willing to outrun avalanches and then they toss in a pretty and dainty olympic skier for good measure and some eye candy the entire film consists of the frilly skier competing with the fearless snow boarders for attention and film time they get thrown out of helicopters at high altitude without any oxygen and wearing barely any clothes but they never freeze funny how that happens in movies ! the real amazing feat is how they ski downhill in front of a major avalanche and can still talk to one another have you ever heard how loud an avalanche is thank goodness for those sub atomic hearing aids eventually european terrorists enter the picture and a few automatic weapons something has to encourage those slow moving avalanches well you know how it goes the action is great and if you like skiing some of the stunts are literally unbelievable but other than that i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone with half a brain because you will just be frustrated with all of the impossibilities and missed reasons for people to die i only watched it because i was forced into it by a couch potato with a remote 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
jason takes manhattan they should ve just called it friday the th titanic this has got to be the most s est movie ever it completeley ruined the friday the th series jason did not have hair and was deformed as a childhe was on a boat for most of the movie and appeared in new york at the end why the hell did jason turn back into a boy at the end when he melted in the toxic wastejason s face is just f ing stupid at the end i mean seriously he looks like zippy from f ing rainbow why did they even make it 
typical rom com for genre bullockaffleck fans only if you ve seen one you ve seen them all uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl she brings him out of his shell well i bought this for like two dollars and maybe it was worth it i watch it like once a year no special features on dvd worth mentioning ben affleck is getting married he has to fly down to the south from ny for the wedding but things keep getting in his way forces of nature also he keeps running into and can t seem to get away from some weird chick bullock are these signs should he stop being so uptight and go with this free spirited chick or should he be an adult and get married and accept his vanilla lifestyle the acting in this movie is meh meaning sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie and affleck sucks as usual the other small parts are well done for the most part the script is formulaic and the cinematography at times is interesting it s just another rom com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell the movie opens with a stripper scene no nudity there is also a pot smoking scene in this movie there is also a scene where affleck strips at a gay bar just thought i d throw that in in case you re considering buying this for your teen daughter or something and that kind of thing bothers you you only need to buy this is you are a rom com fanatic or a big fan of either affleck or bullock otherwise this is completely forgettable 
great book bad movie good actors my view is skewed i was in va and flew with steve oonts a few times as a b n his book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the aa intruder into the public eye people would tell me about their experiences while reading the book they did not know my connection to it steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin while the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port it did not convey the excitement of the book so i was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try w stewart tittle lt usnr 
it was ok i think pretty raw outlook in the life of basquiati m an avid fan so i have no regrets having this 
slice of life i ve seen the phrase slice of life used many times to describe this movie which makes me wonder whose life is this a slice of certainly not mine and not most people s the anniversary party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain self absorbed jaded and rich beyond most people s wildest fits of imagination worse there isn t much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people or at least most people who are fun to be around don t act the way these characters do good films can be made about hollywood in mulholland drive it s kind of a dream world both in the sense that it s hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it in state and main the self absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement the anniversary party is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters but i can t imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who isn t also a bored rich prick if this is truly a slice of life for the hollywood set it is no wonder that so many films produced in hollywood are so cynical and shallow 
not jet s worse but man was that bad now obviously the new rap music and great american voices they put on make it as bad as possible but then again the movie certainly is no gem in it s original language version that is for sure the whole movie had above average action sequences but the story was unbearable not the story itself but the execution of it is the worst possible it goes from sickening moments to almost little kid parts between jet and teh girl just freaking horrible so the dvd is full screened music is stupid voice dubbing is almost as bad as the jet li collection movies but you will get a few good points one or two good laughs and a decent finale 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
save your money i bought this dvd based on the excellent reviews as both an afficionado and practitioner of kink i am always looking for a good film in that genre not only is maitresse poorly acted but the story line is completely unbelievable i also found the film quality leaving a lot to be desired poor lighting i found myself falling asleep about a third of the way through and just could not get into it the relationship and communication between the domme and her clients was cold and unfeeling and left me with the impression that i had just watched two robots doing physical things with each other there was just no chemistry between the players save your money 
hysterical and then just bad mostly i cannot with good conscience recommend this movie please look at it ! it s awful drew barrymore in her sad poison ivy stage is a wretched performer there are pothole plothole s all over the place and it s itchy to watch the scene with her real mother jaid barrymore were they attempting reconcilliation through a b movieoh and the guy from adventures in babysitting father of the bride a few episodes of friends is in it fumbling around too where is that guy theres a tough broad friend a spooky house at one point spoiler drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy hey now it sounds kind of good again 
dumb performances everything is this movie seems out of place the old cliche quotgood cop bad cop quot lived by sutherland and his pal doesn t work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance totally unconvincing unreal flat anyway it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time 
more like and a half stars before i get started with my review i must say one thing im not just a mindless hater trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise i liked the original movies with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman with that being said here is why i really didn t like this movie i felt it was too long and drawn out too much time was spent on lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left she whined to her reporter friend she whined to her husband she whined to clark kent she whined to her boss and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick comic flick and although the soundtrack was stunning at times too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough basically im saying this movie was melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and action and although the action scenes where pretty cool it is nothing we haven t seen before in a superman flick or any other super hero flick acting wise i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job nothing compaired to reeves but im not going to complain about that too much he was servicable and noone can complain about kevin spacey he is just awesome although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex did not like louis lane too whiney story wise this movie didnt really make much sense it was way too out there i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go yeah lets move there and lex is going to make lots of money not likely i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work i mean most criminals want their power now instant gratification maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline i just think they could have thought of something better and more feasable this movie was alright it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about minutes of melodrama away and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
could have been so much better i have to say that i am not familiar with any of the old shaft episodes or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i cannot make any comparisons to other sources nor can i take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have therefore coming from someone that did not know of shaft prior to the film i have to say that i was rather disappointed the acting is about average with the exception of samuel jackson who carries out his performance very well as always and jeffrey wright who really steals the show as basquiat the gangster regarding the plot it is weak the chances that the character walter wade jr would provoke and then deliver as he does are way beyond slim the desperate need to demonize what w w jr represents gets tiring after the first or so movies ! enough is enough ! the same applies for main characters with chips on their shoulders let s move on please as for having vanessa williams who is gorgeous play in this film and not have a single nude scene in this r rated movie with her is such a waste though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really no masterpiece here 
would ve given it nil stars if i could ve dated derivative self indulgent unintelligent this is truly bottom of the range stuff the acting directing soundtrack and script are all dire none of the characters are even remotely sympathetic in fact i was hoping they d die slowly and painfully i note that billy bob thornton was both star and a scriptwriter methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose an arrogant amoral misogynistic self important coward with zero sense of humour don t waste your time watching this drivel it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
a b movie with a little more substance michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion he has done such great b movies as this q and it s alive island of the alive how awesome is he anyways i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously thinking that it is going to be your typical movie but you shouldn t because not only is this a b movie but it is supposed to be funny my favorite part is when the stuff started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it who would do that i just started laughing by butt off when that happened so if you watch this movie just sit back and enjoy it for what it s worth don t be too critical on it what i learned from the stuff dairy products are evil ! especially if they come from with in the earth if you like the stuff i recommend watching other b movies such as island of the alive zombi and etc 
stupidity i ve never given one star to any type of produce before but the stupidity of this dvd and its fans are shocking so revealing ! so true ! if you didn t know fast food was unhealthy give me a break if you think this is realistic give me a break supersize me is a piece of propaganda meant to turn people away from eating mcdonalds food the film documents morgan spurlock embarking on a perilous quest to eat three meals of mcdonalds per day this diet has rules too whenever he is asked if he wants a meal to be super sized he must do it he also much try each item on the menu at least once he is only allowed to consume items that are in fact on the menu the thing is though if he is really trying to make a valid point why does he order the double quarter pounder with cheese meal twice within the first seven days this is questionable because not only is this the most fatty item on the menu it also made him vomit the first time that he ate it all the thing is though millions of people some skinner than spurlock have this meal and do not throw up why him his wife is a vegan chef and he is used to having no meat in his diet so why would he choose the biggest item on the menu twice in the first week there are many many other items that he couldn t possibly been able to cover not only that he almost gets no exercise during the month of this experiment saying that the average american gets little exercise his laziness seems to be an exaggeration there is some merit to the movie showing people how unhealthy mcdonalds is but everyone knows that they just don t care for spurlock to in any way even the subtlest of ways to support the idiots who sue the fast food chains because they became obese is ludicrous it should be mentioned that wendy s regular hamburger is a quarter pounder while mcdonalds regular burger is th of a pound also wendy s goes up to a triple quarter pounder something mcdonalds has never done burger king introduced the triple cheese burger and quadrouple cheese burger something mcdonalds has never done it seems that mcdonalds is picked as a scapegoat because it is the most popular this movie may have been more credible if it examined the dangers of fast food as a whole but just to go up against the one corporation is stupid if the movie didn t suggest that the corporation doesn t care about it s customers i wouldn t have a problem but it does too much of anything especially food is bad for someone if anyone needed a movie to tell them that fast food is unhealthy they clearly are seeing the world through a filter 
spend a couple hours of your life with vile people of all the hateful self centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie the one i found most offensive was the one involving emilio estevez andie macdowell isn t stalking hilarious and isn t kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you ve ever seen i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little kirby i also loved at the end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy and judd nelson that she just wants them all to be friends to which they both reply the classic cinema line ehhhh ok wow now that s drama 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
all lies an attack on america for what purpose these lies about the life of this man are the liberal film makers racists who don t believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest hurricane carter is not and was not that man factsin the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell they want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled times in a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved fact giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape the depitction is another lie another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder fact is that carter s boxing career was going down hill and he had only won of his last fights as carter s boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people while in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america shame norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn t care they just like the message looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet america bashing and race baiting is alive and well earning oscars and making for big box office a shame 
worst movie i have ever seen if it were possible to give this movie zero stars i would have although it may have won an academy award and been considered great in it s day it is now outdated and boring unless scenes of teenagers trying to have sex with anyone are interesting to you then maybe you will find it interesting when i say anyone i do mean anyone the main chracter sonny who is a teenager sleeps with ruth wife of his footbal coach and the young girl jacy sleeps with her mother s lover on a pool table the film also attempts to bring up homosexuality but keeps it muted you would think a movie called the last picture show would be more about a picture show but it really has very little to do with the movie there is some nudity which was huge for the time of it s release since it was practically unheard of the film is also completely in black and white which was a choice of the director so the film could give a better feel of the time period s this movie also gives a bad impression of those who live in the country making them look like they are so bored of their desolate surroundings that they must seek sex with anyone who is willing if this movie would have been made in present day it would be your typical porn movie but since none of the sex scenes are actually shown they just show the faces and i guess that is what it allows it to be called an award winning movie and not a porn also if you think the movie was bad try reading the book it was based off of much worse 
fascination where narcissism collides with eroticism looking for a really good thriller i spotted fascination with jacqueline bisset and was sure that with her and the cast my husband and i had found the perfect summer film on dvd what a disappointment although bisset rallies to the role the same cannot be said of the other actors the dialogue is painfully inept at conveying anything in the least bit sexy provocative or psychologically intriguing the cloying saccharine musical score doesn t help whereas the music in the swimming pool or the wide sargasso sea enhances heightens the dramatic intensity mystery and sensuality the musak in fascination undermines whatever potential drama there might be the characters other than bisset and her unfortunate first husband seem too infatuated with themselves to be erotically convincing as an ensemble cast they seem indifferent to both the story and their audience magnificent bodies and sexy entanglements are not enough in my opinion to compensate for the pedestrian acting and rather predictable plot jacqueline bisset deserves better and so do we viewers 
attack of the totally fake and unconvincing sharks how many modern day jaws rip offs do there need to be well ! okay this film i would rank lower than stars if it wasn t for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist the other reason was i think casper van dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him but this movie stunk in no ways does it compare to jaws nor even deep blue sea i hated almost every moment of it if you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy deep blue sea or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years don t be fooled this is a waste of time and effort this film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none 
worst one this one is perhaps the worst one i ve seen of the jason series i couldn t even sit though it all 
disappointed i bought the dvd hoping to see one skit the funniest one my family had ever seen on snl we had it recorded on vhs many many years ago and somehow lost it but we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits smiling laughing joking around man man who reminds me of my doggie hair head i thought for sure that the funniest skit in all of snl history would be on there but no it was just a second clip i was so disappointed ! and it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety they just weren t funny on a positive note there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the dvd that was so sweet it brought me to tears and the bonus featuring phil s audition was quite interesting but overall i don t recommend it

sentimental and fake having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i can t fathom the entire plot is self serving shallow and unrealistic i guess it s supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i don t condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who don t get it and it doesn t mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the writer director gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you can t keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it s not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that wouldn t bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself 
a must pass for true fans i have loved riverdance since the first time i saw it on pbs i could wait till i received my riverdance live from new york dvd so many years ago recently i had a chance to see it on tour when it came to los angeles i had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything i could hope for with the exception of them having removed the song home in the heartland which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle that night i ordered not only riverdance live from geneva but also jean butler s irish dance dvd which i would recommend to make a long story short don t waste your time with this version of the show the main female singer is absolutely horrible definitely doesn t hold a candle to katie macmahon s original vocals and the lead female dancer s too short hair drove me crazy do yourself a favor and purchase the dvd live from new york i promise you won t be disappointed 
you ve got to be kidding avoid this movie this movie was so bad how bad was it that i turned it off after about minutes this is only the second time in my life i stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done do not rent or buy this movie 
this movie is a clunker wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters 
tobe hooper s huge misfire after chainsaw and salams lot when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director to bad this one isn t a very good story this mess came out at the heigth of the slasher movie frenzy but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also the theme of kids who now hold on here think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival before you can say please kill me the thing is picking them off one by one with only teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen but no they just go for the tease scares and even at mins this bore last to long 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
please enter a title for your review obviously i knew going in that this movie wasn t going to offer anything more than light low brow entertainment but it falls below average for it s niche even low brow humour requires some degree of subtlety and context to work and those things seem mostly absent in this movie it s also disappointingly uneventful so much of the movie is set in the one house where not much progresses i was hoping the guys schemes would involve some detours to introduce additional environments and characters but it never happened the movie is generally pretty dark too drawing a lot of it s gags from murder attempts i guess it s a black comedy but it s not marketed as such i think it s inconsistent about what it wants to be trust the out of negative reviews on this site and don t waste your time with this movie unless you enjoyed big momma s house 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show

boring tacky watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled boring and tacky even by horror standards the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet hence the title i ve seen far worse but those worse movies were more quotenjoyablequot than this the following morning you probably won t remember having seen it if only the monster had eaten this movie s negative then we would all be spared 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
there s nothing wrong with the davis baby but there s something with the film itself although i knew this movie might not fit my expectations i still ordered all three parts in a box from british amazon much because of its cult status among horror fans actually i wanted to watch this since i was a boy and i was right as well as many reviewers i mean about expectations its alive appeared to be rather boring and not scary at all the only pluses i saw in it are great work by john p ryan i always adored him and that nostalgic feeling i got while watching and by nostalgic i mean the epoch of s itself shown in the film and the way movie was shot nowdays we used to see monsters from the first minutes on screen and in its alive we get to see the evil baby just closer to the end anyway i think the film lacks some brutality and real horror maybe they ll come up with something more infernal in the sequel which is being planned as i heard but in general its alive is quite ok for a low budget movie that doesn t claim to be a masterpiece of horror genre buy it if you like old cheesy horror films especially those which became legends a long time ago 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
four noble truths dragging on and on don t get it wrong i like the ideas and spirit of buddhism it is a religion and yet it is not insistent on belief my own view of it is that what people do is much more important than anything they believe but will be shaped by what they believe at least in part one of the things i like about a religion is when it emphasizes doing good i like it even more when the religion does not call upon people to have faith in something faith in the good outcome of good works and good attitudes is enough for me but i found myself struggling with one clear inexorable truth this set of dvd s was not well put together normally a tape or writing of the dalai lama is most interesting to hear or read but this seems to stem from some educational conference where what is being done is one of the most republican of all ventures preaching to the believers it is partly marred by the need for translation that would be very appropriate at an educational seminar unless you are in the mood to go back to school again i would recommend anything else taped or written by or about the dalai lama recently i have done little to suffer more than listen to and stop the world while hearing these two dvd s about the existence and cause and end of suffering yes the intelligence and good spirit of the dalai lama is clear in the dvd s but if the presentation is wrong even a william buckley would seem boring in these days of cheap electronics for instance i would recommend hiring a videographer who has access to good lighting and audio control and is able to cut and paste a little in the context of these dvd s buddhism would almost seem to be as dogmatic about these four truths all related to suffering and it s cures as some others are about the holy trinity as a somewhat non religious admirer of buddhism i am able to stand back and say clearly buy something else anything about by or regarding the philosophy or religion at the same time i must state that i would be more nervous and clearly on the receiving end of more knee jerk criticism for my critique where i disecting the views of some other famous religious figures whose followers would be so likely to have faith that not only would the criticisms fly by deaf ears but the shouts would be geared to drown out even so slight a criticism as to say that a set of tapes or discs is boring trusting that i will not lose my head over this it would seem to easy to be critical to the contrary it is a hard thing to do as i am an admirer of most everything that i think the dalai lama stands for i would only pray if you will that next time there s a seminar like this they pay more attention to detail in the production 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
woefully embarrassing this is not just a bad woody allen film this is a bad boring dull witted film period i have to assume that woody is now just completely senile as he comes across in the film and his handlers are walking him through the film production then slapping the allen name on the front to sell a few tickets scarlett johanssan hardly much of an actor in the first place comes across as stiff as an illiterate attempting read her lines from cue cards and woody ouch his timing is so far off i have to assume he missed a daylight savings time switch somewhere unless you re a seriously committed masochist don t waste your time or money on this disaster 
the ship sank this was one of mgm s worst musicals it s amazing because it had a lot going for it the casting of three beautiful talented women ann miller debbie reynolds and jane powell the script isn t too good vic damone and tony martin have too much of the same persona i think the movie would have been balanced with dean martin cast there is one scene that sticks out and it s a weird one with jane dancing with a penguin 
spend a couple hours of your life with vile people of all the hateful self centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie the one i found most offensive was the one involving emilio estevez andie macdowell isn t stalking hilarious and isn t kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you ve ever seen i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little kirby i also loved at the end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy and judd nelson that she just wants them all to be friends to which they both reply the classic cinema line ehhhh ok wow now that s drama 
land of oprahisms having avoided seeing this film i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on brought tuesdayunbiden into our home my aversion to oprah and her ilk does not cloud my dislike of this film a bad film is a bad film devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned and directionless directing this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward something should occur my interest should be engaged this film takes reams of pre packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses and attempts to build the plot from words alone it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said heythis book is full of words lets make a movie in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting to be honest jack lemmon was not very good in this film he played the same character he always did just older hank azaria was just awful he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones and was wooden and expressionless maybe he was too embarrased to be there as to the other actor s well they filled up the space nicely the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was they even covered the green leaves on the trees some better acting some good r rated dialogue and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film as it stands however it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr phil etc the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases a good cry and a genial talk show presenter will somehow make it all better ifor one think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial then pull the finger out and just get on with it to the grammar and form police i did have this in paragraphs but the editing process scrunched it all together sorry 
robert altman at his weirdest this film is evocative of the quirky madcap robert altman at his best and worst we got it because we have a bud cort fan in the family and just to see him makes it worth it but the story is strange resolution less than satisfying if you re really a big altman or cort fan then you must see it just be aware that this is not a western ! i had it confused with john wayne s quotrooster cogburn quot and the dennis weaver s quotmccloudquot and kept waiting for it to start thinking i was seeing more previews the storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the astrodome who is trying to fly with a murder mystery and detective story this is one of shelly duvall s early roles don t miss her upside down false eyelashes 
top or top worst ones one of the worst films ever absurd the whole story in adition tring to be an important deeply movie just pathetic don t even try to rent it don t even try to talk about it the sex scenes are awful too nothing to save nothing to see nothing really a full horrible experience 
not appropriate for children i agree with jane ! i bought this video for my four year old son because he s a spider man fanatic little did i know that this series is not meant for children when we started to watch with him i couldn t believe what i was hearing so i flipped the box over to find the rating never dreaming there was one since i bought this in a toy store right next to a stack of teletubbie videos there is a pgv rating on the back for violence but they don t tell you about the adult language as well as the sexual references needless to say we shut it off and tried to distract him with a more appropriate video for his age i don t know if i d let my year old watch this 
ewwww that smell this stinks buy flying daggers just plain hero or buy fong sai yuk at an online retailer 
don t even bother okay i was excited to see this movie i read a few non fiction books on the dot com bust and thought i knew a thing or two but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from i mean who cares about these people s relationships not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail this movie sucked 
better the nd time around with judicious use of the ff i came to this film with the attitude of enjoying a bit of ridiculous camp emma thompson and alan rickman sporting nawlins accents i couldn t pass that up well even with the right attitude coming in it was at times painful emma s dialect coach should have been shot alan did better at least he sounded like he was aiming at a southern accent but he tends to drawl a bit anyhow so maybe it was easier for him however emma and alan are only supporting characters the main characters are not terrible or anything but really not that compelling oh the plot the film does have a good plot and it could have been interesting but nonetheless i found it a bit plodding and as others have noted the editting is so weak it s comical oh actually there is a quite memorable scene the cunnilingus scene in a meat locker wow that was umunusualwell emma and alan fans will no doubt watch it but save it for a slow mid week night actually any emma fans with a sense of humor should definitely watch this at some point emma is obviously having a good time and seeing her dangle a cigarette while tailing on roller blades is something else it just you might not want to choose this as a film to watch with friends unless you want to expose the depths to which you will descend to watch emma or alan on the screen addendum alan plays a good character here it s a nice lite break if you ve been working through his films where he often plays morally ambiguous or not so ambiguous characters in films that explore difficult themes 
boring i bought this movie after reading the rave reviews on this site i have to say i was highly disappointed although the main characters are very likeable and their acting is good the disco type music in this so called scary movie was just annoying i also found the lovescene type music very inappropriate the type of music they used just made me hate the movie even more i was hoping for a haunted house theme in this movie and it just didn t deliver i will give this movie stars because i liked the main characters there are no gruesome murders or anything like that in this film 
what a bore i was amazed that you could take such an innovative tv show from the s and make it into such a boring movie action was slow and predictable casting was horrible even the cars weren t as good as in the tv show i am glad i only rented tis and didn t buy it don t waste these hours of your life on this flick 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
embarrasing to watch i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i couldn t find anything about this film i remember enjoying it s a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty s character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an s kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you ll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more 
a great film given the basest possible dvd treatment from fox lorber most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning srdjan dragojevic film at select film festivals in the u s have not forgotten its clarity its anger and its power the movie was passed up for theatrical distribution although it was readily available on vhs and now on dvd from fox lorber this dvd is a bust in every thinkable way although fox lorber was obviously aiming very low the phrase barebones is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary dismissive releases lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant this dvd does contain a trailer but the trailer sadly looks better than the feature barebones would have been fine but watching this disc is torture its obviously a quickie transfer from the vhs i could have produced a better amateur transfer with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout poor audio balance with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo poor contrast a muddy dark image burnt in subtitles and so forth fox lorber were long the scourge of the art film dvd market and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc new yorker and wellspring formerly winstar are guilty of similar offenses 
don t even bother watching this movie this movie is not at all for a hard core horror movie fan there was was way too much waiting around for something to happen butnothin ever did 
what s the point play this movie at x speed with the subtitle turned on and you won t miss a thing it has minimum dialog the main female character being mute and is painfully slow the dvd cover photo is misleading this is not a beautiful movie the characters are unattractive and the cinematography monotonous the people who say noone goes to the movies to have a bad time or to learn anything were proven wrong by the success of united which is not enjoyable but riveting the isle unfortunately is neither entertaining nor educational i am not a prude and appreciate a good erotic thriller but the only thing i m left with after watching this one is revulsion those who gave this movie stars are describing the emperor s clothes 
kundera was right to object the movie doesn t at all reflect the original book story in its core concept if i didn t read the book before i wouldn t be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain i doubt anybody based on the movie only would be able to understand what happend in in the czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society 
dvd buyer beware viewers hoping to see the controversial quotpistolquot scene in which mcgillis s character is forced by her jealous husband to open her legs for his gun will be disappointed to find that it has been cut from the r rated dvd version for that you ll apparently have to stick with the unrated vhs tape other than that the movie is a decent if unspectacular b thriller and the digital transfer is pretty good 
can t rate what i can t see brannagh s film version of hamlet blows away every other version as well as every other shakespeare based film it s an easy stars now the dvd is a different matter been hearing about and waiting for this for ages ! every lame oh shlock film holywood cranks out shows up on dvd and usually big projects like this are milked for every they can get with fancy packaging and special editions i was part of the project through which a small determined group of fans was able to bring the one season wonder my so called life to dvd and there must be close to as large an audience for this where is it 
easy come easy go should be for boats fans if you got elvis presley and dodie marshall and put them in the same film you will have easy come easy go an elvis presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love but anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an elvis presley fan will be un happy and elvis leading lady in this film is dodie marshall which i guess is a re make of a film with the same name came out in and this is one of final films that elvis sings the same song with somebody else and the song is yoga is as yoga goes he sings that with elsa lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher if you are an elvis presley fan then buy or rent jailhouse rock on video or dvd 
maybe a good film but not a true story warning spoilers there are so many reviews saying this is a true story i have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real obviously about everything else is dramatized including the mission objectives scud hunting on foot which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today mcnab has essentially written tom clancy genre fiction the book bravo two zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol chris ryan called the one that got away however both are convincingly debunked by a third sas memeber in a book called the real bravo two zero also available on amazon though only the uk amazon site which you can still order from in the us in it an sas member who can actually speak arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people mcnab and ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story most importantly he manages to restore without a doubt the reputation of vince phillips blamed by ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the iraqis and a couple members eventually killed contrary to what you may expect i would recommend seeing this in fact i recommend getting and comparing all three books b the one that got away and the real b 
ask yourself why warning a bunch o spoilers and common sense alert whydid the grand father have to be a perverted drug addict how i would have done it make him practicing for his upcoming geriactric pageant honestlythe movie might have been better without him most old folks are being portrayed as hippies hipsterssassy vixens and gruff guys anyway this of course would have killed off this movies nd biggest gimmick whydid the uncle have to be gay how i would have done it oka regular uncle isnt funny or gimmicky how about a gambler an uncle whos depressed suicidal over losing everything in poker while having only the second highest hand there is not only that but he loses everything to the loan shark who happened to be at the same table whywere the parents so feeble how i would have done it first off dont have anyone relative or not have control over a young child in your home in real life its not friends or neighbors who mess you up but family members i would have had the whole family participating in olives quest for shallowness of course that would have killed the movies biggest gimmick whywasnt there a pet added to the mix of dysfunctionit was the only gimmick left untapped how i would have done it to replace the cursing drug addict geezer and empty headed parents gimmicks id toss in pet skunk porcupine or rat some animal thats not a popular choice but is loved nonetheless whydid olives routine have to be an audition for her future stripping gig how i would have done it while my idea wouldnt have been edgyit would have been more original have her be a magician and gramps be her eye candy assistant even more have her be good at it get those ugly pets to par take as well make the done up midgets and their loser parents feel ridiculous not by being outrageous but showing her talent sif contestants arent allowed to have assistants no prob have her be good at her tricks while still involving said animals and have rick james be her soundtrack having olive win despite not being little miss pretty would have been the way id go the stuff that worked dad having difficult time living his dream son having will power of some sort attempting his not speaking is a good a choice as any a family conflict of any kind and having them come through it even stronger the bus im not completely sure what message this little movie was trying to get across dreams cant get crushed even though the ones you place your dreams success upon are the ones crushing them shrugs uncaring shoulders uncaringly 
pretty forgotten by now the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that s a bad sign that the movie isn t going to be great ill try and remember that next time the only reason i am giving the fogotten stars is the scene with alfe woodward you ll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that s it happy viewing 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
bad from beginning to end not sure what is worse the horrible script or the horrible acting typical mean girl makes epiphany and changes to good person script watching schneider dress in women s clothes for an entire movie is just creepy using lemon juice for eye drops would be more enjoyable than watching this movie 
buy the rhino version this movie is my favorite movie ever i feel terrible giving it two stars but it gets stars because i am comparing it to the rhino version which i also own i also own the original vhs i have watched this movie at least once a year since i was except for about years in middle school hs i can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head buy the rhino version if you can t find the rhino version this isn t half bad its just that that version is much better and since i have been growing up with older copies the new one s flaws minor to the newcomer are blinding to me i also am physically unable to watch any of the special edition star wars because of those changes if that gives a clue to my movie anality buy the rhino version if you can find it one complaint is that the vhs had this cool glitter effect in a couple of scenes involving energon and unicron internals it is present in the vhs it came out wrong in the rhino version and was totally gone in the th thanks for deleting part of my childhood in comparison to the rhino version the remaster is terrible mine seems to flicker and have strange artifacts the colors are totally off hot rod is basically magenta pink instead of red and his orange is not orange like an orange it is orange like a cheaply made basketball widescreen is fake it is a cut fullscreen i wish you weren t such a liar sony cover art d no detail looks like whoever does the new show drew it in an afternoon or two the matrix looks like a honeydew it would have got an f but prime is on there very few of the extras were worth it i bought this for the remaster hoping for some clean up and a restoration of the glitter effect and they weren t there 
name of this movie should have been named gee zeera when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media 
not good but what other choice do you have first of all i would like to start off by saying that this movie sucks here are a few of the things that supports my decision dacascos does not know capoeira he played the berimbau an insrument used in capoeira wrong he pronouced many of the terms incorrectly and he had no flow to his movements the acting was horrible while watching this you kind of get the picture that the director wanted to finish this movie a soon as possible most of the lines were just stupid dacascos character had no real history apparently had this mysterious past you really could care less about because the plot was so predictable the fighting was laughable at best capoeira is the only martial art that was outlawed for being so violent and unstoppable you don t need corny fight scenes to show it s usefulness most of the fight scenes where repeated movements that were shot at different angles dacascos was doing meia lua s a spinning kick in which both hands are on the ground as you strike that were knocking out three people at once in one ridiculous scene saverio the drug lord pointed to where he wanted dacascos to stand so that he could miraculously appear behind him and perform and unchallenged jumping kick to the back of his head i wish an experinced capoeirista would have done the fight scenes although this movie was horrible it is the only movie in which capoeira is suppose to be the main artform used while watching this movie one can only hope that this poor performance dosen t hurt capoeira s chances at being the cornerstone of another movie 
sorry this movie is so freakin stupid yes its funny but so very dumb not good dumb bad dumb terribly painfully stupid funny at times best avoided or taken in small doses 
worst episode ever this was by far the worst episode of this show the first minutes were dominated by the boring howard and his sister bonnie stern if you think anna s cousin shelly was a trainwreck check out these two together on tv keep these people off tv please talk about total trainwrecks however it was amusing to see anna babysit and work at the cafe this didn t redeem the mess howard and his repulsive sister made of the first minutes 
well make a bumpia out of columbia rko filed for bankruptcy in the mid s and was on the verge of finally getting back on their feet financially by i suspect that someone from their cost accounting group wandered into the studio commissary in and found it full of under contract actors and production staff goofing off and eating studio food they rounded up this group stuffed the whole bunch onto an unused sound stage with a leftover southwestern set and got them singing and dancing to songs from a rogers and hart broadway show which they had an option on but had deemed unworthy of feature film treatment the result was released as too many girls financially practical because with almost everything already paid for insert fixed cost here the additional expense of actually producing something boiled down to a little electricity and some black and white film stock no good reason to track this one down it s pretty witless as a comedy with the miscasting making for funnier moments than anything else in the film everyone except ann miller is too old to be playing college students and they try to pass hal le roy one of hollywood s most effeminate actors off as a college football all american i generally like this kind of stuff and will sit through anything to watch ann miller so if it totally turned me off it is unlikely to appeal to most viewers mostly it is notable for what happened off camera as lucy and desi made their first connection some of the musical numbers by rodgers and hart were bearable heroes in the fall and pottawatomie trudy erwin dubs lucy s only song francis langford does most of the other numbers mildly wild heiress connie casey lucille ball returns from finishing school in europe with an unusual request to attend her father s alma mater in new mexico pottawatomie college you mean a lot to me pottawatomie you hit the spot of me pottawatomie i love pottawatomie with all my anatomy so every tot of me that is begot of me will go to pot pot pottawatomie lucy was almost at the time and even with extreme soft focus and minimal close ups can t remotely pass for her father suspects that she has a boyfriend at the school and hires four ivy league football stars to monitor the behavior of the new freshman the four eventually end up playing for the school s hapless football team which in a matter of a few days has changed its schedule to include games with big time programs like nebraska columbia and tennessee there is a grand celebration at which the student body sings the following less thanimmortal lyrics youre a ham better scram notre dame we ll make williams wail army you too navy boo hoo to purdue georgia tech day you ll dread youre a wreck look at brown turn blue we ll make a bumpia out of columbia in a quota minnesota s got to go you ll see u of d we ll have all the alphabet to shout out reviewers note the u of d is the university of detroit which was once a football power the scale of this thing is ultimately its undoing as broadway ensembles of are replaced with a cast of hundreds remember all those people sitting in the rko commissary drawing paychecks for doing nothing on risqu broadway the girls who are still virgins wear beanies in the film they wear them to signify that they have never been kissed it is amusing to watch these aging and jaded rko starlets trying to pass for ultra chaste teens there is a corny and unconvincing romance between lucy and richard carlson whose brand of wooden acting would eventually work to his advantage in s science fiction films like it came from outer space then again what do i know i m only a child 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
yawn i m no expert on film much less french new wave i just like to explore a bit so i picked this up because i heard it was considered to be influential and because the idea of richard crenna being in something like this struck me as amusing i liked the ocean siren bit at the beginning quite a lot but the ultra slow pace lost me soon after that it s also a bit difficult to watch the train helicopter bit at the end with an unjaded eye it just didn t captivate me 
very poor except for rory block s performance i agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter however the couple of minutes where rory block sings quotif i had possession over judgement day quot are worth the entire price of this dvd don t buy the tape cos you ll have to sit through so much stuff you won t make it but on the dvd you can go straight to rory block and never watch the rest 
death of common sense it s hard for me to believe that so many people think this is a brilliant and startling film how could you not know that eating so much fast food is unhealthy if this film is considered groundbreaking then i fear for our republic 
memorable orientalia wasted on poor film stock being an oriental i am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours although not as extensive as standard hollywood productions with japanese films whether it was made by a kurusawa or a more obscure artisan i can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in pace inconspicuously lacks background music instrumentals and are generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively substandard village of dreams while touted as an award winner is a glaring testimony of this stunted japanese film making characteristic review it yourself the pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing it was the same character that can be seen even in kurusawa s ran a quothighly acclaimed quot work that in my case i couldn t even view for the third time because even its dvd resolution has a quality that can only be likened to the eye view of a person who s suffering his earliest stage of creeping glaucoma village of dreams is so quotrelaxedquot as if the filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they enjoyed in s japan in an obscure countryside at the very least the straight narrative of this film is a consolation but with ran the actions were so hard to follow you d be puzzled who was fighting and attacking whom the most unforgivable quality of this dvd transfer is the poor film stock the picture approximates that of a quotthird generation quot recording of a vhs copy this means that you ll be sorely dissapointed of having to get a vhs quality copy copied in turn from another vhs copy which was copied from the original vhs quotmaster tape quot of course the dvd transfer is not at fault its simply that the japanese despite their touted techno prowess just couldn t give us a decent film stock that could at least preserve their comparatively well made gems the glaring deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious when shown on high resolution tvs i ve viewed this film in a inch sony wega flat tv and in a inch mitsubishi projection tv from a pioneer dvl and if not for the antics of the two children leads village comes off as wearisome i bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because i m a film collector its works like this that whets my appreciation for world cinema unfortunately village s poor resolution takes away gratifying cinematic enjoyment as well as negating its quotcollectabilityquot factor this should have looked more glorious if it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like what dreams may come or dark city but of course that s asking too much from those editing challenged japanese filmakers i want to ask amazon for a refund because this is not well worth its price value i was compulsed to buy it because of its cover i thought it was at least as exotically glorious looking as kundun but it proved to be just a small obscure production critics may raved about it just like those canadians did with black robe but the final word is that they re just run of the mill albeit thoughtful films 
stick with the classic the bad seed instead this must have seemed like a great idea at the time cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor the problem is his range is all the way from a to b this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many chance happenings in the end all we get is this thrillerand i use the term very loosely that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling

brings back memories but ultimately it disappoints yep like many viewers i watched this when i was too young and was scared for like weeks on end and couldnt get the tall man image out of my head well when this got re released i just had to have it figuring it would bring back memories and really allow me to get into once again unfortunately because i am now older and hopefully a little wiser the film ends up being a rather cheesey horror movie with a mix mash plot and no tension or scary moments whatsoever hey i wasnt looking for a dustin hoffman like performance in a horror movie but geeez the acting was pretty rough and forced the plot started off pretty cool but then began to not know what to do with itself and got almost silly towards the end the mausoleum itself was eerie but the dwarf guys star wars jawas were pretty funny and the whole thing just didnt add up as always in horror films a quick call to the police is all it would have taken to stop this tall man but no lets grab the trusty shotgun and take care of it ourselves c monthe scene with the plastic bug in the jacket made me laugh outloud and i rewound it just to get another laugh the film makers had to know how silly this looked didnt they i hope that scene was supposed to be tongue incheek or the film makers need to rethink their film careers and of course the thought process of the characters just didnt make any logical sense i wont go into details you ll see what i mean when you watch the movie oh yeah the mustard covered fingers was also a classic laugh moment the silver fyling ball is still cool as hell and that alone earned the movie an extra star rating from me i do like jody he tries to do the right things for the most part and has that waaaay cool cuda that he drives around little mike was just a young kid and you almost felt bad for him losing so many people he cared for it had to be tough however that doesnt excuse the inherent silliness of the movie or the plot that just doesnt unfold correctly or logically maybe i expected too much maybe i ve become an overly critical movie watcher but nontheless i cant recommend this other than for a quick watch rent it dont buy it since it has really zero redeeming qualities or multiple viewing value this could have been soooooo much better with a the proper direction and a little more time put into the films flow it was a great concept for horror sci fi thrown in with mystical elements as well great starting point and it was refershingly different as opposed to the usual kids go camping and get hacked by an ax murderer that you always see again though it was not polished at all and just didnt work well enough sorry if i ve burst the proverbial bubble of the movies fans but its a cult classic for a reason much like the rocky horror picture show the event is the real attraction for the fans the movie itself is horrible and pointless but fans dont want to face that fact so they hide behind the cult classic label hey whatever by the way the dvd quality is only average i expected a better transfer but on my plasma based home theater it was pretty grainy and not up to par with what a re release should be imo 
overt child exploitation that never redeems itself satisfyingly a well acted well portrayed sickening overt example of an adult whose sole desire for a child is based on getting that child to meet his own selfish needs he has little or no love for the child based on who the child is in her core and sends her the basic message that she does not count as a human being aside from being an object to gratify him if the child does not mold to his expectations and desires she gets rejected and this is the horrible tension of the movie although the movie has some twists and turns that shake things up the man s character never develops much in a satisfying way and nor do the basic themes of adult selfishness and cultural repression as such the movie is essentially non redemptive and portrays a sad and tragic side of humanity although this movie is set in an outer province on china in the s it s actually a good metaphor for western culture much as western cultural norms do not allow parents to exploit their children so overtly 
classic french new wave film bad for general audiences i watched this film as part of my history studies in post war europe and before everyone docks me because i gave it two stars hear me out i m no godard fan so i may not be able to appreciate this film as a fan of the new wave might i m just your regular joe movie watchermasculin feminin is about paul a yearold french citizen that just retired from his months in the army paul is a believer in marxism and throughout the film promotes the worker s party while denouncing us involvement in vietnam the du gaulle government and most forms of westernism such as condoms psychadelic rock many songs in masculin feminin have a style similar to the kinks jefferson airplane etc and even coca cola yet paul is often seen playing pinball and that mini bowling game you see at an arcade paul seems to be the pro french identity kind of guy as he often eats cheese and drinks wine the preserver of the romanticized french culture however paul s friends and interviewees paul works for the ifop the major french polling agency at the time seem to not care about the change towards a quasi american consumer state paul s girlfriend madelein is a rising pop singer her room mates are materialistic consumers one who owns a car and the people paul interviews seem to only care about themselves this is very accurate in terms of how the babyboom generation of french youth began to rebel against the traditionalist governments in europe like the teens in the s in the us the teens began to form their own demographic however this is where my fascination ends godard apparently never heard of music editing and film editing in many parts in the movie godard fixed the camera on one person s face in a portrait shot and kept it there for minutes at a time even though the scene was a minute back and forth conversation the volume in the music went from very high to very low instantly in many parts during dialogue making it very annoying if almost distracting to the audience in a few parts when paul was whistling the recording of the whistling obviously overloaded the sound buffer as i heard static in the speakers i thought this was a volume problem on my end so i turned it down nope it was the sound editing this is just poor recording and editing furthermore the sound editors had this fascination with using the same gun noise sound which sounded more like a cartoon car noise over and over and over again and in very unlikely times other times ambiant noises would drown out the dialogue such as vehicles from outside a cafe or even drinking noises sometimes the sound didn t kick in for up to five seconds into the scene because this is a french new wave film i won t attack how there is virtually no plot and has random scenes that are just plain silly however i strongly recomend not getting this film if you re just in the general audience and not a new wave fan otherwise you might like this new wave classic but i m no expert on the subject i was just extremely disapointed with the lazy filming recording and editing 
see this movie at lest once to see just how bad it is unlike it s predecessor heavy metal k has one single minute story arch talking place in the far future using both hand drawn animation and very bad cgi bad even for the basic plot is that a miner named tyler michael ironsides stumbles across a green glowing crystal that is a literal key to the fountain of youth the only draw back is that the moment he touches it tyler goes completely bonkers and starts killing a lot of people the key draws tyler to a settlement called eden full of people who haves traces of the life giving compound in them giving them a healthy good looking looks tyler probtly kills half of the population and kidnaps the rest a lone survivor of the raid julie julie strian begins a blind quest of revenge everything that could be bad in any given movie is bad in hmk the dialog is terrible both written and performed the camera work is terrible there s no back story to speak of tere are loop holes that even a baby can see not even a connection to the first firm with the loc nar which the key is suppose to be a shard from except that it s green also there are not special features on this dvd i don t mind the violence or the nudity in fact i want to see more of that in western animation but this movie is just as forgettable as any other movie that julie strian stars in 
sentimental and fake having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i can t fathom the entire plot is self serving shallow and unrealistic i guess it s supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i don t condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who don t get it and it doesn t mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the writer director gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you can t keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it s not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that wouldn t bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself 
great movie horrible dvd the move is one of my favorite sci fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to dvd that i have seen there are no special features and no chapter stops this is as if they copied a video tape to a dvd i could accecpt it being full frame but if i had known that it was this cheap a transfer i would not have purchased it 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
trite the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i don t know where to begin whatever you do don t buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
fading fading gone this movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books ethan hawke leans to heavily on kris kristofferson s performances not to mention jeff tweedy s music as a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music it is written interestingly enough but the visuals look like there wasn t enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on the best way to watch this movie is in the background you don t need the visuals and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away 
wow forgot how awful this film was what a disgusting stupid movie i saw this when i was just a kid and news flash drew barrymore doesnt look like that anymore not trying to be rude but what the hell is wrong with that girls chin it grew over the years because she looked fine in bad girls this movie and i think boys on the side but movies like never been kissed and at the end of charlie s angels full throttle all you can see when you look at her face is that huge white chin like a jay leno chin reminds me of the moon man from mcdonalds with the huge chin that sticks way out it s a cruel fact of what time does to our looks when you get older you arent as pretty as you use to be but i never thought chins grew bigger in her early years her chin was of normal size now it looks huge and deformed as for this movie not sexy at all unless you find a backstabbing murdering lying crazy ass teenage girl sexy maybe men would like it because all it has is sex scenes only for shallow people who get excited when it comes to that fantasy of a much older man having sex with a teenage girl and he s old enough to be her father i dont find it sexy at all it just wasn t believable in any way shape or form a complete waste of time money and talent flat out garbage thumbs down 
anno hideki at his most severe dont get me wrong this was a great movie between the mad low res camera and the disgusting sexual situations it suceeds in what it sets out to do disgust you for at least two hours after i watched it i felt literally sick to my stomach and even now i find it hard to to sleep as i think about it it was similar to the feelings i got from watching the end of evangelion however this was more powerfull and felt less like a glimpse into anno s mind and more like a plunge into darkness 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
ambrose bierce is a better authority i have rented this video for the sake of a trip down memory lane of course fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility i hated this video for its teaching of american ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable for example in 
dont buy it if you buy complete epic series gosh where can i start i buy it combine with complete epic series i found it no much diffrent ces also have this episode amazon should advice the customer clearly pertaining this matter before the customer buy it now i m facing difficult to sell it back to amazon due to the locality of my country malaysia and its very difficult to find fans of bsg old version in my country in order to sold it off so should there any bsg fans in my country who read this i m willing to sell it around rm very good condition i can be reach at 
disapointed i was verry disapointed to see this movie because i wanted to see the real movie and not a musical movie im still looking for the real real movie but still can t find it 
oy vey oh dear this movie was an abomination why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead i can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book s storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers but honestly there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal and the film design ! bleh ! maybe it would be appealing to yearold girls but to me it looked garish cheap and really fake the costuming was slightly better than our high school plays and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated i felt so much dumber after watching this movie i feel like i need an iq test or a good book speaking of good books ella enchanted is one of my favorites i don t know why i thought of that book just now i guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it but not much 
poor adaptation as said by other reviewers a lot of what was in the original story was changed and the film was updated to the time period where it was the boys are american from a military school and talk about fear of the russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams the choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals i don t want to sound like i m stereotyping people in the military but people in general already think there s a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal basically i think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost you don t feel like there s a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the film for example during the bonfire sequence jack is shouting out directions ok you be the pig we ll be the hunters and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire not actually hurting him mind you just chasing him that s not chaos nor barbarism that s an organized celebration it s about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation the director tries to play this scene out like it s a terrible thing but it just doesn t come across that way i might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation that being the john hurt that film if i recall correctly didn t have a single big brother is watching you likewise this film doesn t have a single kill the pig spill her blood that s right the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie actually a kid in one scene says quietly we killed a pig that s about it this leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal like behavior the fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal chanting and screaming kill the pig ! slit her throat ! spill her blood was one of the most poignant moments of the book and film and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to tell me about the rabbits george on a final note the character of piggy is ruined in this film danuel pipoly was terrible in the role and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play i don t wanna give too much away but i was happy when something something happened to him that sounds mean but it s true and it s a very bad thing in a film like this this film could have been good but it fails on all levels the transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable making the whole point of the story lost on the audience the best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end and he s in about ten seconds of film time i hate comparing it to the film version so much but i would really suggest people see that instead avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
boooriiiiiing i want the two hours of my life back after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in that time is past even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your s and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated ! 
it was so boring that i could scream this line spoken by julie christie to dirk bogarde in darling just about sums up my feelings towards this movie although i am halfway done with this movie i think this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen and i am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing i am done with this movie believe it or not and it only got worse christie s character diana scott marries an italian man who hello is old enough to be father ! and oh yes he s an aging prince in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to grace kelly and what would happen to jacqueline kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her princess diana almost made me laugh that nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my tv a la elvis presley considering that this is the same setup that occurs in georgy girl and that is spoiled british girl living in swinging england marries older man three words anna nicole smith also i would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that christie deserved the oscar for best actress she didn t at all because it should and i mean should of gone to julie andrews for the sound of music my pick for the best movie of the s because not only did she overtake her performance of mary poppins for which she won the oscar she pulverized every performance by a female that year including christie and there s a problem with the academy they can t seem to pull the trigger in giving back toback oscars to the same person im not alone in this arugment in danny perry s book alternate oscars he picks andrews for best actress of and states that the reason why the ampas gave the oscar to christie was not because it was the british invasion but they saw it as a way to give an oscar to christie s other film doctor zhivago which was t som s rival and added to the fact that zhivago had no acting nominations there s another oscar problem they don t know when to be hip also does it seem like dirk bogarde and lawrence harvey were the two worst actors in film history because it seems to me that every movie that i have seen with them are bad weather it was this movie or the manchurian candidate with harvey or modesty blaise with bogarde in conclusion i think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an oscar or as what bogarde said to christie a fitting way to close this review since that i end where it begins i don t take taxis that are filled with whores ! 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
the worst vampires movie is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects 
could ve been so good ok this obscure slasher seems promising good premise attractive and interesting cast with a few known names decent budget and effects a sense of humour and witty bitchy dialogue i mean you d think a horror flick about competing for cheerleader queen would be a can t miss no so where did cheerleader camp go astray in two major areas pacing and body count nothing ever really happens until the ending and after all the build up most of the murders occur offscreen ! so basically there s no payoff what a waste of a great set up an an eager game cast don t buy rent 
if all you want is yoga positions this video is for you i was disappointed in this video i was looking forward to doing a routine with my year old and trying to start her on self regulatory techniques the video merely did a well paced run through of various poses but gave no structure or routine to follow most disappointing 
the creators need to be shot yeah that is extreme but my goodness based on the original spy kids the kid in me was excited about another movie with d glasses whooooo ! well let me tell you i have seen some bad movies but this was worse than anything i have ever seen there was just nothing there i won t go into the plot because others have already done it i think that if you are years old and excited about watching a d film you may like this but anyone older will be wondering what is this crap that i am watching in order to give it a fair review i watched the whole thing and it was just terrible sylvester stallone must really be hard up for roles because i can t believe that he starred in such crap bottom line i think the creators placed too much of their focus on making a d movie clearly the plot and lines were an afterthought clearly i have to give this movie an f i will never watch it again and if i felt it would sell for more than a few pennies on ebay i would get rid of it i ll be putting this dvd in my dvd graveyard 
great acting but unbelievable story line this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting especially the girls playing christy and ariel is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but couldn t he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but can t find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i can t imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter s eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed 
the worst film of all time artie may well be a baby gorilla but the film sucks 
brannaugh blows it again bad although not a fan of kenneth brannaugh s i was willing to give his hamlet a fair viewing since this is my favorite play i was hoping the film would be better than his last two mediocre endeavors into shakespeare s plays unfortunately it s worse ! beginning with the performances jack lemmon is a wonderful actor but here he is an embarrassment as are many of the other actors assembled including julie christie whom i usually adore the casting is all over the map which makes for uneven performances and unsatisfying scenes brannaugh s own delivery of the text is rushed and usually unconvincing despite the vehemence with which he delivers every over ennunciated syllable which sounds manic bordering on farce bad direction and over indulgent acting ! it might be interesting to see what brannaugh would do with good direction instead of his own i could go on about my problems with the staging and other production values but the damage to this brilliant work is on every level and not worth going in to in depth the good news is that zefferelli s hamlet with another actor i don t normally like mel gibson is spot on perfect the actor s are excellently cast the production values and direction are serve the text rather than competing with it as in brannaugh s version zefferelli knows his shakespeare and his films in my opinion represent the definitive versions watch his romeo juliet and taming of the shrew too bad for us he didn t do more too bad also no one contemporary seems as capable instead we get the recent unwatchable junk with hipcool sensibilities argh its not surprising no one is in a rush to produce a dvd of this tragedy of a film 
wild orchid please more like withered orchid after two moon junction and weeks i expected a lot when i watched wild orchid last night unfortunately i was extremely disappointed i don t mean to imply the movie is totally awful or the worst movie ever made it s not but the movie had nothing unique about it at all and lacked a certain something the expression when you got it you got it holds true to movies and wild orchid didn t have it its not mickey rourke or carre otis fault their both attractive people who seemed to try hard with the material on hand but the material just wasn t interesting it lacked subtlety the worst part of the film is the horrid trite dialogue im afraid if i touch you you ll disappear if you want me come and hold me right now you ve got to be kidding me zalman king should learn to quit while he s ahead take a look at the red shoe diaries for example the same story recycled multiple times shamelessly using david duchovney to draw viewers because it wouldn t attract a single one without him or at least none out of high school and not desperately looking for some late night nudity this film is the same it uses weeks and mickey rourke to draw viewers even though it can t stand on its own feet because it s so unoriginal and poorly written never mind the acting what was bruce greenwood thinking wild orchid held neither the fascinating complexities and characters of weeks or the dreamlike imagery and compelling mystery of two moon junction it was just sex it held none of the sensuality of the above mentioned it s too bad because there was a lot of potential there it was very much a letdown in this case what you see is ultimately exactly what you ll get just don t expect anything more then that again i wish this movie had been made differently the main word that comes to mind when viewing wild orchid is typical 
broadway s lost treasures i can t write a review because i had to send both cd s back because they would not play i just ordered another one yesterday and here s hoping that will be okay

the mothman travesty three problems with this film pacing the film s pacing doesn t vary it s very boring as a matter of fact this wouldn t be a problem if the film were much more tense eg speed however this film lacks the high action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed effects too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions and there is an overabundance of high speed imaging the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling horror scenes furthermore they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film s plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole the upshot the film relies too heavily on the art of editing to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting triviality the plot s conclusion quails in the face of the so what question the viewer is left with a sense of i sat through the film for that in light of points and this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake dont waste your life alon 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
my friend i saw this in the s and i can remember some of the scenes to this day im now i was my friend at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i didn tfor a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what s considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horrorandbrutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
big name cast adds up to unfocussed dud the worst movie of this genre incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad ! this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much as can be said for keifer sutherland and others that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies 
the book is better i watched this on masterpiece theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book the characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you don t have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny droning music 
well photographed beautiful locations but ultimately unsatisfying the acting is extremely average the plot is very underplayed in fact too underplayed even the erotic aspect of the movie loses its charm early on i dunno i don t think anais nin would ve approved of this adoption of her work 
dissapointing this dvd is a complete rip off the performance is more focussed on bonos sunglasses with a camera in his sun glasses of all things keep it simple and exciting that means proper editing its oviuous this editor should nt be editing any shows what so ever and needs lessons as to how to tell a story to an audience we are not at the show so stop trying to create an atmosphere of swishing shots because the atmosphere for the viewers is the flaming living room and your job is to bring something into the room not try and pull you in with disasterous effects what a great big switch of off on the remote and a dollar cash in at the second hand store thnak you very much for nothing 
note the running time minutes make sure you pay more attention to the running time than i did i paid for minutes of a cartoon ! the word episode implies at least minutes of showtime i am disappointed that they did not combine several episodes to make this a more realistic purchase the quality was good however and it downloaded right away to my tivo 
well i love you you potato head you d think with a cast including cary grant ginger rogers marilyn monroe and a chimpanzee all directed by the great howard hawks you d have a side splitter and a half but you d be wrong cause this snoozer barely even squeezed a chuckle out of me cary grant is a scientist working on a youth formula funny premise but it takes over minutes before the chimpanzee mixes up some real youth formula and grant accidentally takes it the results are humorous but the effects wear off too soon then ginger rogers drinks some and her take on the youth trip is just lame and even depressing finally at the end they both take it with unfunny results this movie was a great disappointment to me change the script replace grant with fred macmurray and replace rogers with either vera miles or katharine hepburn and you d have something 
don t waste your money the best scene in the movie the i love the nightlife disco scene has been edited and the music replaced with some lame tripe it is painful to watch they are completely out of step with the music and the song is really awful imagine the godfather with the restaurant scene where michael gets the guys who hit his dad edited out ! it ruins the entire movie wait for it on cable and tape or tivo it ! 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
far from eisenstein s finest hour alexander nevsky may be an eisenstein film but that doesn t make it any less cheesy in fact it makes some of those italian peplum look substantial by comparison with it s crude stereotyping and propaganda as the russian people rise to save their homeland in defiance of the capitalist and aristocratic oppressors of the people and do battle with the baby burning papist germans how stalin ever signed the ribbentrop molotov pact after this hatchet job is a mystery much of the filming is as clumsy as the characterization with obvious painted backdrops clumsy medieval speak dialog constant reversion to silent moviemaking techniques at their least compelling and a tendency to go for height in the image to such an extent that the action is often barely clinging to the bottom of the frame it s reputation rests on prokofiev s dreary score and the spectacular battle on the ice although both are a mixture of the good the bad and the downright lazy only moments in the aftermath of the battle retain any real potency 
we all hated this film i bought this dvd because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen we re still friends but i ll never listen to one of his reviews again our taste must not be compatible my wife daughter and i seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we ve ever seen it s the only movie i ve ever turned off before the end on the plus side watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema i used to think i knew bad movies now i know that most movies are at least pretty good and it s only a very few that are truly bad this is one of those very few bad films best in show belongs to a genre of comedies that i find boring at best but often cruel and mean other films of this type are waiting for guffman bottle rocket etc if you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you ll appreciate this movie 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
attack of the mutant flies the script outrageously lifts the opening set up from quot the big chill quot until the swarm of mutant flies shows up and attacks the cast thats right mutant flies ! the problem is that flies are not scary at all they do not have the shriek factor of spiders scorpions or roaches the terrible cgi effects do not help there are a couple of effective suspense moments but most of the action takes place in daylight which deminishes the scare factor 
lack of talent ruins a movie that could have been good battlefield earth is an adaptation of the book by l ron hubbard while the book was a rather interesting story about humans led by jonnie goodboy tyler taking back earth from the psychlos the film has turned the story into a string of badly filmed action sequences with silly camera angles and awful editing the psychlos already have human workers before capturing jonnie this change in the story serves no purpose but makes the story even more messy the film then focuses on some of the story elements in the book but leaves most of it out including the entire last half considering this was a dream project for john travolta it s strange that he would let the book be made into such a bad movie especially such a silly one while the book was not without flaws it was actually pretty good but the movie is for the most part more or less incompetently made the director writers and editors all did a bad job it does have some entertainment value though which keeps me from giving it the lowest rating 
don t even bother okay i was excited to see this movie i read a few non fiction books on the dot com bust and thought i knew a thing or two but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from i mean who cares about these people s relationships not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail this movie sucked 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
a poor man s dick i m sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i m sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst or that level of indefatigable cuteness just go rent dick instead you ll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country 
very sad attempt at a sequel i rented this film immediatley after seeing the first bride with white hair hoping for a fluid and entrancing continuation of the story there was a perfect setup for a sequel and i couldn t wait to watch it unfold after the first half an hour i knew that director ronnie yu had abandoned the feel of the first film and it seemed he didn t really give a damn about how interesting the story was poor dialogue inadequate story there was nothing satisfying or even interesting in this film if you enjoyed the first bwwh you ll probably still be tempted to watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying 
oh dear oh dear when a reveiw starts with oh dear then you just know the movie went bad i waited and hoped this film would be released i d heard so much about it this was one of the most horrific movies banned under the video nasty craze i think it was banned because it was plain rubbish do not buy its pretty bad but if your like me your gonna buy it anyway get some beer and watch it if you have to 
i disagree with j mccormack it is horrible the movie is frustrating and a big disappointment and what is the point of everything being so white is there some deep meaning here or something this movie is exasperating 
so terribly bad people desperately wanted to see olivia and john reunite after the success of grease the dismal grease sequel came out with no sign of them so someone had the idea of re teaming them for something completely different two of a kind is a silly plot about two people who are destined to meet thanks to the good lord above and through some silly scenarios we are supposed to believe they will the acting is absolutely shocking not just from olivia perhaps the only saving grace is the average single twist of fate this is not a cult classic make no mistake it is easily one of those hall of shame films i cannot believe that there are reviewers out there who like this joke of a film 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
where s the passion recently i read about the revival of a chorus line on broadway i ve never seen the broadway show or any other staging of it so i thought the movie might give me a sneak peek well somewhat disappointed here i can only assume that the stage version with its long running reputation must be better than this film it s not that the film is a total debacle but it s only mildly pleasant and quickly forgettable even songs which i had heard before like what i did for love were reduced to barely a mention in the film the film seemed to lack any real point a bit of a yawner 
fantasy not to be confused with facts this telplay is supposedly based on the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth that possibility is real and many people take the issue seriously one commercial film deep impact also included some real effort to get it right however there is nothing in this film that relates to the real concern about asteroid impacts this is pure fantasy and thus a turn off to anyone who has thought seriously about this issue 
not remotely as good as the book i might have enjoyed this movie more if they hadn t gutted the book which was a pretty good read the best character in the book fbi special agent pendergast isn t even in the movie and new york city police lt d agosta is just a comic caricature of the book s character another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything if the purpose was to create a moody scary atmosphere they went way too far see if you must but don t expect too much 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
amazon com likes to take my money this is another story that i don t know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails doesn t seem to work if they didn t have the best prices for movies i d leave 
it is hard to get much lamer than the stan tookie williams story this movie is the big lie logic attempting to prove itself again most despotic criminals use a big lie concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which stan tookie williams is cut this dvd is nothing more than a big lie ! that ranks right up there with nazi big lie era triumph of the will like any monster tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart this dvd should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how big lies told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls even if stan tookie williams is just responsible for helping create the crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book that he writes a few lame anti gang kiddie books and played his con game to perfection on minutes convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is redeemed is of no consequence whatsoever tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de fang this monster of the first order tookie williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer s reality in the end tookie williams got what he deserved a needle ride to hell s gate if there is any enternal justice buy this redemption the stan tookie williams story dvd if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work i look at stan tookie william s and all i see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his caged creep conversion but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way when i saw this dvd on stan tookie williams he reminded me of ernst rohm german army officer and nazi official who founded the sa brown shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit this is a good dvd because jamie foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic self absorbed social parasite in redemption the stan tookie williams story if tookie gets a nobel prize i think he should be forced to share it with ernst rohm german army officer and nazi official who founded the sa brown shirts as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction child killing weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit

jason takes your money as a general rule any film with a large number of roman numerals behind it is going to suck and the eighth outing of the f franchise jason takes manhattan obeys this rule to a fanatical degree this movie is terrible an utter embarrassment and is noteworthy only as a study in corporate greed and marketing deception by the fourth installment of the series the ironically titled final chapter this formulaic slasher franchise was as exhausted as an old blood soaked boot jason voorhees had outlived his usefulness and it was time for his rotted a s to hang up the gaolie mask and retire but the movie industry is an industry first and when the final chapter turned unexpectedly into a cash cow the studio execs at paramount continued to flog their exhausted serial killer into progidies of meaningless violence the final chapter was followed by three more absolutely asinine sequels which saw jason improve the crystal lake gene pool by slaughtering legions of pot smoking teenage dimwits by this time p mount was beginning to get embarrassed by their deformed kill crazy stepchild yet the lure of an easy payday drew them on i still remember seeing the preview for this flick in a movie theater back in the audience ate it up we actually believed that the producers had decided to tweak the exhausted series by loosing jason in a place where he would probably feel right at home the big apple one could only imagine the bloody shennanigans crystal lake s least popular citizen could embark upon in new yawk city ! people were laughing out loud as they imagined him loose in the city of lights he could slay obnoxious volcanoites ! teach rude cab drivers the errors of their ways ! annihilate the snotty salespeople at tiffanys ! cut down on panhandlers ! convince grafitti artists to stay out of dark alleys ! run for mayor ! we sixteen year olds loved the idea there was just one problem the gang at paramount had no intention of delivering on their promise the ad campaign like the title of the movie was a fraud and the only thing that got taken in this film was the money of a lot of bloodthirsty teenage dupes first of all the first minutes of this odd minute movie are not set in manhattan but in crystal lake and then on a ship called the lazarus get it which is conveying the usual cargo of teenage acting skool dropout slasher fodder on a graduation cruise to new york jason accidentally revived from the depths of the lake by a jolt of electricity stows on board the ship and proceeds to ch chch ha haha his way through the doltish grads and the suspiciously small crew until the survivors are pursuaded to take a rowboat to manhattan island unfortunately manhattan island with the exception of a couple of second unit establishing shots is largely an unimaginative looking soundstage on the paramount lot populated by central casting new yawkers including the usual mixed race mugger team and an irish cop who says things like well ye seem loike foine peeple so i ll not be arresting ye there is not a single scary moment in the whole film and there are not even any particularly interesting kills kane hodder s plodding rotting thoroughly over rated jason looks almost bored as if he signed onto the cruise by accident and then got talked into doing his mass murder shtick by the ship s entertainment director to make up for the lack of any kind of suspense the writers threw in a lot of gratuitous pleading for mercy from the female characters and added nice little moments like a ship s crewmember talking warmly about his baby son right before jason runs a harpoon through his body classy stuff but really everything about the movie is stupid from the crazy deckhand who mumbles prophetically that the voyage is doomed shades of crazy ralph to the annoyingly cute little dog who has more acting talent than most of the victims hell the climax of the film features a chase through the new york sewers which we are told flood with radioactive toxic waste every midnight does rudy guilani know about this i realize having expectations for a jason movie is silly but even by the cellar low standards of the franchise this flick is a ripoff a fraud a dreadful fake utterly stupid appallingly bad useless terrible and horrible zero stars 
for die hard kutcher fans only the movie starts off very slowly with childhood episodes from ashton kutcher s character it s at least an hour before we see the adult kutcher although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene the premise is good and it has some good momentum in the middle which is why i gave it two stars the shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done but the overall story line is very weak and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story also the movie has too many tongue incheek references to kutcher s real life circumstances such as the reference to tightywhities they distract from the story and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle which is too bad if you are not a kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie skip this one 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
firefly excellent but buy it on dvd not unbox read the unbox terms of use carefully before choosing this route over a regular dvd purchase it is not your usual set of blah blah legal jargon for example c removal of software if you uninstall or otherwise remove the software your ability to view all digital content you have downloaded to the authorized device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all digital content from that authorized device without notice to you if you ever remove the unbox software amazon may revoke your ability to view the firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine amazon i ve ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience why did you let unbox create these anti customer terms of use 
baseball lovers only if you don t enjoy baseball at all then you won t enjoy this movie 
two stars for the score only bernard hermman s score is magnificent this was a major let down for me considering it was directed by truffaut lacked any real suspense and edge boring camera work for the most part some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster the acting was fine i guess it was just a pointless story i felt that really didn t go anywhere and what was with that crummy ending 
strange movie very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it 
what a bad movie i wouldn t recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone due to a high content of bad words screaming and violence it s kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else some people really enjoyed it and that s not me and that s not the other two people i know who watched it some violent parts are a bit hard to believe but i guess that s what the story is about this movie is a bit of a hollywood style suspense with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies theres one good idea in this movie and that s how life develops as it goes along and one action or inaction changes how life plays out but this is no where near original even the simpsons had an episode like that so this movie is definitely not on my best movies list 
speeding to hell the story here dosen t matter the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction meth quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless roberts is so gay you want to smack his face he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius a role he plays better than anyone today in film br

stupid softcore dvd don t buy this disc unless you are a real jackie lovell fan the best thing in this dvd is lovell s dance at the end 
great movie horrible dvd buena vista the company that releases disney films on dvd chose to not release anamorphic dvds when they first came to dvd so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced this means if you have a widescreen television you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture also these discs are absolutely barebones only featuring a dolby soundtrack and a widescreen presentation where are the extras i don t know about you guys but i am a mighty duck fan who is disappointed by the dvd release of this film 
yuck the description of this movie is very interesting dont fall for it the actions described happen dont get me wrong but in a plodding and talentless way the subtitles move very fast and interferes with your ability to actually see the movie acting very sub par and story not distinctive enough to make it worth recommending to a friend or watching again

not much plot poor editing avoid avoid this one the bad reviews are not kidding the plot is almost non existent the action scenes are not enough to make up for the poor editing the writing has drawn the characters very thinly sadly a reason to watch this movie is to be amused at how badly it is put together 
robin hood it s not i spent most of the time in fast forward and don t think that i missed any of the plot i gave it a because it was not so bad that i turned it off a good movie to put on in the backround if you are not going to pay it much attention 
bad first the original magic flute is in german this version is not ! second the audio is not dolby digital not even prologic bad qualitythird bad image quality i do not reccomend this version of magic flute i do not frequently review items i have bought but i decided to review this one because everytime my kids ask me to watch this dvd i remember what bad choice i ve made 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha

star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
dissenting view on pippi even as a kid i remember getting bored with pippi quickly unless i m not recalling correctly each chapter stands alone so there s no real plot as such the other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant irreverant spunky girl hero yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female to the extent that they don t even have personalities theyre just cardboard cutouts foils for the main character not only is annika fearful hesitant afraid of risking adult disapproval and not wanting to get her dress dirty but she s not in the least influenced by pippi to be more adventurous lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn t accomplish much unlike caddie woodlawn this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls 
yikes and eww i have friends who might be into this stuff if only because they like the old and the strange me i m just like is this its a wonderful life i think i might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if i picked up the script as it is this just barely seems to translate into a movie and forgive me for i have my own opinion city of angels was a good movie too bad if you don t like all this contemporary nonsense i feel like it worked my opinion it s long it s boring it s hard to hear even if it has a message i just can t relate to it so maybe that s my problem your opinion your own keep it you re lucky i gave it two stars 
highly offensive i couldn t stomach this movie for long i kept waiting hoping for some redeeming quality to emerge but the language nudity and explicit sexual content was too much for me so i turned it off and never saw the entire film if there was any poignant brilliant story with any depth it was buried in filth and raunch i would not recommend film this to anyone nicholas cage or not it was disgusting 
the constant gardener i m starting to appreciate john lecarre novels more than i did when he was all over the bestseller list this film version of one was acted well but in minutes there just wasn t anything to engage my interest not its characters and not its plot a good cause worth building a story around but not this story i quit watching so i guess i could be wrong but i doubt it 
if i could give it a negative i would this movie was just about the worst movie i ever saw so utterly and painfully pointless and not the slightest bit funny tom green makes a complete fool of himeself i actually turned off the movie half way through because it was so stupid don t waste your time or money on this one ! 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd

missing nite life sucks i wish i had read further in the reviews if i had known that the song i love the nite life had been replaced i would never have bought the film it is very limp without this shame shame shame ! this should be mentioned so that folks can make a more informed decision instead of wasting money 
an empty sci fi thriller this is one of those movies where you re just waiting for something to happen but never does it just meanders along and relies on its special fx which are quite good to give the movie any substance at all a couple of good performances by the cast without being outstanding but there was only so much they could do with a shallow script they look lost and wanting to give more but are restricted there are better a lot better sci fi movies out there than this one special features aren t very interesting either 
why bother i find myself rehashing my own reviews at this point but nonetheless i aspire to write a review on each instalment producers have tested logistics to new levels by taking jason on a murderous vacation to new york the film begins on camp crystal where two teenage lovers are discussing the legend of jason whilst they speak of him jason is electrocuted again back to life by the contact of the boat s anchor more conveniently he finds a hockey mask on the boat to cover up his unsightly face cue two dead teens with very bad gory effects and jason s off on his way to new york cue once again a series of brutal murders on the boat with female heroine jensen dagett avoiding him at all costs until he reaches new york shores as a side story the heroine has had previous contact with jason when she is swimming in the water so she is frightened of the water as a result at this stage a change of scenery was needed but it doesn t work well at all what s so scary in new york comedy is used to no effect in this movie and again the death scenes are more elaborate can this unlucky lady stop jason in his tracks one more time will this beast ever die i rest my case 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
i was fooled by the dvd art ok though i can t find the actual version of this dvd on amazon com that i own i m going to warn you anyway so i am at the local pawn shop and i see a dvd titled graveyard tramps and it s all colored with black and purple hot topic style fonts and a very attractive goth girl on the front standing in a graveyard now don t get me wrong i knew i wasn t picking up a piece of cinematic gold but i did not get what i expected i expected a modern cheezy low budget film about maybe zombies or just psycho girls in a graveyard goth girls in a graveyard as the cover art depicted i knew it would be low budget i knew it would be but oh well i have an addiction for sexy young goth women so i get home put the dvd in and to my dissapointment i have a s cheese fest about naked better homes and garden type housewives sexing men to death i have yet to watch it past the first ten minutes and that was pretty liquored up so i can t judge if this movie is good or not maybe i ll get comatose and make it through the whole thing i can say the visuals remind me of the original stepford wives sooooo don t be fooled by stock photos and creepy goth cover art i guess that s the moral of this story ! 
if there s a worse movie than this i haven t seen it if there s a worse movie than this i haven t seen it ! looks like it was made in a day the quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits sort of like it was copied from a vhs tape that was recorded in the hour mode after it was played times the actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad twilight zone episode if you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes the musical performances are obscure little known doo wop flops ! except for frankie lymon look i wasted plus tax plus gas to run out and buy this bomb the only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in swedish send it to a greenwich village art house and pass it off as a foreign film come to think of it dont bother to dub it the sound is so off it looks dubbed already ! important update please read this ! i later discovered after i wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the s i understand that it is used constantly at the international institute for sleep disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi comcious near sleep state for incurable insomniacs and so as i write this update i ve been watching the flick again and i must admit iyawn oh excuse me where was i oh yes i must admit that i bigger yawn oh my goodness im so sorry this is so rude of me yawn but it seems like snoringisnoring i just can t seem to intense snoring 
a lot of green light and not much else rule number one if you re making a stephen king movie especially if it s a tv movie make it scary or don t make it at all ! the tommyknockers fails to do this miserably ! for most of the film you re watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions granted that s all in the book but it written chillingly by king in a way only he can do it there are some exciting alien moments at the end but by then it s too late you ve just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an x files episode on the plus side i had no problem watching the infamous traci lords act like like a total slut ! bless her 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
zero stars for the worst western ever made this has to be a joke ! how could ve stars like brando and nicholson agreed to appear in such rubbish is beyond comprehension ! brando with the worst irish accent you ll ever hear and nicholson trying to play the clarinet ! do the fans a huge favour and delete this horrible movie 
extreme something some folks need only a paper thin plot to string together a bunch of action sequences without character or theme or language or logic getting in the way if that s you this may be your movie xtreme sports xtreme ops get it if that doesn t strike you as xtremely clever you may find this movie painful to watch i m thinking of telling the agony booth about it the humor doesn t work to the extent that i think i want a laugh track after all or a drummer doing rim shots ba dumbum characters are distinguishable by such things as fake national accent and stereotyped mannerisms hair style and or color or shouting all his dialogue i didn t watch it all i didn t even watch enough to tell you what it s about amazon or imdb can tell you what it s about just something else we found in the flat someone s losing credibility as a selector of dvds 
not bad once when i watched this movie i have to say i thought it was pretty pointless napolean dynamite is too but it s funny this isn t quite up to dynamite standards i m afraid it s not as squeaky clean as good ol napolean either don t buy it if you must see it rent it 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
hasn t this been done much better before let s be frank shall we this mock sci fi is just one more take on cant we all just get along how transparent dress up the black guy in a silly rubber suit and pretend he s an alien involve him in sports ! there aren t many films that make me curse out loud but this is one of them treacly and brain dead beyond endurance the only thing that might have saved it would have been a spirited rendition by poor gossett of it isn t easy being green one of the other reviewers mentioned lee marvin and toshiro mifune in hell in the pacific i couldn t agree more that film essentially the same thing is immeasurably better do yourself a favor skip this exploitive garbage and watch either hell in the pacific or some genuine science fiction 
pretty bad movie brokedown palace is bad how bad is it it s pretty bad man dont tell me i didn t warn you 
snore don t let the cover fool you this film isn t half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it s my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove or at least something interesting to watch and it s not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy division new order happy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost came off as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i wouldn t call this bad it had it s good parts just not many

poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet

beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
not worth i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for bucks and i am so glad that i did that said the first series is worth watching for two main reasons overt lesbianism and jinnai the former is self explanatory while the latter jinnai is without a doubt the best character in the series despite the fact that he is the antagonist you can t say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed out character as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story s main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging and this is what makes the second series all four dismal episodes so tragic they nerfed jinnai he could never have been called a genius in the first series but he was decidedly intelligent cool pragmatic supremely self confident and an effective leader even though he was also manic and delusional in el hazard ii as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain they have turned jinnai into a slapstick idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon i suggest purchasing el hazard through alternate means watching the first series and discarding the second let s face it even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
not as bad as i expected but not great either warning movie spoiler below i confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film is grounded in recent history i was around in the early s when l ron hubbard and his scientologists were going full bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like chuck norris or so i thought when all of a sudden hubbard died and the whole project apparently fell apart back then i was close to years old and i was curious about whatever it was that these scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person s quality of life then i read about larry wollersheim s lawsuit you can figure the rest out for yourself anyhow oh yeah the movie the storyline is your basic alien invasion number i e the invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans in this film the aliens look a lot like the klingons from star trek until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the invaders to get off of our planet pretty simple and straightforward but hey there are other films much worse than battlefield earth and they ve taught me that if you have good enough special effects even the lamest sci fi storylines can work the thing that stood out about this film though was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue and as a result it came across as rather corny a film to be recommended for its comedy value rather than for things like epic space battle scenes also the bad guy aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects in order to keep them from organizing revolts i must say trying to depict mind manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a cd it turns it into a confusing incomprehensible mess ! a couple of times the picture would break up into a concentric blur and i d wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on how the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like warner to help them film it is something which will forever remain a mystery to me i remember just before this picture opened a group of scientologists were trying to hype it oh watch this film is going to be bigger than star wars and gone with the wind combined you can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized can you say oops 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
warning do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish there is factual information here but it is buried in gushy self absorption i bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause but i d be embarrassed to lend it out 
marco i ll always watch gary cooper but as marco polo he s just not that good mgm lavish production seems kind of chinzy amusing entertaining not so much he hops effortlessly from venice to china he messes around with another man s fiancee in the th century as th century american men were wont to do nobody knows what marco polo was really like he brought the west spaghetti gunpowder the rest of the story seems like it s from the screenwriters at mgm the movie ends with marco taking princess kukachin sigid gurie to her husband in persia the long way around the more time to fool around until she marries nice 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
post war propaganda this film was probably made not to entertain the audience but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on bosnia but it does so for a small part only showing the bosniaks and serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion with the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists its attempt to blind the viewer hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality but also through poor cinematografic form the dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss the handling shows several onlogical moments and as a concept of quotwe all suffered and we serbs did not start the war quot it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing this movie does not entertain at all and shows the events as unrealistic as any b movie about vietnamwar and about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in serbia my rating is absolutely thumb down comparing with for example no man s land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former yugoslavia instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war you can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie 
ugh what drivel i m a big mann fan and i even enjoy his not very good non noir or western films thunder bay for instance a great director but this one stinks i can t even get up the enthusiasm to criticise i 
just another boring s movie first off the name of the movie and the cover art are completely misleading this has nothing to do with any sort of graveyard and if they wanted to give you an idea of what you ll see inside they would have put a grainy washed out picture of a typical s housewife on the cover this is a really boring s detective drama about a rash of deaths in a small town some fbi guy is called in to investigate as it turns out there are some women who via some genetic cross breeding that gets only the vaguest of explanations are now running around having sex with men until they die the fbi guy figures this out by making a gigantic leap in logic at the very end there are some sci fi elements but that s about it oh yeah there s also a lot of topless women in it just about every female in the movie gets topless that s about the only good thing this movie has going for it the picture quality is horrible it looks like it was made from an old worn out video tape it also looks like whoever filmed it didn t know how to use a camera as many of the outdoor scenes are completely washed out the naked girl on the motorcycle looks like a white blob and many of the indoor scenes are extremely dark the sound advertised as dolby is simply mono overall don t waste your time it s not fun or cheesy it s just a crummy s flick that is rather boring and the dvd transfer is terrible 
confusing too many characters difficult to follow story line simply put the movie is boring clich upon clich is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son s death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie save your money save your time choose another movie 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
boring after reading so many rave reviews i decided to buy this video i owe many many workout videos and this is the most boring by far i have never been able to complete it very dissapointing ! 
this is uncut your kidding me this sure sounded like a hot movie when i read the overview a young woman curious about sex and trying to get herself off boy i sure was surprised at what this really is a super softcore b movie with terrible acting and almost no sex you want nudity sorry but this movie does have worms thats right worms ! in one of the sex scenes a guy puts live worms into the womans private area yeah its that bad stay far away from this one

trite the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i don t know where to begin whatever you do don t buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something 
kill meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee kill meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this movie is the worst movie of all all all time since the history of the universe and before that ! in theaters i was the only one watching that movie and i felt like walking out i wanted to cry the actors stink along with the plot and d effects all i can say is boooooooooo this movie sucks 
case study of county politics this film tells a story about lasalle parish in louisiana and by extension the rest of america sheriff darryl is shown handling the rigors of his job oddly he carries no pistol a symbol of lacking something a truck overturns on a curve and spills its load of shoes the poor people show up to carry off their free shoes recalling that scene in charles dickens tale of two cities then a dead body is found and this scandal should be censored says the political boss and judge sheriff darryl is visited by an exotic dancer who reports her husband is missing after dancing at a private club the rest of the film tells how the murder was solved the language and contents of this film would have been banned prior to the s while realistic about the lost souls it portrays it seems to have no redeeming social values yes it gives a view to politics and personalities not usually seen in films and which can educate the viewers the film does not mention the corporations like big oil that dominated the politics of louisiana and other states we see how the twin party system meets at the top to accomplish its missions like in a small county the heads of the opposing parties meet to divide the spoils in this film the governor loses an election was he too clean so a new administration takes office and life goes on unchanged there are some winners and loser but that s the way the ball bounces blaming a small businessman who has a claim against the county seems too cynical 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
van damnes worst im a big fan of van damne but when i saw this movie i was really disapointed the setting is dull the story is dull and the guy he fights dull i love van damnes other movie but this is the only one that sux 
give your fast forward a work out let s just be honest this film is terrible and not in the way that attack of the killer tomatoes is so terrible that it s great more like the way caddyshack ii is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame i was a kid when this film was released and while it was not particularly exciting then it is insanely tedious now it is a genuine test of patience but with no pay off what soeverheres some potentially helpful information the slasher film can branch in two directions supernatural friday the th ii halloween nightmare on elm street etc and crime revenge i spit on your grave friday the th tcm scream urban legend ect this one falls under the latter heading and while realism can render a more potent effect this could really happen ! this film simply fails to engage the viewer on any level the goal of a slasher film is two fold to horrify and repulse this does neither the horror element is non existent there is no point in expounding since there is nothing to examine and if you love gore and who doesn t try another film the murders are barely visible literally and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn many of the film s problems are technical the cinematography is just horrendous the entirely film is extremely underlit the colors are needlessly washed out and the film stock is grade f and this as you know is not because the film is over twenty five years old the problem was always there there is one good moment in the entire film when the school s bad boy has his head lopped off and it clumsily thunks down the prom court walk way still it is more comic relief than genuine horror the soundtrack could not be worse i am not referring to the disco tunes we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period but the tracks made for the film they sound like they were squeaked out by the carpenters so imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster psuedo thoughtful ballads like the final song on the track words cannot explain how wildly offensive it is ! did i mention that leslie nielson has a meaty role yes that leslie nielsen from airplane and naked gun he plays a tough minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter i know it sounds funny but it s not trust me ! if you dig watching unattractive teenagers disco the night away hey this film is totally for you but if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle period of its reign look elsewhere like halloween friday the th etc id be willing to get all ed mcmahon s star search on you and give this film a star but it is an important milestone in the slasher sub genre i will not spoil the film and tell you why though so if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar watch it on picture inpicture maybe after a few drinks on a day when the cable is out on fast forward 
over acting for beginners more bad acting and false passion than any human can stand if you can empathise with any of these characters see a doctor 
kevin coughlan is spot on i d write a review for this sewage but kevin did it so perfectly that i d be wasting my time the only decent one of these bunch of horrible adaptations was silent hill and even that one lacked the greatness of the video game and now there s a spyhunter movie coming out wtf is next prince of persia please don t do that one i was only kidding ! get the video games for the real thing 
poorly written script sends this one into the tank private investigator and former police detective jack ramsey michael harris is enjoying an affair with the local district attorney s wife but when she is strangled not long after he has departed following a session of amorous activity ramsey is pegged as the primary suspect due to clues obviously planted at the murder scene in order to incriminate him and additionally because of a zealous detective matt mccoy who has personal persons for disliking the former policeman as ramsey tries to clear his name the sister carrieanne moss of the deceased shows up and soon she and jack begin their own affair that is complicated by subsequent homicides and by jack s former police partner performed by brion james ostensibly despite private devils the sole individual ramsey can trust as additional evidence mounts against him despite entry of other suspects harris a charismatic player who has created excellent roles can do but little with a script that defeats as well the rest of the cast hindered by a wandering plot that is clichd and predictable from the film s opening while despite helpful cutting there remains an obligatory slow motion love scene as well as embarrassing emoting from mccoy moss and james that is made unduly prominent because of faltering direction 
snoozalinga i watched this dogg o with some japanese folks i know and let me tell ya all of thought it was the most boring obvious dated bore we d laid eyes on in many a moon and these guys are from a very wealthy aristocratic old japanese family at the vanguard of westernization in the s stay awa 
i was nt that impressed the story line was fair but the t a not so hot star 
friday the th part v a new beginning friday the th part v a new beginning is the worst in the series so far and that is saying allot the acting is much worst then in prior movies the script is awfull like on a police academy parts and onwards level and that is nothing short of terrible the special effects looked cheap even for the time the movie was made and the budget is like nothing close to the first couple of movie the music is outrageously bad and is probably some of the worst s music i have ever heard i love the s hairdoes the tacky cheap looking clothes and the make up is atrocious the dialogue is so bad that one wonders if it is a highschool project gone awry the killing scenes are also kind of lame and they seem to have run out of ideas the movie is only minutes long but it sure feels it is like at least twice as long and the plot makes no sense at all this is a movie that has no redeeming qualities and should be avoided at all costs

to much bark not enough bite i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it i heard that it was the most violent film ever made i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better i was dead wrong cannibal ferox is a boring unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in countrys the few gore scenes are pretty effective but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws if it was for giovanni lombardo radice one of my favorite italian horror actors starring in it cannibal ferox would only earn star 
awful dolph lundgren stars as a mercenary sent to kill a tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation dull and just plain pointless and stupid action film suffers from inept action scenes and logic lapses lundgren is imposing but can t act 
stupid just another one of those low budget stupid stoner movies my buddy let me have it for a day and i was pretty bored watching it there were a few funny scenes but for the most part a very crummy movie nothign nothing like cheech and chong don t waste your money 
was i supposed to laugh in this i seriously did not laugh once in this movie horatio sanz got me to crack a smile a couple times but i can t believe i think he should have been in the movie more i thought saturday night live was bad i had no idea ! snl is gold compared to this every single joke falls flat and the director obviously has no clue how to make a movie i can t even tell if jerry o connel and jake busey are bad actors because the director doesn t even give them a chance i think one thing that could have really helped this movie out would have been a script in case the director reads this review i want to tell him you need to have a script before shooting a film just a tip one of the worst movies i have ever seen easily

if you find another source if you find another source for this movie pursue it i liked the movie very much and saw it first produced on showtime entertainment this copy appears to be burn made from someone s tv set good movie for cheesy fun films poor quality recording 
is it ok for child actors to portray sex scenes like so many others this movie struck a raw nerve with me regarding the graphic detail that was enacted by then year old jena malone although the movie has a point to make about child abuse and sexual abuse i as the mother of a year old can not understand how another mother could stand by and watch her child being filmed in such graphic detail i could not watch the whole movie as the car scene was so disturbing i turned it off what is the difference between a child being molested and a child actor who is sitting in the lap of a grown man why are the laws different for jena yes these types of movies have a point to make but sacrificing the innocence of another child is not the way to do it

imho dumb movie after seeing some of the other amazon reviews of this movie and the fact that jason swartzman was in it after having seen him for the first time in rushmore a wonderful film i had to purchase a copy of this dvd for myself to view it s got a wonderful cast of fine actors but i found this movie really dumb one critic on the dvd box claimed this was laugh out loud funny really what movie was he watching i strained a chuckle here and there but that was about it for me the lily tomlin dustin hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script i know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie but i didn t find much to snicker about

so so i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it s cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in it ain t that much better on a whole 
vincent d onofrio saved this movie from getting star i found claire dolan to be a bleak sad and depressing portrayal of a woman trying to earn money to may off a debt by selling herself to wealthy business men not only did katrin cartlidge claire dolan not have any depth to her role but i found her terribly unappealing she only had one facial expression through out the entire movie even when she was having sex she showed no feeling or emotion granted some of the dullness to her character was due to her role but it seemed as though there was nothing underneath vincent d onofrio was the saving grace of this film playing claire s love and pseudo savior he carried the entire cast along with the very talented colm meaney this movie is an ok choice for any fan of mr d onofrios but other than that i found the film to be very boring and slow moving 
just when you think dolph can t get sink any lower i will be honest i like dolph lundgren a look at his filmography you see b movie classics such as the punisher universal soldier and blackjack dolph has been going trough a slump storm catcher and the startlingly routine jill the ripper and the awful minion aka fallen knight but with agent red dolph lundgren hits rock bottom agent red first of all steals it s music from predator and it s plot from counter measures oh i m not finished yet it steals footage from storm catcher the scene where jon penner steals the air craft while posing as dolph lundgren now penner is dolph lundgren is for goodness sake ! yet they try to pass it off as dolph lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission this scene made me wanna throw up but i hung in there it turns out more footage is stolen i swear i saw footage from iron eagle and iron eagle ii i saw footage from crimson tide and i saw footage from counter measures what the heck was dolph thinking when he signed for this junk i have no idea when i was a teen when showdown in little tokyo came out i thought dolph lundgren couldn t sink lower then showdown in little tokyo then when i saw the minion i was almost sure dolph couldn t do worse well i pray he can t do any worse because agent red is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life this is coming from a guy who likes don the dragon wilson bottomline on agent red s cover it says once exposed you cannot survive take this as a warning 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
unbox is terrible if you ve ordered from unbox before maybe you ve had better luck but mine has apparently run out i am missing the last minutes of the film i will never download from unbox again the film is locked and can t be burned by most programs the one that did for me produced an incompatible dvd this service is piss poor amazon i m very disappointed 
the rock and vaughn stole the show thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie besides this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it as usual uma s acting is simply dreadful i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad how she became a star in hollywood is beyond me she is not attractive nor can she act she could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn t have changed the movie one bit i think when they need an actress who doesn t mind playing drivel roles they call her john travolta is not much better his version of cool just doesn t do it for me his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so the only reason i gave this movie stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta s scenes i tended to rewind during rock s and vaughn s scenes they were so funny i had to see them again cedric the entertainer was also pretty good 
the worst of the worst as a will ferrell fan i will go easy this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen had i seen this in the theaters i would have demanded my money back 
sub par issue of excellent series the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame like bergman s scenes from a marriage fanny alexander von trier s the kingdom fassbinder s berlin alexanderplatz kusturica s underground and petersen s das boot the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers attention on the large screen via a limited art house run unlike these other series kieslowski s was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block and characters from one episode may pop up in another the stories of the dekalog are morality plays but they are not re enactments of the ten commandments but rather inspired by them and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two kieslowski piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the stories themselves instead of contracting of poland s best up coming director s to do each as was initially planned and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories i won t comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them so i will comment on kieslowski s style kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature his films often tackle issues of political import however he intentionally avoids making issue films but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected as he feels that politics solves nothing that films do not really change the political culture his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before during after the solidarity movement initially he started as a documentary film maker but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film making has an impact on the lives of its subjects he switched to his unique fictional style this facets disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the disc version previously available in that the picture quality is a little better however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series first facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu to add to that you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch after the end of each episode very annoying then the picture quality isn t as good as it could be not only is there evidence of flaws in the film scratches and blotches but the film isn t a true digital copy of the original series but rather a copy of someone s pal tape of the broadcast so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape the picture is also cropped from the original especially on the bottom the picture at times jitters especially during the ending credits the english subtitles are minimal at times missing dialogue and can not be turned off there are some nice extra features particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub use subtitles instead apparently all of the other imported editions of the dekalog are of better quality offer more extras than this edition which is inexcusable given the price 
disjointed erratic and confusing my impression of this movie is that it seems to have been a six hour mini series that was cut down to minutes and not too successfully the only plausible reason i can see for its utterly confusing and disjointed scenes would be that they were trying to create the uncertainty one would feel in a society recently disrupted by some cataclysmic event if there is any sort of plot it is the attempt of a young man to try to care for the orphaned children he wants emily to help him in this endeavor however it seems that every time they get together they engage in sex even when the little kids are in the room with them ! then they sort of break up when the guy wants to take in some feral children or at least children who live like they were brought up by some wild animal what the victorian scenes have to do with the story is anybody s guess some would suggest that it is some sort of fantasy julie christie is having whatever the purpose of the victorian scenes twice they resort to nakedness once is with a decidedly unsexy middle age heavy woman stripping completely naked the second is when four yearold emily is sleeping and her night gown has risen up she turns over on her back fully exposed from mid chest down and some man presumably her father covers her up if they needed to show fully naked children it would seem to me to have been much more understandable to have a group bath of the filthy urchins that joined the children s group little emily coming uncovered and being tucked in by a loving parent isn t anything any parent of a preschool daughter hasn t had naturally happen it is that it just didn t seem to have anything to do with the catastrophe of the movie my conclusion is that this movie is too disjointed and erratic to be of much use in raising any personal or social issues that could be discussed after watching the movie one is much more likely to be asking what was that all about instead of discussing or thinking about some edifying issue it raises 
this film is a disaster tom berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film it has the feel and tone of the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a sunday afternoon when you re too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen the acting is wooden and unnatural and the music which is supposed to be awesome sounds curiously like a bad rip off of springsteen even though the flashbacks in the film when most of the musical scenes occur are set for the most part in when nothing sounded like springsteen worse yet the sets do not look like this is very clearly a cheap production doomed from the start by an awful script terrible acting and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era here s the premise of the film years after eddie the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the cruisers has disappeared he died in a car accident but his body was never recovered a reporter decides to write a story about the band she has a theory that eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance if the missing final recordings named a season in hell can be located she forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members who are by the way dull as dirt to piece together the band s history the reporter is so creepy and annoying that she d probably have a restraining order slapped on her nowadays ironically enough a season in hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience 
this is really stupid this has to be stephen king s worst work adapted this adaptation is even worse than needful things children of the corn i am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels was miles abouve better than this garbage just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book just plain trash 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
clear cutting of sherwood forest video quality could be better and the appearances of featured starwere fewer than expected 
so disappointed i didn t think i d miss the christopher reeve superman movies one and two at least and i really miss george reeves now those black and white superman shows were the best whats her name was a horrible lois lane the whole thing sucked that was the second of two bad movies in a row ! i don t even care about the deleted scenes ! i want to sell it to someone else or at the very least i m going to give this one away brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull ! i remember now that my brother told me i could wait for cable i got greedy someone bought him a dvd that was coded for another country there was russian writing on it and it wouldn t work in my dvd player so i got amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in brooklyn i shoulda waited for cable 
just ok i v seen a multitude of documentaries both low and high budget and although i found the story interesting i felt this film was not up the hype it was given worth seeing but not worth owning 
wolf in sheep skin if you are a christian this book isn t for you it is full of blashphemy concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution since when was god in need of forgiveness isnt it that god so loved the world and it wasnt us that loved god i have no words in describing this book it is full of error because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner and that it isnt your fault and that actully you are a good person why do bad things happen to good people wrong question there are no good people in the world in the first place for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god the world is in sin the world does not have good people only by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book it hasnt helped million people but it lied to them kusher please turn from your ways and come to jesus then will you understand the life question why 
very boring i ve been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo i m just happy i waited untill it came on tv i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it the romance was slim to none i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role well i won t say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it anyway i would much rather watch beautiful thing get real all over the guy the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love 
do not watch this film this film is laughably bad the entire plot is completely unrealistic and it is difficult to have any sympathy for the cruel murderer who is central to the plot who is not only a murderer but also totally retarded missing numerous opportunities to escape and make life easier for himself and the saps who for some random reason have taken it upon themselves to look after him this film is an absolute waste of time but feel free to watch it if you feel like wasting minutes of your life 
seriously stupid i love s horror movies like the exorcist and the changeling this movie is so stupid i turned it off half way through it s poorly acted and not in the charming way that so many older movies are either i would suggest renting it before you buy i just don t know what other reviewers saw in this 
the title of this movie should ve been quotclubs and raves and the young people who go to them oh yeah and the old genius farts that pioneered the music they dance to quot buy my copy please i expected this film to play like a keyboard magazine interview with the artists detailing their influences their gear and how they create their sounds there s a lot of djs standing behind turntables bobbing their heads mere snippets of the new techno bands like prodigy only a passing mention of kraftwerk and no mention at all of the art of noise i was disappointed if you want the real story of techno check out history of rock and roll episode the perfect beat call me therealpeperl yahooco 
awful film barely saved by a couple of decent acting performances the next generation is basically a remake of the original texas chainsaw massacre in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical though different characters and locations are used the original was a little overrated in my opinion and this remake is quite frankly terrible bad acting with the exception of renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several b movie actors the only major differences from the original are that leatherface now dresses as a woman which was fairly amusing but hardly essential and a tacked on conspiracy theory the conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous i won t explain it theres no point watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though even die hards admit its awful i only gave it stars because i reserve star for the very worst of the worst yes even worse than this 
very bad and poor sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews im a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess nothing is moving action is zero and filming is poor we are very far away from dirty dozen battle of the bulge midwayenemy below etc a total waste of time and money 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
cult classic please a waste of my childhood i actually saw this movie when i was and it freaked me out abit but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world dont even rent this i dont even know why you are considering the film i only give it a star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
no s hey lets put hugh grant on the cover and maybe people will buy it well i didnt buy it for hugh however i did buy it because fangoria holds it up pretty high my curiosity got the best of me and i wanted to know why they liked it so much i still wanna know ! the movie was plain boring ! the script introduces one annoying character after the next its a huge mess with bogus effects and a major lack of suspense or terror ! i wanted to find something good i may be able to say about this movie but the only thing that comes to mind is that atleast it ends obviously there are those that get it and those that dont i am proud to say i dont

bogged down liz hurley has her top off or times there is incest lesbian love between sisters inlaw the main character s husband is having an affair with his brother s girlfriend who really isn t his brother s girlfriend she really is his girlfriend that was coming along on the boat trip pretending to be his brother s girlfriend so she could meet his wife who happens to be having some psychic connection with a solved incorrectly murder from years ago on an island with some norwegian people and honest to god the movie is boring sean penn broods leers pains and smokes cigarettes his wife is played by catherine mccormack who is like a young charolette rampling very watchable but condemned to a weak role liz hurley acts very vampy and takes her top off unforgettable all this and the movie drags and drags liz stops taking her top off at the mark which then forces you to realize how bad the movie is the parallel stories just don t come off actually it is a one star movie liz taking her top off boots it one extra star 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
so sleazy you actually giggle at some points sleazy s exploitation film with some panache features super agent ginger chasing down white slavers ample sex and violence will please certain contingents while semi feminist heroine campy dialogue will satisfy others 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
an affair to remember i think the newer version the love affair with warren beatty annette benning better 
it s been forgotten for a reason this film is painfully outdated and it was never good to begin with i suppose you would have to call this a romantic thriller comedy and it fails on every one of these fronts the thriller portion is preposterous nothing but a convoluted story from a s tv show it s not particularly funny either oh but it tries to be the romance portion probably comes across the best but this is only because of the excellent actors in the leads no what into the night has going for it is a quirky unique premise that it never delivers on landis seems more concerned with jamming the scenes with pointless cameos and in jokes this film which could have been regarded as an underground classic has none of the substance to garner such praise and it does not receive it after hours which came out the same year is vastly superior the best thing about into the night is watching a young gorgeous pre catwoman michelle pfeiffer some la landmarks that have since been demolished ships diner and the original one sheet poster is very very cool 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped

stupid this is an absolutely absurd movie with a stupid storyline bad characters bad character development and a really dumb predictable ending yaw 
nice story wooden acting apparently a film that many women who have read the book with effort and imagination make enjoyable pretty scenery such as walks along the ocean the costumes are often exceptional there is wonderful singing in one scene and over the closing credits the less imaginative those who have not read the book and men will find characters including anne the captain display wooden acting poker faces others speak at a clipped pace the properness of the times allowed for personality as shown well in pride prejudice but not here shyness plainness or slowness may be portrayed likeably with some personality but not here both anne the captain maintain wide eyed desperate looks constantly many of us do get nervous within romance but we are compelled by conversation and activity to interrupt our nervousness with personality thus anne s the captain s constant wide eyed nervousness is un natural all of us at the age of anne and the captain would have refined our nervousness clearly showing shyness or thought or distance or hopefulness or approval or alarm poor directing you understand the quiet thoughts because of the story in spite of the confusing paralyzed looks rather than because of them you come to like anne and the captain toward the end in spite of the wooden acting because of the novelist s story a female reviewer who liked the film cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film a poor script for those who have not read the book good period romance films are so few and so desired that many women who have read the book work and imagine an enjoyable film better than it otherwise is i applaud their positive imaginations however they continued their imaginative thoughts into rating the production of this film i would like to see this good story idea re made with a better script by a better director wellmade romance films are pride prejudice wives daughters north south and naughty marietta with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy fairly made is under the greenwood tree 
if your a true iron chef fan foodtv dont waste your do not confuse this with the real thing i found teh vhs of this for at a store near me i was interested so i got it i watch iron chef on the food network evey night and this dosent even begin to hold a candle to it ! the one commentator is a failed comedian and the other is a culinary half wit i never heard more ussless facts in a min span b in my life the chefs in the first baattle were for lack of a better term dissrespectful i mean come on how are you gonna have a cell phone on you and answer it during a cooking battle they kept cutting away from the cooking to show interview clips with the chefs the cooks were pretty good they had a decent talent but we didnt get to see as much of it here as you do on the real show there flour reporter keeps bugging them thru out the whole thing asking questionspassed down from the dumb announcer they kept tryign to play shatner off as a culinary genius but come on we all know that he is nothing but a medeocore actor out side of star trek or wat ever he was on the only you see shatner is when he is talking about clearly prewritten statements that sound kinda incoherant lol all in all i give this stars and that purely gose ot the merit of the chefs not to the shows them selfs unless your a shatner fanatic or sone won thats just kinnda like its cooking i ll watch it but be warned its not as good as it could be glad i only spen on it bc its truely not worth more 
a stellar book a disappointing movie my boys and i read my side of the mountain together for our homeschooling lessons i can t tell you how much we loved the book ! jean craighhead george does a remarkable job of taking the reader deep into the wilderness of the catskills complete with reference to washington irving s rip vanwinkle we were delighted by each and every page why in the world any screen write would change such a marvelous creation is beyond me ! the movie wasn t even close to the novel and we felt like it was a complete waste of time to watch i can only wonder what the book s author must have felt watching a washed and clearly faded rendition of her creation she must have been deeply disappointed the book itself would make a wonderful screenplay all its own we truly hope that someone will resurrect the story and put it on the screen in all its glory until then this movie is not it ! save your money buy the book ! 
why does jet li star in wong jing films this film has been re released as meltdown there are a few reasons for watching this movie jet li chingmy yau the reporter wu ma frankies dad a decent fight scene at the end jacky cheung is also not as aggravating as usual that s it jet li has appeared in three or four films directed by wong jing and just as chow yun fat does in god of gamblers and jackie chan does in city hunter he does what he can the direction of the film however as well as gog and ch stinks the plot copies die hard and speed with some broad satire aimed at jackie chan but that is not the problem put simply jackie chan knows how to direct a film wong jing does not if you want to see jet li go see fist of legend once upon a time in china or just about anything else he has done if you want to see a good hong kong action movie watch films directed by john woo ringo lam tsui hark jackie chan and sammo hung jet li is fun to watch but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this 
where s the passion recently i read about the revival of a chorus line on broadway i ve never seen the broadway show or any other staging of it so i thought the movie might give me a sneak peek well somewhat disappointed here i can only assume that the stage version with its long running reputation must be better than this film it s not that the film is a total debacle but it s only mildly pleasant and quickly forgettable even songs which i had heard before like what i did for love were reduced to barely a mention in the film the film seemed to lack any real point a bit of a yawner 
a dog this movie is a dog pure and simple we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought they can t sell it so they re giving them away hide fast 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
quotsounds like a bad action movie quot the plot for this movie is actually quite good a microbiochemical weapon accidently created and released on the world is captured and is being brought back from russia but the russians are trying to recapture it and release it on the major cities of the world and it is up to our quotheroquot to stop them before it happens what ruins this great movie is the very bad acting when asked if he knew about agent red dolph s character said it best quotsounds like a bad action movie quot and it is from lt christian being seriously out of uniform to the underlying quotlove story quot this movie just reeks the only good thing i saw in this movie was randolph mantooth his small part made up for the movie in my opinion so unless you re a big mantooth fan this movie is a waste of money 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
terrible i have never not been able to sit through a rated g movie however my sister and i rented this thinking it would be a funny show and it was so terribly boring that i was forced to leave the room i couldn t believe it because i love movies i can see how this movie would be funny for a year old boy to watch but don t count on the parents or older siblings being able to sit through it 
spend a couple hours of your life with vile people of all the hateful self centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie the one i found most offensive was the one involving emilio estevez andie macdowell isn t stalking hilarious and isn t kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you ve ever seen i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little kirby i also loved at the end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy and judd nelson that she just wants them all to be friends to which they both reply the classic cinema line ehhhh ok wow now that s drama 
overproduced and pointless shakespeare s play already contains plenty of time shifts ancient athens meets fairlyland which in turn meets elizabethan tradespeople turnedthespiansadding layers of th century italy to the mix and bicycles and windeup gramophones and a repetitive recycling of italian opera s greatest hits on the soundtrack just muddies things up lots of money went into this production and it does have some nice visuals but there is no genuine artistic vision here less would have been more the two stars are for the director s concept not for author william s whose best lines are just about impossible to ruin 
why why someone tell me why someone e mail me and explain to me why there is nothing to gain here nothing to be learned nothing to excite no story why seriously is there any documentation that might explain why this thing not a film exists return of the texas chainsaw massacre is so unprecedented in it s poorness that it doesn t even succeed in being a dumb slasher flick let me reiterate the filmmakers actually failed at the least complicated genre in the book if i wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere i would have rented week end the only reason to see this is that ever crafty curiosity value yes you will be compelled to watch if only to observe some clue as to why both matthew mcconaughey prea time to kill and rene zellweger prejerry maguire accepted the lead roles the clue never comes texas chain saw fans will of course feel the completist need to see this the death knell of the series and finally i think just the concept of leatherface as a shrieking cross dresser will garnish a few bewildered viewers but believe me folks this still doesn t answer the ultimate question why why why 
medicore at best i really felt like i had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not you people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie with how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up from a close friendship to a romantic relationship the guys don t even display a close friendship at the beginning how are they gonna jump from a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building to hot and heavy can t live without each other love its not believable and doesn t make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be the movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene and from there they are suddenly in love and everything in fact there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene i mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time or even was interested in guys in general but as i said before the movie doesn t display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene dont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren t really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are highly overrating it so if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy if you re looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship look somewhere else this is not the movie 
damaged package for dvd dvd came in the mail ripped up dvd lose inside package 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
nothing golden about this one this film is based on a concept that has potential a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things but it doesn t deliver clearly the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us but he pretty much drops the ball right there usually with this sort of plot you are at least given the illusion that someone knows the answer and what s more has some clue about what to do with it as well there s no such suspension of disbelief in this one nor even an attempt at such adding injury if you count eye strain to insult the whole thing is shot in grainy b w with annoying mtv style jump cuts in the awards for obnoxious splash films of the year this one takes the cake but not the pi 
lack of blonde ambition i only gave this movie stars because of its stars mamie van doren and jayne mansfield without the presence of these bombshells the film is a complete bomb as a piece of film history it has its place as entertainment it s atrocious even for the time still as i ve said it does have mamie jayne ! the male actors are laughable and the plot virtually non existent although you can say that about a lot of modern films too only get this film if you re passionate about its lusty blonde actresses otherwise get a life 
two smart girls grow up i would have rated it three stars if it would have had all three girls from the original but since it didn t two stars the plot drags and while deanna gives a good performance it was hard to see helen parrish as kay craig kay grew up all right she grew up into an entirely different person ! nan grey s presence is nostalgic as was charles winninger reprising his role but it lacks what three smart girls had fun the songs however are very good an uneven sequel that proves that even during hollywood s golden age sequels have never really worked 
ummmm ok this movie had barely any cool d sequences was boring and babyish juni gets zapped into a video game the acting is pretty bad and there is pretty much no story it s just flying around on machines is that entertainment or what sarcasm you could enjoy it if you were a year old but since you are on this site you probably aren t three so i would not reccomend this movie to you 
overlong and forced feels like an imposter this didn t feel like an authentic seuss just as another reviewer has pointed out the narrative is stiff the rhymes lacking fluidity and humor and the story is just plain dull although i have no problem at all with presenting anti war and anti armsproliferation sentiment in a format suitable for a child i don t think that this book does it well the overall impression i get is that of a message being sent in the style of seuss with rehashed elements rather than a genuinely entertaining seuss book 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
you can t go home again i knew woodrow call and jon voight is no woodrow call voight is less than nothing return to lonesome dove is less than nothing but perhaps i m being unfair since i bailed after the first abysmal hour the only element of interest from that first hour was oliver reed s donnegan and only because of the wraith in donnegan s improbable montana mansion the wraith is awbonnie a native servant who flits through a few frames with elle woods witherspoon donnegan is probably a hack hollywood stand in for granville stuart montana s grand old man who married a shoshone woman named awbonnie one of their dusky daughters married another grand old man of montana teddy blue abbot cowpuncher and best bud of charlie russell donnegans attempt to comingle elle mr newt suggests to me that elle is not donnegan s wife as advertised and that awbonnie is if anyone anywhere gritted through the next four preposterous hours of return let me know if i m right 
cheesy sci fi flick only has some good things to offer but its really silly josh charles swat tv s sports night finds out that he is the bearer of a key that can make you travel into different dimensions andrea roth brings him to her friend played by rutger hauer the hitcher sin city who guides charles and tells him that his father was a timedimensional warrior and that he could be too as well on the evil end baddie stuart wilson no escape the mask of zorro wants the key and the septer that goes along with it so he can fuse worlds together and be the ruler and what not and the trio must bring back the septer to the right place before evil hands get on it and the fate of the world is at risk interesting idea is squandered by sillyness and dumb dialouge and some pretty crummy acting altough charles saves this from being a total disaster it s good to see hauer not being a bad guy but he s wasted along with wilson and well it was surprising to see jack black school of rock king kong in this movie one before he became famous black does his mannerisms and speech watch it once and then dimension jump the hell out of the room 
not very likeable or fun i felt more sympathetic toward the hookers and sex workers in km and the porn folks in fluffer than i did with these sad scheming nasty theives they basically drive their uncapable third partner to suicide by being really hateful to him even though the father loves him the only decent character is the young man they recruit to replace the ailing man who turns out has a thing both for women and men in this case father and daughter it could be interesting but it s lost here among the artificial feeling grittiness and endless series of theft attempts which pass for story bascially i didn t relate to or care much about the characters who didn t have much redeeming value and who didn t learn anything during the movie and they are all really bad to each other there are lots better choices than this 
a sorry movie i wrote a huge review for this and don t know where it is but let me give you the short version they don t continue the story that is until the end of the movie and that was the part trhat ruined the movie for me the movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married enter the bride she of course doesn t want anybody to be happy so the story is not really worth going over it is just injected and there are no real emotions except of course for an ending that really po ed me the only reason this movie gets a stars and almost gets a is for christy chung not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth she is a great actress so i know of movies now that are only worth watching for her this and red wolf it may be because the people she works with are so terrible but to tell the truth christy chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time not a big deal since it was only like a minute long movie 
the legend exceeds the reality i have always been an avid fan of westerns in general and charlton heston in particular but this is one of those movies where the legend surrounding it far exceeds the actual viewing even allowing for its having been butchered by the studioscharlton heston of course plays major dundee a man with a very forceful character resolute determined and even rebellious invading mexico and attacking the french army for such a man to later be found as a hopeless drunk wallowing in the gutters of durango is thoroughly incomprehensible the purpose of the invasion of mexico is to capture or destroy the apache indian charriba so one would expect the audience to watch the movie in anticipation of a great climax when the two sides finally meet when they do meet however the action is over in less than a minute and charriba is simply shot by michael anderson jnr so the climax is in my view an anti climaxwe are then presented with a new climax when dundee and his men have to defeat the french army in order to get back across the rio grande although this encounter is a lot more exciting than the one with the apaches the overall effect as far as i am concerned is rather like the effect one gets when reading a murder mystery to discover that the murderer is somebody who only entered in the final pages and the scene where a wounded richard harris single handedly takes on the other half of the french army is so unexpected in view of what has gone on before as to be virtually unbelieveable with regard to the movie having been heavily cut by the studios i would suggest that if any cuts had to be made they should have cut the durango scenes entirely plus all of the scenes featuring senta berger romance only slows down the action and adds nothing to the story whilst too much romance leads to boredom finally having watched the movie with the new score first and then with the original score i have to say that i preferred the original the movie opens with charriba saying to an upside down strung up soldier who are you going to send after me now the original then has the opening title major dundee accompanied by the mitch miller sing along gang singing the major dundee march to me this is a much more stirring and rousing score than the new replacement and sets the scene for what one hopes will be an exciting movie by all means buy this dvd as a piece of movie history and as part of either a charlton heston or sam peckinpah collection even though peckinpah disowned it but for my money don t expect a western anything like as great as the likes of the big country the magnificent seven or how the west was won 
ridiculous ending not worth watching this movie was captivating and interesting for the first ths of it it is a psychological thriller mystery and you obviously want to find out the big explanation at the end that resolves all your questions well the ending was so incredibly far fetched and crazy that i can t believe that anyone who read the whole script actually wanted to work on this movie it ends up being a stupid scifi type ending so if you want to get all into a movie only to have them resolve it with the most ridiculous scenario possible buy this one ordont 
drag on inn the description of this dvd led me to expect a movie like musa or warriors of heaven and earth id have even been happy with a movie comparable to crouching tiger this movie isn t up to the standards of any of these movies though more of a farce than anything close to an adventurethe scenery is wasted with a lame plot that drags on and makes the movie seem about twice as long as it really is perhaps if my own expectations had been lower i wouldn t be so harsh on this movie but compared to musa or warriors of heaven and earth its defintely sub standard different strokes as they say perhaps you ll enjoy this movie i didn t 
easily forgotten it didn t take me long to forget this film once again it stars jet in a strange role 
amazon com likes to take my money this is another story that i don t know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails doesn t seem to work if they didn t have the best prices for movies i d leave 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
there s always jaws with the exception of jaws and possibly deep blue sea you could take all these shark attack movies and lump them together just change the actors sometimes the location but you end up with the same thing poor special effects so so acting and some occasional laughs and or thrills this entry like the other two shark attack movies is generic fluff with little novelty or variety to distinguish it the cast of thorsten kaye as the studly hero nikita alger the hot diver and daniel alexander the studly if obnoxious steve irwin clone gamely tries to breathe life but this is just another movie in which the shark should have eaten the whole bunch 
i don t see why people like this i m sorry but i really don t it s a style called celtic drama which means it s a combination of stories w o words and traditional irish dancing ive never been a michael flatley person parts of this are traditional irish dancing but other s aren t anywhere near it ! there are also long songs sort of like a choir piece i don t like those at all if you want to see traditional irish dancing this is not your movie 
shoudl be stars there is a reason there are used ones of this book we used this book in for our men s study group and every one of the men and every one of the wives agreed that this was a worthless book it was written for a s wife that no longer exists now truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are discovering the mind of a woman by ken nairif only he knew by gary smalleytogether forever how to overcome problems and rekindle the love in your marriageby anne kristin carrollthey are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband 
one of the worse in a while not enough camp to make it fun if a movie is going to be really bad it should have some camp value added in i e real humor of some kind some excitement and unexpected events and some good hammy dialog this groaner has almost none of these things at least to my understanding i did watch this two times over the years once in the theatre and another buying this tape for cents i really do like most science fiction films i ve seen in the last years including many critical failures and campy low budget and high budget films so i am qualified to submit an opinion lost is space does have some entertainment value for kids it is just ok if you can turn down your iq rather drastically and lower expectations also i was able to do both a little the second time and enjoyed it somewhat in the theatre i ended up walking out before the ending this is the only time i have done this because of a movie one other time i did because of an audience laughing at some torture scenes but that is another story both times i saw this the first part really seems like it is supposed to be a video game and there is some expectation or question of when is the movie going to start the problem is it never does saying the story has not much revelance has become a cliche for movie reviewers who don t have enough to support their arguments but in this case it is very true nearly every twist and turn of this story there are a lot for such a bad movie causes the story to worsen so by the end when the story has no ending one really doesn t care at all knowing that a needed sequel never got made gives one a feeling of justice in the universe 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
the film that sunk two careers two of a kind has a unique distinction of being somewhat responsible for sinking two acting careers olivia newton john coming off the dismal reviews from the critically underappreciated xanadu was reteamed with john travolta her well matched partner from grease it s obvious that rather than wait for an appropriate script to come along that would showcase the pair to their best advantages this film was hurriedly put together simply to team them up once again and salvage olivia s acting career two of a kind starts off with god the voice of gene hackman deciding that humankind has made his world a wasteland and mulling over the idea of having another great flood and just starting over a trio of enterprising angels talks him out of it at least temporarily emphasizing how redeemable humankind is god goes along with it on the condition that two people must sacrifice everything for the other now what two people do you think god will choose newtonjohn plays debbie a wanna be actress living in new york and working as a bank teller it seems that she has gotten a little behind in her payments and her furnishings are on the verge of being repo ed along with her landlord being a little testy about the rent being late travolta is zack a down on his luck inventor who is in deep debt and figures that robbing a bank will solve all his problems the attempted bank robbery is comical with debbie taking the money and zack taking home a bag full of worthless receipts debbie is fired for flirting with the bank robber but apparently no one thinks to check her pockets she immediately buys new furniture pays the landlord and no one including her roommates wonders how she can drop so much money after just being fired in the meantime zack tracks debbie down wanting his money no surprise here the two fall for each other and even with the devil making cameo appearances attempting to upset the heavenly angels applecart at keeping debbie and zack on track the two sacrifice humankind is saved and our duo end up in each other s arms fade out while this should have been a feast for travolta and newton john fans the fact that both characters are playing so out of type throws the whole picture off in her previous two roles newton john plays sweet innocent type girls probably how the movie audience wants to see her debbie is hardly sweet and innocent she thinks nothing of stealing money from the bank she s working at and spending it foolishly travolta still in his boy nextdoor good guy phase is the con maninventorhapless bank robber certainly no danny zuko and while travolta and newton john look gorgeous together they just didn t generate the same chemistry here that they did in greasenot surprisingly this film was a bomb in its initial release newton johns song twist of fate was a nice little hit but not much else good came from this pic newton johns acting career was finished and after the perfectly disastrous perfect several years later travolta s acting career was also sent into deep freeze although it would thaw out in later years all in all a sad end to newton johns acting career and the cinematic partnership of newton john and travolta 
not the real thing if you saw the original broadway cast of fosse perform you would realize how sad this video really is if you want to see real fosse choreography rent or buy one of his movies 
couldn t watch the whole thing the best parts of this film were the minute long landscape shots free of dialog and narrative at those points you could almost forget the absolute dullness of every character and plot aspect contrary to the gushing of the majority this is not even a love story so much as it is a celebration of selfishness and treating others poorly don t let the wwii period piece propaganda fool you on this granted i turned it off after hours out of sheer dread and boredom so maybe this flaming sack of doo redeemed itself in the last hour 
the most overrated foreign movie of all time i saw this on tcm years ago and i thought what is all the fuss about i do not like how it glorifies that leaving your wife and kid is swell the men look more like lady s then the men in this movie that are after her also this movie is so long and boring don t get me wrong i like foreign films even the ones that are slow like wild strawberries umberto d and such but this one did nothing for me another thing his wife is alot more actrative then the woman he desires you can tell i did not mention character names well i forgotten them i only seen this moive me once and that was enough a other thing i need to mentin why is that criterion charges so much for there dvds other dvds are restored as well and they are cheaper and most of chiterion dvds do not even have a whole lot of bonus features

good movie bad copy good movie bad copy i ordered it because it was cheap however picture quality is poor fuzzy washed out blurry it looks like it s recorded in superlongplay the shortness of the tape would seem to confirm this 
be warned i love this film it s epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves i d have given stars if it had so the minus three is for the appaling print one of the worst i ve ever seen 
nothing to write home about the review on the cover of the dvd reads a snappy sexy thriller i must disagree this was the most unsexy and unthrilling movie i ve seen in a long time in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll it s almost comedic twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production the film s ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination my vote just okay nothing to write home about 
and you thought reading the book in high school was a killer just try sitting through this humdrum humorless dramaless lash up it is a far far better thing to rent the ronald colman version it is a far better rest you will get while sleeping through this travesty masterpiece theater got the emperor s new clothes instead of a tale of two cities madame defarge as a pin up model indeed switch her with miss pross and you ve got it avoid this movie at all costs stars for putting your english class to sleep teachers 
the book is better i watched this on masterpiece theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book the characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you don t have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny droning music 
painful to watch another product of hollywood s karaoke culture in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind we have in u an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war we get a cheap flag waving pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors and absurd scenarios an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit put this ridiculous movie in its own category u is just another thin over promoted throw away movie you ll forget the day after you see it 
i know fred twoo the personality of a nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance fred leuchter was painted as such by many people some who knew him and i m guessing knew better and as we may be witnessing others who didn t brownshirts insult assault rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas maybe a major lesson of the holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to so long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas there must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist so that they may prove their allegiance to the group maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent as dissent does not equal disloyalty except in a nazi state there was a great free press in germany in nazi times so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries mr death is not representation of fred leuchter fred leuchter is representation of fred leuchter might i suggest not suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary that s not clarification that s reinforcement of one idea rather go and find fred and speak to him get his view if you don t have a preformed agenda like van pelt or morris you may get him to respond like i did i found a different fred and a much much different story than i was given by director morris and others the question is not whether german gas chambers were used to murder people the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that or any other idea that is without having his house firebombed a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place have his reputation ruined or any of the other stuff happen if fred s ordeal is any indication the brownshirts are alive and well but i don t think fred is one of them the one fact i would alter in my previous post is rabbi bauer s support for no gas chambers bauer supported fred s methods not necessarily his conclusion i tried in vain to contact bauer on where he differs with fred fred has high regard for rabbi bauer the polish forensic investigation which came soon after fred s did not come to the same conclusion as fred but did essentially duplicate fred s data collection methods and results there was testimony at the nuremburg trials by both inmates and german staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in germany in physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there it took years for simon weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those german concentration camps a former inmate at auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there but all this isn t to say that the auschwitz gassings didn t occur but rather to simply say that some may think they didn t occur and for that they shouldn t be condemned unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like fred 
disney why are you editing censoring the complaints about this dvd release are all correct great movie low qaulity release yet i m surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most the self censorship the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer we re ok to witness a pirate being drunk but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate what are the execs at disney thinking if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such questionable material as they did with many of the vault collection fine but stop chopping up the movies our ten year old children are not buying these movies many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we re being ripped off stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title 
great movie lousy lousy transfer this is one of clint s best but the transfer is awful all dark scenes are grainy highly pixellated the daylight scenes fortunately the balance of the movie are ok movie stars transfer star

the tommyknockers got ahold of this movie and put their own little spin on it going to split this into reviews one based on it from the book the other just based on the movie in general the book the tommyknockers is set in the town of haven maine where strange thing s start to happen to the townspeople after bobbie anderson find s a large mysterious object in the woods behind her farm curious she starts digging it up and with each shovel full of removed dirt open s up a terrifying and life altering experience for all those involved the movie based on the stephen king novel starsi watched the movie after reading the book my own personal rule and though at time s felt like they were true to the book was often left going huh at the changes that were implemented certain thing s are left out while replaced by hollywood s cheap imagination the missing teeth as well as the batteries and inventions running off them never really hit home and though the book had a multitude of characters who had important part s of the story we see some simply vanish and never make it to the mini series perhaps the tommyknockers got to them first ! since it was a miniseries and ran over hours there was no reason to chop and hack this thing up and replace it with alternate scenarios and a different ending i was disappointed to see how hilly was found as well as the fate of gard and the ship and marge s ultimate destiny comes out differently as well the movie in general without comparing it to the book starsmargie helgenberger and jimmy smit s do a very good part cast as bobbie and gard the overall pace of the mini series roll s along well and the production and directing is okay the sound is good and set s the mysterious mood that the town of haven is faced with disappearing people mysterious inventions run off batteries and a mob like atmosphere are all displayed as we wait to see who the tommyknockers are and what exactly they want with the townspeople of haven an excellent cast overall considering the many various character s that had to be portrayed in the story 
drama about domestic terrorists this film starts with an event based on a true crime a talk radio show host in denver was killed by an american nazi this event inspired the talk radio play and film this film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region no mention of their economic status are they losing dollars and population small businesses etc instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him ! this seems too exaggerated to believe federal agents are aware of this but don t want to act yet their agent is sent back to get more information there are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas the film doesn t explain what created them it shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions no real names of course the federal agent meets to report to her higher ups then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities based on real events most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group the fbi put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the s this federal agency doesn t interfere because they want more information on their aims and their leaders more terrorism is planned dynamiting a courthouse attacking a power station etc the terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy hours a day ! kathy finds a secret list of friends this is quickly copied with a camera the federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them gary meets with the leader who arrives in a helicopter and shows documents that say kathy is a special investigator is kathy being served up as a sacrifice gary and kathy travel to chicago where an assassination is planned that will make gary the fall guy another lee harvey oswald a second lone gunman shoots the politician in front of a building gary fails to shoot and won t ever try this again costagavras gained world fame with his film z a few years later his film about rebels in south america was popular his later films have seemed mediocre a better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does better pacing could help the threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film eg timothy mcveigh those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts a better film today would show the bad results from nafta and free trade in harming most americans economically but hollywood would never allow a film about this war on the middle class the word nafta in greek and arabic refers to petroleum nafta is a symbol for the policies designed for big oil it is like george w bush calling his policy operation iraqi liberation 
mansfield park anyone basing their understanding of this austen novel on this movie alone will be misled perhaps the director or producer wanted to make the film relevant to today s hip audiences which don t understand anything sophisticated while the film was helpful to me in establishing the characters prior to my reading the book itself i found that the novel has none of the raciness or even some of the scenes that are found in this film as is often the case viewers will find that the book is much better than the movie the acting is fine but what the actors are asked to act is not faithful to how the real story unfolds 
over edited and badly too this show is probably a thousand times better in person than on video i couldn t say if i agree that the dancing is good because i never got to see enough of it at once to know there are so many changes in camera angle from feet to face to distance and back again and from all areas of the stage that i got a headache it s too bad i bet if this had been done properly it d be great viewing 
not the worst movie ever made first of all this is not the worst movie ever made nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars the worst movie ever made was autumn in new york but that is a different review no this not a great movie but it is very interesting and for once thank god it doesn t end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie bleak more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing for molly ringwald she didn t do anything of note again until the stand six years later and for andrew mccarthy well it could be argued that he still hasn t starred in anything of note again although he probably made some money from weekend at bernies i ii anyway probably better to rent than buy i am only buying it to complete my s collection 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
here we go again i gave this movie star because it is not a true documentary it falls more along the same fodder as spinal tap it is missing a counter point from gm one could argue that roger had chances to talk with moore but choose not to one the other hand rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold i believe that moore counted on not being granted air time at gm for the production of this film an interview would have killed the tone watch the nightly news now last night march nd gm offered a one time buy out to some of it s employees the news reported that gm cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the uaw just like what caused the flint situation in the film this same thing happened in the late s and brought forth this extremely biased movie this film is entertaining in a strange way but should not be considered to be the absolute truth watch it with a grain of salt for what it s worth under close examination careful consideration andkeen intellect you will see a undercover messageyou might need to examine closely the content outwardly things are not what they seemuntil you look more closely many times the basic concept ismisread in the dialogonce you see this andopen your mind to it rational thought willemerge 
awful spend your money for some other dvd if you re interested in watching this movie just rent it 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money

thomas hardy not even oliver hardy after two hours of watching it i still don t know what it was about yes the scenery is fantastic but a national geographic film would have done more i applaud the acting of milla jovovich and nastassja kinski but the kudos reviewers have given to peter mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie i hardly heard anything he said and there are no english subtitles offered on the dvd as for wes bentley that s acting he kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him or a co worker being blown to kingdom come thats a pun based on the movie he makes clint eastwood look like laurence olivier the film is supposedly based on a thomas hardy book but very loosely based and the scriptwriters should have at least used cliff notes to have learned more about the story and the character development they obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
let s bore jessica to death the first halfif they had made movies back then in it would move as slowly as this perhaps that date suits the film to perfection the days of utter simplicity with nearly nothing happening where maybe days are filled with yourself not distractions after half an hour all i could think was if this was on tv not only would everybody switch off the sh show would be axed it may even beat so many foregin movies as the slowest movie of all time but slow really means empty the other half of me yet i have since come to learn by others reviews this is a movie which you must make by the mood or the feeling of dread others speak of or else you are left with the feeling of dead i failed to do that and without that the film fails miserably i reckon perhaps because i am dead so therefore i envy those creative creatures of subtle senses or whether it was because they were so simple or easily pleased which means more modest more modern so as in real life it s only the feeling which makes anything real my first or worst halfthe other part of me thought that the film being a feature length they think they can just not try for half an hour an hour such is the problem with many filmakers even today when being a torture err feature they should try much harder ! therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire virtually nothing happens and what does makes little sense as any unconcious creation my better half of the schizophrenicbut the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine and not being stereotype is pleasingly real weird as suits the role as are the others natural with no hollywood posing how often have i heard that story good acting bad film oh i m sorry i did it again the only thing exciting is the title the wholemy conclusion is i don t know which is my better half and which is my worst half so all things being unequal i choose both i stand and fall by both my views i guess that s why god gave us eyes i was going to give it only one star at first but now i give it merely two knowing i m still mean i see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one s temperament if you feel better than me are supernaturally sensitive or have the patience of a saint to me add one two or three more stars respectively i intend to watch it again and then maybe i can give a before and after shot please feel free to reject me write negative comments about me or scare me or kill me the world s first amazoning interactive review that makes it fair 
defective filmmaking willy wonka meets dr strangelove in this one ofakind cinematic disaster barry levinson s longtime dream project emerges as a garish nightmare the impressive production design wears out its welcome after five minutes while a talented cast sinks in the big budget quagmire another unfilmable concept that somehow received the hollywood green light 
the absolute worst this movie is a total waste of time even audrey hepburn can t save it but she didn t have much to work with she drifts about the whole movie dressed in what seems to be a long flour sack and bare feet putting curses on her grandfather and making eyes at anthony perkins who is supposed to be from south america but has no accent at all even the locales are confused with part of the movie looking like it was filmed in the amazon and part in the desert southwest i love audrey but i wouldn t own this movie even if i taped it for nothing off amc or turner classic 
please enter a title for your review interesting premise but the plot is like swiss cheese this review will just be a point by point of all the major things that i found so implausable that i couldn t just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride spoilers alert i wasn t able to make the leap to believing sarah s sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash when questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn t afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort but satisfaction why did hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it surely it wouldn t be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it s disappearance the first murder after the old guy regained consciousness why did hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him for hank finishing the job his brother started didn t seem like an absolute last resort it seemed like he took the murder lightly when hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he d just done what like he knew she d be understanding about it or something hi honey i m home by the way i just killed a man to protect the money wtf when jacob shot lou to protect hank why didn t hank just give the tape back before it got to that point the shotgun impact on lou s wife was cartoonishly ridiculous sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn t even hit her at an upward trajectory and the final ridiculous flaw jacob taking the fake fbi agent s gun and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react he hands it to his brother and charges him with the responsibility of killing him setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn t look like the fake fbi agent shot jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range but why not why couldn t forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff wrestled with him and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head it really makes no sense one inspiredly believable moment i will give them film credit for is hank s difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff s office and loading the gun a lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded if the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film as it is it s a frustratingly flaw ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch 
le boring i think there was packaging or a sticker that compared this film to pulp fiction as if beyond minor superficial similarities i dont see it le samurai is one of the most boring films ive watched recently without turning it off in retrospect i wish i had turned it off or never wasted my time since the ending is so dull imagine if breathless had a slightly more complicated plot but the main character had no charisma or if alphaville the film not the treatment was more times more boring le samurai makes tokyo drifter seem like a thrill ride i was not impressed by this film on any level if you are into being bored or if your so freaking smart you can watch paint drying and fill it with significance this is the film for you 
can you say fast forward a failed spoof on sci fi genre luckily this is a movie about how to make movies it is designed to teach you how to keep your actresses from losing their heads or from losing any other appendages the movie s main thrust seems to be concentrated on upper torso frontal extensions several pair while observing this movie i learned about the fast forward button and suggest you do the same 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
david and bathsheba as we know this is famous bible move i had seen this very long times ago when i was young i wanted to see this again i hope to say just this old move 
blah blah blah this has got to be the worst film i ve ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i don t have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he s sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i ve seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television notes this film had some great talenta song from olivia newton jon and one of my most personal favorites mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she s to good but why this film she and mila are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this 
what were they thinking man i don t know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking but it should be illegal ! this is first off a terrible dvd full screen format with a dark muddy picture worse the plot is typical predictable and poorly written other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher s body sitting through this fiasco is a total bore i was also surprised at how bad teri s acting was in this movie since i ve seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this that is probably the fault of the director erik anjou a third rate director at best who has done a total of two movies and one documentary gee i wonder why he isn t in more demand not i can enjoy b movies and bad movies but this one is just so totally non involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at i can t imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher s current popularity and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger year old teri hatcher nude rent this if you must but wow there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad 
if you loved terms of endearment never watch this film i adore terms of endearment it s a movie that time and time again has never failed to touch my heart and make my cry i have known about the evening star for a long time but i just got around to seeing it for the first time while it was fortunate that shirley maclaine reprised her role as aurora the film didn t have the same chemistry that made terms of endearment such a memorable and much loved film the cast was just off with nobody except for marion ross delivering a much appreciated and genuine performance aurora returns in the evening star as a woman who has been weakened and instead of seeing her as she was and as she was loved we see her adapt to the lives of her loser grandchildren with little contest it s not the same aurora from the first film the aurora we see in evening star doesn t have the same essence of houston class the same sharp wit and overall she is a different woman than the aurora you grew used to in terms of endearment watching this movie was painful just because it was so predictable and well it was just lacking that soul that made the first film so special this movie was put together so poorly and it really shows emotional scenes are poorly done because whomever wrote the screenplay really tried to make everything over thetop so when there was a crisis it became an emotional spectacle with the entire cast instead of an intimate and thoughtful event between certain characters when tragedy would strike you d have a room full of characters you don t care about dilluting the scene and creating a disconnect in the moment i give the film star and that is only because we get a moment of time with jack nicholson marion ross did a good job and shirley maclaine came back to do her very best under the circumstances these people are the only minute saving factor in this entire upset of a film honestly though if you really love terms of endearment you may find yourself let down by the evening star i personally wish that i hadn t of watched it and allowed for the story to end with the first film overall i advise if you loved terms of endearment never watch this film 
the harvey girls review i really enjoyed the movie the story background is the fred harvey restaurants and concessions at train stations my father worked for fred harvey at the chicago and cleveland facilities regarding the movie and judy garland the movie is great and judy was one of my favorite entertainers lane hanse 
what a disappointment after seeing the first resident evil movie and liking it i was expecting a whole lot more from this film which i had been anticipating as soon as i found out they were going to make a sequel unfortunately re apocalypse doesn t have any of the things that made the first one good ! resident evil was first and foremost a horror movie with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci fi touch a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the re world the make up and special effects were top notch and all of the actors including the ones with minor roles did a fantastic job re apocalypse accomplishes none of these things if you re expecting a horror movie what you get is a weird combination of the kung fu and action genres there s no character development the plot is shallow and even mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one i found the movie to be extremely boring and run ofthemill and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they d improved upon the first movie s many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses in short this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one which is set to be released next year somebody would literally have to pay me to see it ! 
considering when it was made not too bad a movie this was undoubtedly a propaganda film but if one remembers when it was made and makes the necessary allowances it s not bad a bad movie and it s not totally agitprop there is no doubt for e g that americans who participated in the doolittle raid and were subsequently captured alive by the japanese were brutally murdered but some of the incidents allegedly taking place are unnecessarily absurd for instance the announcement that corregidor had fallen resulted in japanese officers in the courtroom slashing at each other with swords like a bunch of pre pubescent children and an american boxer actually defeated a judo expert sheer nonsense the movie centers on the concept that the japanese didn t know where the b s came from and the americans steady refusal to tell them in actuality the japanese were well aware of the approaching task force and its makeup one has to realize while watching that this movie was made when the mood in the country was gloomy japan had staged a wide blitz in the pacific and had smashed easily through all opposition we were frightened if you keep that in mind and can make allowances for the obvious misinformation the performances are good and the movie fun to watch 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
stick with original why american production make hk movies look so cheap first of all they cut off so much scene second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by english dubb always stick with original licensed hk release be careful with cheap imports boots and bulls though 
good movie for under i must say this isn t the best of ralph bakshi i bet the soundtrack would be worth more then the movie there is some great songs however there is no plot there is no reasoning and there is no action like always great animation by bakshi but i know for sure the bakshi s team could had really done better stars for the music stars for the film i wasn t upset for spending the dollars 
the cell phone is the main character the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone the movie is a nokia product placement highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and conversely what a phone can do for you if you have one the plot centers on jessica kim basinger who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need mystery what is it after lots of running driving in various parts of l a the bad guys round up jessica s family while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would be day spa owner cop are trying to help them mystery how will the cell phone save the day mystery watch for the credits at the end of the film they show up on a yep you got it 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
unbox video not yet working will not play once video was downloaded i get the error message can not play file please try again later error x i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed i was told the unbox saturday and sunday hours i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again feb 
not what i hoped for i m a big fan of colin firth and i was disappointed of this movie i felt sleep wish i never do on an average good movie i do not recommended if you ve seen bridget jones diaries not even close 
one of the sickest movies ever i wish i could give this movie zero stars it s really amazing how someone can inject raw gore violence and sick humour into a movie and try to pass it off as slick comedy drama and deep philosophy this movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie the sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism do yourself a favour and please don t ever watch this movie if it comes on air it s not even worth watching for morbid fascination i terribly resent the fact that i gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity but then i may actually be glad that i did at least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
how much is that demon in the window ohh no please mr corny demon thing don t hurt me ! this movie just seemed to really suck while it did scare me mainly because the only thing scary about this movie was the monster s growl then you see the monster and feel better it still stunk of usual smell of b rated monster flicks watching such flicks is almost a hobby of mine and i d have to say in a triple threat match among this monster whose name is forgotten or not even mentioned rawhead rex and grim from the similarly named film i d say rawhead would go all the way but going back to the movie it was pretty cheesey what with all the ho hum acting ho hum story and ho hum characters i advise you to stay away from this movie just ignore it and maybe it ll go away 
interesting all star british adaptation but dvd transfer is unwatchable this is a very interesting adaptation of alice in wonderland featuring a plethora of major british actors from the time this movie was made note that today s younger audience weened on an mtv diet of rapid cuts and incredible cgi may find this slow but if one can get beyond that it s most definitely worth a watch that said this dvd transfer is basically unwatchable it s not clear what source they used for the transfer but there are terrible audio pitch problems throughout the movie with wow and flutter horribly apparent this is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score if you have any sense of pitch you ll find yourself pulling your hair out listening to the off key strings ! the video quality is pretty horrible as well worse than standard cable a real travesty 
super teen having been a teenager once i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however in pump up the volume the movie s attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero well played by christian slater cannot communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he doesn t use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim he treats the caller as someone who isn t serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure but isn t he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry folks been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives as none of these teens do merely escalates the generational gap and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
kind of aimless i found this movie somewhat entertaining although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience nevertheless the film is about a whole host of young people dressed up and heading for a party ostensibly martha plimpton s party but they never quite make it there plimpton someone i never really cared for is actually rather funny in this role and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party and her idol elvis costello christina ricci and gaby hoffman are both quite funny courtney love paul rudd and janeane garofalo are also quite a trio overall this is light comedy nothing special but still worth the effort 
not entertaining first let me say that i am a composer and die hard musician i just watched this movie to learn what i could about this supposed genius and i could barely keep from turning it off actually i did turn it off quite unattractive really turns out beethoven was an insane jerk and his lifestlye was not intersting to me at all he may have been a great musician but that is not really the focus of this movie in fact there is no focus in this movie except that he was a jerk if you want to watch a great movie about a great man i suggest the the endurance enrest shackleton will make you want to punch people like this beethoven character it will blow you away 
why aren t zero stars available for rating maybe i should have known better but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same this is a four dollar movie in any department store 
hugely disappointing expecting sexy camp in the tradition of beyond valley of the dolls i was really looking forward to seeing this film instead i struggled through this tedious repetitive and confusing mess of a film i respect what the director was trying to create but the end product is nearly unwatchable it s starts out so well too i tried not to remember why i buried my trumpet but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo sadovampire ghost story that isn t the least bit sexy or interesting i know this film has a sizeable cult following it is pretty to look at sometimes when it isn t in grainy slow motion but i just couldn t make it through maybe it s worth a look but i personally wish i had rented it 
oh the humanity red water a made for television film starring lou diamond phillips and kristy swanson carries on the now long and wearisome tradition of ripping off jaws you would think that nearly thirty years after steven spielberg s project arrived in theaters filmmakers and producers might move on to another genre you would be wrong every year brings us even more animal gone wild flicks everything from sharks octopi whales snakes bears rats ants birds cats dogs dinosaurs crocodiles alligators and genetic laboratory experiments gone horribly awry ripping their way through a fresh crop of hapless humans if the creature in question has sharp teeth claws wings talons tentacles and pincers expect to see the monster in question appear in a low budget straight to video knockoff of jaws sure there are elaborations to the standard plot lines none of which significantly improves these rip offs but all of them owe a big debt to steven spielberg s film for example red water tries something a little different by having a freshwater shark terrorize people on a louisiana river it also inserts a plot thread about a gang of criminals recovering a stash of money from the riverbed none of these ideas disguises what is really going on red water is the story of john sanders lou diamond phillips a down on his luck fisherman with an ex wife horrific memories of a disaster from his days as an oil drilling technician and loans on his boat he can t afford to repay at the same time sanders dithers with the bank about his delinquent loan payments a shark somehow manages to enter the river and promptly wreaks havoc on swimmers fishermen and anyone else who manages to get in the way sanders could care less about the shark primarily because he doesn t know about it at first and also because his ex wife kelli kristy swanson just walked back into his life she s a scientist working for some big oil company that is drilling for natural gas on the river and she knows that john is an expert on this sort of thing whether you buy the idea that a scientist would go by the name kelli is another matter sanders eventually agrees to help out when he learns that the oil executives will pay him handsomely for his troubles after all he ll do just about anything to bring in enough cash to keep his boat what none of these people know is that they will run headlong into several sharks one that swims and several that walk around on two legs the movie switches focus long enough to tell us about some jamaican criminal who lost a ton of money in the river when one of his underlings dropped the box containing the cash in the water while eluding the authorities this guy hires some mercenary thug along with a goon named ice coolio to go track down the subordinate in an effort to persuade him to reveal the location of the cash and wouldn t you know it the site just happens to lie right near the oilrig where sanders and kelli eventually show up ! what follows is incredibly predictable the criminals take over sanders s vessel because they think these guys angling for the money a disaster occurs on the rig that claims the lives of several workers and the shark turns up to chow down on a few of the principals how predictable is red water not only is there a cajun chap helping out on sanders s boat we get a few scenes of a cajun party complete with music and dancing just in case you aren t aware that you should laugh at these hicks the script throws in a few lines comparing the party to deliverance how clever and original is that i m starting to get real tired of seeing this sort of prejudice in films and television shows if you put any minority group in the place of these cajuns and did the same thing the outcry would be deafening its not the overt prejudice of the cajun scenes that sinks red water it s everything else the venerable lou diamond phillips hasn t made a good film since welli can t recall actually i quit following his career after the first power as for kristy swanson i was surprised to see her here i remember her star rising in the early to mid s but at some point she fell off the radar and if red water is any indication into b movie purgatory it s sad really because she s not that bad of an actress coolio on the other hand goes over the top in his role as a thug looking for some money if i had known from the start that this guy was in the film i wouldn t have watched it aside from the performances or the lack thereof the production values are low the pace drags and the film has the propensity to put the strangest dialogue in its characters mouths i really really wish i had written down some of the odd lines uttered by phillips s character i remember watching the movie and thinking at the time i should write that down and use it later in a review for some reason i didn t probably because i just wanted this thing to end quickly in another bizarre turn the movie carries a r rating even though there isn t much bloody carnage going on the only extras on the disc fortunately are trailers for bats the big hit and ride or die if you re really interested in watching creatures attack flicks there are plenty of other bad movies to choose from most of them unintentionally hilarious schlockfests that manage to entertain on some level red water is too bland too confused plot wise and too full of actors on the downhill slide of their careers to be entertaining if you decide to head up this river good luck to you 
sucks unless you enjoy movies that are not funny not scary and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even sobaditsfunny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks !

no s hey lets put hugh grant on the cover and maybe people will buy it well i didnt buy it for hugh however i did buy it because fangoria holds it up pretty high my curiosity got the best of me and i wanted to know why they liked it so much i still wanna know ! the movie was plain boring ! the script introduces one annoying character after the next its a huge mess with bogus effects and a major lack of suspense or terror ! i wanted to find something good i may be able to say about this movie but the only thing that comes to mind is that atleast it ends obviously there are those that get it and those that dont i am proud to say i dont 
unimpressed i m shocked that having spent what was it million they couldn t have at least employeed a writer director who cared about the original medium comics and that pre existing fanbase i wouldn t be complaining but to base it off of the original films and then ignore so many gems that made the original films enjoyable simply left a lot to be desired i feel looking back that the writers simply wanted to reach non fans by writing a cuttingedge nontraditional superman story it wasn t necessary lastly while i love lex luthor i found it a shame they chose to keep the version of lex who is a real estate obsessed super villian who lacks forethought im beginning to think the heads of wb don t know of any other villians for supes to fight most shocking is that they signed the writer s up for a trilogy deal before this movie even hit theaters 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
amateurish rubbish this complete waste of minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone star movie with cringingly awful acting laughable special effects the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment appalling dubbed dialogue cheesy music inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere the grim reaper is a total disaster dont waste your money on this turkey 
valentine director jamie blankscast denise richards david broeanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw jessica cauffiel katherine heigl hedy burress fulvio cecere running time minutesrated r for strong horror violence some sexuality and language valentine the over slasherized version of the excellent tom savage suspense novel starts with a pre teen valentine disco set in a bespectacled young boy heads on the dance floor looking for a young female to share a dance with first he approaches shelly later played by katherine heigl who embarrassingly rebuffs him his charm doesn t seem to work with lilly jessica cauffer paige denise richards or kate marley shelton either they all send him packing quite arrogantly his luck changes when dorothy jessica capshaw actually acknowledges him and the twosome leave hand in hand they are later caught kissing under a bench by a gang of bullies in order to save her own self from persecution dorothy accuses the youngsters of attacking her and so the gang decides to take their own revenge they cover him in red gooey stuff carrie anyone strip him and chase him onto the dance floor where they proceed to beat him up fast forward ten years and the girls are now women no one is sure what happened to jeremy the bullied brat from earlier as he disappeared after that dance it s close to valentine s day of course and they each receive a card signed with a poetic threat to their lives they soon realize to take them seriously when shelly is found with her throat sliced before long a mysterious masked madman stalks each of them leaving kate and her boyfriend adam david boreanaz to work out that she s next on the psycho s list the acting is standard horror fare denise richards once again shows us her amazing and wide range acting talents those two large things attached to the front side of her body that we like to call breasts david boreanaz gives a fair performance but definitely shouldn t give up his day job on the wb s angel newcomer marley shelton can t do much with her underwritten role and she comes off as extremely annoying and whiny for the most part the rest of the acting is close to pitiful another problem with valentine is that the characters are all so self indulgent and morally extracted that it s almost impossibility for them to win over the audience in the beginning they re shown as mockers to any child that s unfortunate enough to be less pretty than their egotistical selves and actually possess a brain this discrimination continues throughout the movie as they brush off the men who are trying to woo them out on a date simply because they re not up to their high standards how can anyone want such pompously arrogant characters to survive in a typical slasher movie the final girl is usually the shy reclusive type that the audience feels sympathetic towards like laurie strode these characters have no such power leading you to believe that the world would be a better place without them anyway director jamie banks urban legend has proved that he has the potential to become a fair filmmaker however this is his first feature failure it s a shame that he couldn t have made more of the talented cast and competent budget but in the end valentine just feels empty a couple of talented cast members are not really enough to warrant the many obnoxious ones cupid certainly missed when he fired the arrow of fortune at this heart this one s destined to escape our memories in the not toodistant future

fellini s rome a commercial collection of stereotypes there is a lot of traffic in rome especially on the raccordo annulare where accidentsare also frequent the traffic is noisy and dirty especially when it rains romans swear when they drive and also when they don tthere are many american tourists in rome especially around the fountains in the piazzas where they cluster and sing american songs italian men hit on women tourists who resist their advances se vedi gente che lavora allora non e roma romans do not work no some of them do and in fact morning till night but rome is not what it used to be everybody knew each other and was polite while now everybody is rushed and rude besides the free love of today has substitutedthe brothels of yesterday yes some of the brothels were chic while others less so rome was bombed in the second world war in fact bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatricalperformance the public then proceeded to theshelter where flirting and lovemaking would ensue the roman aristocracy is close to the papal court they run parties together even fashion shows cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the popehow to rule the church and yes ! motoryclists can and do go around thecolosseum providing a tasteless final sequence one leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time does fellini really have nothing at all to sayabout the eternal city after all his years there nothing except thestandard collection of stereotypesabout italians stereotypes that occur in everyscurrilous joke that are met on the pages of every trashy guide it is true that there are a few nice sequences especiallythe often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes and then the great anna magnani appears for about seconds to tell fellini she won t talk to him that is perhaps also a scene worth watching but the rest is commercial cinema vai a dormi federico 
children lend me your ears children of the corn had some potential a corn cult for children with a charismatic adolescent as its leader takes over a rural town in nebraska based on a short story by stephen king this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept unfortunately some very weak execution is what mars the movie its director fritz kiersch sometimes works as alan smithee the pseudonym for directors who don t want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys this movie doesn t quite warrant that though it isn t very good either there is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening yet simply is not most egregious is the use of hokey faux sacred music aside from linda hamilton john franklin and robbie kiger the performances are pretty weak it doesn t help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful isaac chroner franklin instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town his advice nearly prevents vicky and burt stanton from seeking medical help there but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids if the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh the incredibly lame final scene certainly will that is not to say this movie is all bad however though never scary there are a few effective moments throughout i don t want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie die hard horror fans might want to check out this release though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear this anchor bay dvd is anamorphic widescreen with good picture and sound though this is not the director s cut 
from the desk of john dear quentin how are things going man i heard about the new film with uma sounds great did you see my newest film lucky numbers i play russ richards the local celebrity weatherman in harrisburg pennsylvania russ has adoring fans his own table and omelet at denny s and a snowmobile dealership due to uncommonly warm weather his dealership is about to go under crumbling his entire financial empire out of desperation he pays a visit to gig tim roth the owner of the local strip club gig suggests that russ and his friend crystal lisa kudrow rig the state lottery crystal works at the same station and pulls the numbers out for the lottery crystal is all for the idea she has also been dating dick simmons ed o neil the station manager and he has been neglecting her her share of the winnings will help her break free everything of course gets complicated funny huh it has it s moments quentin you know that i like to work with people i know it makes me feel comfortable acting is hard man i need comfort to help me create my characters nora ephron directed the film she and i worked together on michael which was pretty successful so i was hoping lightning would strike twice i really enjoyed reading the screenplay basically it combines elements of dark comedy and farce people act weird some people die people are mean to one another but they also act really silly i haven t done a lot of farce but i laughed when i read the screenplay my track record with comedy is spotty but if someone has the million and a decent script i m game lisa and i are great together she plays someone that is very different from her well known persona on friends crystal is very different from phoebe crystal has an edge a determination that makes her very interesting crystal has a few moments that also make her seem real a very important factor in a farce if the character doesn t have at least a tiny grounding in reality the farce doesn t work lisa gets this and makes it work i get it too and made it work during the scene in the denny s in the scene in the snow mobile dealership in the scene at the television studio when they reveal that someone was killed in the well i know i made it work somewhere i m no film historian but it works the supporting characters are top notch michael moore plays crystal s dimwitted cousin he is very funny tim roth is good but doesn t have a lot of laughs but that s ok he s primarily a dramatic actor anyway actors should play to their strengths michael rappaport plays a local thug he s all over the place hell most of the supporting cast is all over the place that s ok because this is a farce right i know reviewers will pick up on the fact that everyone in the film is greedy unlikable and they really don t like each other there isn t really anyone to care about that s ok these characters are based on real people they don t need to be likable they need to be funny they are funny aren t they sometimes yes they have some funny moments nora is a great director she has a good hand at comedy especially farce every farce i have ever seen has too many laughs you re laughing when another joke happens you can t keep track of it all thankfully nora has slowed everything down quite a bit her pacing is glacial but i like that i have the ability to laugh at the jokes quentin i m just not sure i ve had a string of dogs lately i m not a good actor i m a movie star i am a persona that draws people into the movies they shouldn t expect my performance to be subtle or even well modulated if i m playing a local celebrity weatherman i m going to play it for all the smarminess i can i m going to mug and grin at every character that recognizes me i m going to wear the local fame on my sleeve and when things start to go wrong i m going to shake rub my head run around in circles really frustrated i can play characters but lately people haven t been coming to the films battlefield earth was a disaster but to save face i told some news people that i thought it was good and will make a sequel i am a powerful star a member of the million dollar club i can t go back to the under million club i just can tquentin you are the king of creating comeback vehicles can you start thinking of another comeback vehicle for me i know you can i think that i may need another comeback in a year or two start watching the old videos ok pal for me quentin thanks buddy john

sucker punched boy do i feel like chump i bought this dvd based on the reviews here and because of it s overall star rating holy crap was i ever sucker punched in the back of the head by this wretched little pile olizard spittlei love cult films and i also love films that are so bad they are good etc and i guess that s the main reason why i fell for these reviews hook line stinker i could not even find it in my heart to finish this movie after about an hour i couldn t take it no more so back in the case and into the garbage disposal crunch crunch bye bye aaaarrrggghh one can only wait so long for something anything of interest to happen or be said please don t end up a chump like me and stay away from this one because i can assure you the people who wrote these great reviews are not going to get together take a collection and give you you re money back bitter you bet 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
the beginning of disappointment as a big fan of ralph i was looking forward to the end of the affair maybe my expectations were too high but this movie is dreadful ralph is a brilliant actor but not even his flawless acting can t compensate for the nonsensical plot and the horrific casting of julianne moore what happened to moore it is not hard to learn a british accent from the sounds of it moore didn t even try she sounds so american she fails to convince anyone she has an ounce of english in her and if that weren t bad enough the plot is as unconvincing as moore s accent she s an adulteress but miraculously heals a young boy s facial disfigurement and brings ralph back from the dead even the priest admires her adultery and all ! her husband does not know the meaning of jealously and lets ralph live in the house even though he knows of the affair still amidst the unbelievable the plot is so predicatable she coughs a few times here and there so we know before anyone in the movie figures it out that she s dying we also know why she quotendsquot the affair long before its quotrevealedquot to ralph and by the way what was with all the nudity totally unnecessary and vulgar 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
not as good as the film i am a great admirer of david suchet s poirot but i found this production disappointing despite being filmes in egypt with breathtaking scenery most of the touches of warmth and humour that make a christie novel such a pleasure to read are missing from this production the three young people in the love triangle that is the basis for the mystery all seemed to me entirely lacklustre the worst thing of all though is that two of the most charming and interesting people in the book timothy allerton and his delightful mother have had their characters grotesquely distorted until they bear virtually no resemblance to their originals and there is a quite gratuitous and disgusting implication of an incestuous relationship between them which is certainly not implied in any way in agatha christie s novel the girl who in the book timothy allerton loves has had her character changed and subdued until she barely makes any impact on the story at all all this makes this a very disappointing production the ustinov film is better 
terrible this was an awful movie i kept waiting for it to get better and then the credits started to roll i was hoping for something along the lines of crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers but this movie does not even compare instead it comes off as a cheap knock off of one of these great chinese movies the worst part about this movie is the visual effects it tries to emulate the effects of the two movies i listed above but it looks like it was done on a budget making it nearly unwatchable i am ashamed that i sat through this movie when i could have spent my time doing something that i would have enjoyed more like giving the cat a bath 
will denis leary ever figure out he can t act well the title kind of says it all dull uglyboring men in a dull ugly boring movie also the most unreallistic sexual pairing in the world stunningly beautiful elizabeth hurley with ugly skinny beaked nosed denis leary steve buscemi is comical as usual and adds the only bright spot to the film 
dull overexageration an even though it s fiction the incidents seem to fall out of the movies context to become contrived boring nonsence on a teen hormone kick 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
man oh man you talk about disappointed this is the icing on the cake all i hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was not even close whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong i love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such there are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the s but this is not one of them seriously don t buy this i don t know why it is so highly regarded the acting story and especially the music is el terrible it s like porn quality acting a story written in about minutes and music from a disney movie it could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy through in some disturbing music and made the bad guys well more bad it could be remade which i m usually against 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha 
once again a king story is ruined on film in the short story collection night shift mr king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least movies that i know of this mess trucks twice once by king as maximam overdrive and once as a t v movie night surf the boogyman not the new one graveyard shift the mangler and maybe more and not one has been done right ! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve he who walks behind the rows more like we steped in something behind the rows and we steped in this flameing piece of junk skip it 
my advice watch get shorty instead the problem with this film is i read the book i was disappointed simply because be cool is an obvious showcase for the musical talent the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would ve been more intersing if somebody would ve said hey don t forget the book but being true to the original source is not hollywood s strong suit be cool provides some popular music some known faces but without john travolta the movie would never have been made a few laughs are provided a couple ironic scenes show up but there s too little to sustain a full length feature basically the project is a disservice to everyone involved some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a clich the rock does the best he can but again hes a gay bodyguard he s the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji his boss vince vaughn who in the book is far more sinister but in the film he s an idiot of course chili is chili travolta does a very nice job and chili s obviously the smartest guy in the room uma thruman s performance is well not funny not serious not intense not much at best she made me shrug i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr but there s just not enough and all the negatives reflect completely on the director enough said there my advice watch get shorty again or read be cool 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
not what i expected this movie lacked the luster i expect from robert duvall it was an endless journey into boredom at least for me 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
no s hey lets put hugh grant on the cover and maybe people will buy it well i didnt buy it for hugh however i did buy it because fangoria holds it up pretty high my curiosity got the best of me and i wanted to know why they liked it so much i still wanna know ! the movie was plain boring ! the script introduces one annoying character after the next its a huge mess with bogus effects and a major lack of suspense or terror ! i wanted to find something good i may be able to say about this movie but the only thing that comes to mind is that atleast it ends obviously there are those that get it and those that dont i am proud to say i dont 
these guys made super troopers i disliked this movie almost as much i loved super troopers not sure if i would say it was awful but it came close 
the legend exceeds the reality i have always been an avid fan of westerns in general and charlton heston in particular but this is one of those movies where the legend surrounding it far exceeds the actual viewing even allowing for its having been butchered by the studioscharlton heston of course plays major dundee a man with a very forceful character resolute determined and even rebellious invading mexico and attacking the french army for such a man to later be found as a hopeless drunk wallowing in the gutters of durango is thoroughly incomprehensible the purpose of the invasion of mexico is to capture or destroy the apache indian charriba so one would expect the audience to watch the movie in anticipation of a great climax when the two sides finally meet when they do meet however the action is over in less than a minute and charriba is simply shot by michael anderson jnr so the climax is in my view an anti climaxwe are then presented with a new climax when dundee and his men have to defeat the french army in order to get back across the rio grande although this encounter is a lot more exciting than the one with the apaches the overall effect as far as i am concerned is rather like the effect one gets when reading a murder mystery to discover that the murderer is somebody who only entered in the final pages and the scene where a wounded richard harris single handedly takes on the other half of the french army is so unexpected in view of what has gone on before as to be virtually unbelieveable with regard to the movie having been heavily cut by the studios i would suggest that if any cuts had to be made they should have cut the durango scenes entirely plus all of the scenes featuring senta berger romance only slows down the action and adds nothing to the story whilst too much romance leads to boredom finally having watched the movie with the new score first and then with the original score i have to say that i preferred the original the movie opens with charriba saying to an upside down strung up soldier who are you going to send after me now the original then has the opening title major dundee accompanied by the mitch miller sing along gang singing the major dundee march to me this is a much more stirring and rousing score than the new replacement and sets the scene for what one hopes will be an exciting movie by all means buy this dvd as a piece of movie history and as part of either a charlton heston or sam peckinpah collection even though peckinpah disowned it but for my money don t expect a western anything like as great as the likes of the big country the magnificent seven or how the west was won 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
mother forgive me just awful slasher picture with not one hint of real talent behind it the first movie i ever walked out of and i was home the pits 
lacking of the facts don t let a propoganda wheel fool you of the truth the miami herald gained access to all florida ballots and did their own recount at their own time who won bush ! http wwwusatodaycomnewswashingtonfloridamainhtm there is a case that african american voters were turned away however where is the same case for the many haitan american voters who were also turned away in droves who are known to be sympathetic towards republican causesthe filmmakers had a chance to make a point about voter rights and election problems they turned this to an attack against president bush and republicans insteadsadly their message will only be heard by bush haters instead of the world because of their decisio 
no good scenes in the whole movie this movie doesn t have a single scene worth watching femalien is in another league don t waste your time on the sequel 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
could have been worse but not much warning spoilerswhat an awful adaptation the worst part was the music saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early s the only character that didn t bore me to sleep was robert hardy s general tilney i had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and i love jane austen movies usually i didn t even rent it i borrowed it from the library they should have paid me to take it i don t quite understand how catherine and henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another isabella and her brother were way overdone it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of jane austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good isn t this is probably on my list of the ten worst movies i ve seen 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
i just didn t get it this movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch i don t like that going back and forth and not knowing what they want from me and i really didn t get the ending i didn t buy the romance the only thing i enjoyed about this whole movie was kevin spacey that s it just skip through the rest of the crap 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
supercop the movie is ok but it is a superior film in cantonese the dubbed english is awkward and detracts from the film i find the quotdubbingquot very annoying and would prefer the vintage hong kong jackie chan films marketed in the us be provided in the original language argggh 
good but not great i guess i expected more out of this movie but i confess i was mildly disappointed in it at first the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling still it was a great cast dean martin was particularly adept at westerns much more so than frank sinatra who pretty much plays frank sinatra in this one it is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies in this case anita ekberg and ursula andress the bad guys are well represented by victor buono and charles bronson a fun movie but not particularly memorable 
mommie dearest home for the holidays every so often thomas bezucha s the family stone injects itself with a dose of reality about the modern liberal family that intellectual caustic progressive argumentative often matriarchal nuclear unit with imperfections not unlike the conservative family values crew selfishness materialism pettiness depression noise veiled cruelty toward the black sheep of the group which in this case is the one most interested in pleasing his parents but this movie is not really sincere about the realities of such a family it s serious about it all right but not sincere it is a christmas family mosaic where everybody gathers round the twelve seat dining table of a nine bedroom house for a seven course meal to assume their roles and pick on the prodigal son s new girlfriend it is also a button pushing shameless picture that insists we like that shrill pushy diane keaton persona more or less because her character is dying of cancer keaton plays one of those full of it moms falsely hip falsely sage constantly yelling and hugging and pitching fits and hogging the stage so accustomed is she to this domestic tyranny that when the girlfriend calls her on it we get a scene i couldn t quite believe back to that in a minute the family stone assembles a large cast for its tale keaton is sybil craig t nelson is husband kelly dermot mulroney is the parent pleaser everett luke wilson is the laid back ben ty giordano is the gay deaf thad and rachel mcadams slums just a little as mommy s academic daughter amy who sincerely yet inexplicably dislikes everett s straight laced fiance meredith sarah jessica parker as much she will eventually like meredith s sister julie claire danes who arrives midway through and enraptures everett who s years older she does this thing with her throat amy says of meredith s phlegm clearing tic meredith cannot relax and the stones idea of hospitality is to let their guest know how hospitable they could be if only she would make herself at home sybil and amy take their snarky turns on meredith sybil stares wistfully out the window awaiting the mid movie revelation that she s dying mulroney puts on his mulroney face think stallone in mild anguish while everett wrestles with it all kelly and ben eat marijuana brownies at the high school football field ben looks at meredith as if he d like to see if she loosens up drunk three potato chips if you ve guessed she loosens up drunk it leads to and falls away from that moment at the dinner table when ty s homosexuality is thrown around for some tired liberal humor ty and his boyfriend brian white intend to adopt children and meredith asks a sincere question of nature vs nurture which sybil bombastically turns into a mini skit on how she wished all her sons had been gay a plenty ignorant thing to say deliberately said for effect which meredith misses thus meredith s second question do you really mean that what bezucha writes next is fascinating if brutal and unfair the entire family dives into meredith it climaxes with sybil literally cursing the girl to hell while ty a saint by now mists at the notion that maybe he a deaf gay man has had a life he may not have wished on his brothers meredith is a stiff and suit sure but that the family stone actually brings her back into the fold after such a humiliation speaks of its intention to preach and convert of what hard to say that gays should adopt children that blowhards are better than the sincere because they re dying and judgmental in the right ways that all can be forgiven with fittingly an old photograph of the mother in her ninth month of pregnancy that we should worship at the altar of human imperfection that the movie is really a veiled tribute to the mother bezucha either had or wished for if so well i did not have and i do not wish 
wow with as many big names in this i thought it would be amazing well it is a corn ball adventure its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and poses shakes head its things like this that really hurt the film for many kung fu hong kong film fans i really wanted to like this film but couldn t get past the ridiculousness of it now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish 
kronos the ravager of worlds a lonely traveler is out in the dessert looks like the same place that many great sci fi movies were made in his s pickup when he spots a strange light meanwhile back at the laboratory an unusual meteor is being tracked on its way to earth what do they have in common the dr leslie gaskell jeff morrow suspects that there is some nefarious plot from outer space they could be right but can he prove it this movie is missing the front end dialog familiar with the classics of the era they just used the word kronos because they must have thought it sounded nifty like the giant this of course is misleading as it makes you think it has something to do with time there is a love interest between gaskell jeff morrow and vera hunter barbara lawrence a fun side interest was looking at al the fancy scientific equipment circa s concept the menacing device is hockey may have had too small of a budget 
not for the easily offended the squeamish or horse lovers this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film matresse or mistress in my opinion is one of the worst three films to be released on the criterion collection the only reason i watched and reviewed it is because it was released by criterion the film contains very explicit depictions of sadomasochistic activity some of which involve nailing body parts to blocks of wood there is also a graphic scene of a horse being slaughtered for meat as well as numerous scenes of people eating horsemeat that horse lovers may be highly offended by it got an x rating by the mpaa and was banned in many parts of the us the film is about a woman who secretly operates a sex dungeon in her basement when her apartment is broken into the burglar falls in love with her the only special feature on the dvd is an interview with the film s director barbet schroeder 
this is a comedy seriously i didn t even think that this was a comedy until i came here and saw people saying it wasn t funny i got it as part of a boxed set of cary grant films purchased here and it s the only dud of the lot there was one scene that i will grant you was light and entertaining not laugh out loud but funny enough i won t spoil it by saying which one aside from that the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity most of all you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne grant and simmons in particular are strong but their efforts are ultimately squandered bob mitchum is ok but generally miscast and kerr s beauty and talent are basically wasted no amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here she goes from happily married to tramp in about minutes for no discernible reason overall acting c grantsimmons b directing fwriting d i understand that this film caters more to english tastes and that s fine but i found it most un satisfying 
duped is the word believe it or not we watched this movie from beginning to end just to see if there s any redeeming feature what a waste of time ! we ve enjoyed all sorts of movies from the serious to the ridiculous but this movie is totally pointless pointless doesn t even begin to describe it what a cheap piece of if you have any appreciation for the art of movie making for a good story for good acting for provocative ideas for a good laugh or even for the sheer entertainment value of the ridiculous don t spend any money on it and please if you have seen it add your cents here so that fewer people get duped 
poor jayne what a waste the las vegas hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars jayne mansfield mamie van buren and ferlin huskey it appears to be a low budget film due to the photography acting and settings if you are a jayne or mamie fan you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only one highlight of the film is ferlin husky s dream sequence of jayne singing that makes it air time of jayne is very small trivia the siamese cat in the film which jayne is holding belonged to jayne s friend may mann 
land of oprahisms having avoided seeing this film i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on brought tuesdayunbiden into our home my aversion to oprah and her ilk does not cloud my dislike of this film a bad film is a bad film devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned and directionless directing this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward something should occur my interest should be engaged this film takes reams of pre packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses and attempts to build the plot from words alone it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said heythis book is full of words lets make a movie in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting to be honest jack lemmon was not very good in this film he played the same character he always did just older hank azaria was just awful he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones and was wooden and expressionless maybe he was too embarrased to be there as to the other actor s well they filled up the space nicely the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was they even covered the green leaves on the trees some better acting some good r rated dialogue and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film as it stands however it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr phil etc the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases a good cry and a genial talk show presenter will somehow make it all better ifor one think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial then pull the finger out and just get on with it to the grammar and form police i did have this in paragraphs but the editing process scrunched it all together sorry 
stars ! this is not the worst gore film eva made but not as good as expected lamberto bava s demons just doesn t quite live up to the classic status of the original the quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part lets just admit it now get it out of the way the gore is pretty much the only reason to watch these kind of cult films ! demons lacks the ripping tearing of flesh limb that made the original demons such a fun classic instead replaces it with alot of guewy slimey stuff a very stupid demon puppet ! while not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations especially considering the two maestro s who held the reins argento bava 
disconnected film couldn t even get through the whole film i must have watched a different film than the below reviewers i couldn t even get to the end it seemed so disconnected when you have to read the jacket cover to figure out what is going on something is really wrong maybe you have to be a professor to understand this movie but i found it worthless 
prisoners of the mountains i thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular it kept me awake but just on the verge the few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie i thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best overall i was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star 
too bad i ll have to forego the many reviews i have read of the merchant of venice make me thirst nearly unbearably to purchase this dvd however i cannot for it offers no english subtitles which i need to get the most out of a movie especially shakespeare whose language is difficult enough to begin with i have much ado about nothing which i adore which does have subtitles will look for others 
very disappointing the movie is vulgar and not meant for children it is a typical adam sandler movie with foul language and raunchy humor not enjoyable at all 
outlaw all post release editing this is truly one the most spectacular films ever made not suffering for having been made during the silent era however as correctly stated by another review of the film the dvd version runs to mins as oppossed to the vhs mins this is not due to dvd faster frame rate but rather because the dvd version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason at one point the hero fairbanks has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose tree the next minute he is seen explaining to her in an intimate scene that he is not what he seems having seen the vhs a number of times i can confirm that the dvd version has been brutally cut do not buy the dvd version as it is a let down with those scenes missing thus the reason for my one star which would otherwise have been stars with the rimsky korsakov soundtrack you have been warned 
great acting but unbelievable story line this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting especially the girls playing christy and ariel is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but couldn t he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but can t find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i can t imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter s eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed 
plot holes the first half hour of this minute movie is actually quite good in fact it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don t know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates she was however but we the audience don t know that however the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam is unexplained especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin however it turns out she isn t so that s why the movie lasts longer than minutes fortunately we re not dealing with unwanted pregnancies either so this doesn t turn into a soap opera however we do have the dreamboat hero who dreams up the rumor about her being raped and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that s true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film dreamboat takes the turn as lead character and it s his story we re following whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film and basically it s her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out dreamboat and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out and everyone else in a way the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth though the characters don t have the same truth in mind it s about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it s not the comic book variety isn t fun for an audience it s just distasteful in other words the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first half hour and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved it might be worth viewing if only once but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that s the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip or in this case deliberate lies is that what goes around comes around and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first min then quit midway but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once just to be sure where this is headed 
jason goes to hell i bought most the friday the th dvds around halloween time at a discount of course i couldn t find this one even thought it was at wal mart for a long time before that in my opinion this one wasn t very good at all compared to all the rest i was greatly disappointed it was just so fake and not realistic at all very cheesy for those who wish to complete the set this one is part of it this one was so awful and far from the other ones so fake it s shameful bad script it jumped the shark jason yes that s my real name 
boring i know that this film is supposed to be a masterpiece but i fail to see how anyone can interpret this film that way i was surprised to see jeff bridges is such a boring film i found that this film wandered too much in the beginning i watched the first hour and noted that there was hardly any character or plot development ! i found that the movie never really amounted to anything i believe that this movie is not even worth renting ! if someone can explain to me how they could interpret this movie as an excellent one please feel free to e mail me with an explaination otherwise my feelings towards this movie will stay the same addy joekerrthejoker hotmailco

read the book instead just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children movies have ratings for a reason this movie is rated pg which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children in this case it is crude humor what i don t understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience shouldn t see it 
the recording was very bad the play itself was good but the quality of video and sound was very bad all through the dvd the sound quality near the end of play was too bad with irregular flattering in sound and video or intermittend drop out of sound 
no need to suicide i get the story line but grown women need to suicide the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself it is not matching the character 
lame two problems first problem let s say you re the typical kidnapper rapistkiller for fun and out of postmodern boredom you kidnap two girls off the street in new york city what are the odds that your randomly chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives or miles away one in ten million twenty million second problem the movie even with a run time of an otherwise short minutes doesn t have enough action or development to fill the void in short it s boring and in several scenes where craven seems more interested in the bucolic wechester county scenery than moving the plot along i found myself reaching for the fast forward 
wish they d make a better version i am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year i show the movie and this is a terrible version they leave out almost the whole story and change the rest it is such a great book and i think they could have done a better job on the video i am always hoping a newer and better version is made 
this one will put you to sleep this was a big disappointment not worth it 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
this sequel is not so bad it is only unnecessary what it this disney s original animated film the jungle book was made in and after almost years they released a sequel the jungle book what is the point of doing this anyway to be fair the sequel is not a horrible film it has more colors more light colors in the jungle and comes with the original s exhilarating bare necessities who can dislike this song and the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done letting us into the world of the wild child mowgli and his friends but after that about minutes or so the film suddenly starts to look not soambitious attempt to re tell the story of the original which should have been ended years ago in this sequel mowgli who is fed up with the rules of the village goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone now baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number but we are not so happy that is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film s conclusion and partly because we know the same story has just begun again the difference between the version and this one is that shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy ranjan but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable after all the problem is not the fact that the story of the jungle book in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made years ago the real drawback is that in jb nothing interesting happens except the last minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill mowgli the film provides musical scenes which are decent themselves but they only stretch the thin story even though i love the song bare necessities i don t want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs minutes to me i am living in japan the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so so film return to neverland the jungle book was originally made for video and then was chosen for theatrical release in usa and uk that they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company s choice of the material for the sequel 
really really bad movie one of the worst movies i ve seen man there s no way to describe this movie slow boring unidimensional bad plot really bad acting really low budget in a bad way im not gonna get my time or my money back i bought it based on the reviews and they were really off even if you enjoy the gothic ambience believe me it s really bad youve been warned 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
my name is george hen how adorable this film is john lithgow is brilliant i love the scene when he is throwing all the mcdonalds hamburgers at the beast catch of the day ! this movie means something to john his name is john lith his name is john lith i wonder if johns little babie son ever acted again hahaha 
no information no pictures the film shows no action except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body and you ask yourself in what relation to the subject of the film this stands sorry forgot the secondsceen of a naked young man just the head of yearold lads who wonder why they got infected when they work as prostitute explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in prag like advertising you are provided with not the least background information about their education why they left their home town why they have no normal job i would wonder what politics think and do about the youth in the new ec country what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school and what other chances they have in life

sex shouldn t be boring two moderately decent looking white people who apparently aren t very good at sex go at it in this movie if that s your thing why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it at least then you won t have to listen to the cornball pseudo artistic dialogue in this film what a crock they could at least have cast a fine young sista like rosario dawson or gabrielle union to make this movie moan and squeal ! this movie makes sex seem boring 
looks like a routine television program i am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent as for me i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay the fault in order of importance poor screenplay poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino who seems to be vying for the most over thetop performance the film was absurd in many ways from the outset the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans close up after close up conveying no meaning pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his not sofamous european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops first example they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that then instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling police you re under arrest they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source of course pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog stumbling around further pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from we must assume his quarry did the screen writer forget that pacino s colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit too inevitably and apparently not because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him as i watched this scene unfold i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already that pacino has fired on and killed his partner it was then that i decided that i had had enough by the way the european version with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior don t waste your money or on line rental queue on this hollywood drivel ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time the recruit which i could only stand for about a half hour too 
alice in wonderland so i saw this one live action alice in wonderland movie and it sucked but i m confused this isn t the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie i think it is i m not sure if i want to risk boring myself with other crap so will i watch this verison ever who knows 
bad director bad god this movie was lame i mean it was lame it limped it struggled it staggered i lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes the really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gonna get killed check the sleazeball guy getting killed check the sleazeball guy practically begging for death here doggie that s eighty minutes of my life i ll never get back 
alice in wonderland so i saw this one live action alice in wonderland movie and it sucked but i m confused this isn t the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie i think it is i m not sure if i want to risk boring myself with other crap so will i watch this verison ever who knows 
not great i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie this movie is contrived the character that reeve plays acts like a star struck groupie personally i don t find his behavior to be romantic he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him this is not romantic to most women nowadays he is not suave in the role he is playing it seems like a cheesy s contrived romance that does a bad job of it 
worst movie ever i purchased this movie based upon the reviews and recommendations from others on amazon com who i assumed had watched it and liked it not knowing the titles or directors of good erotica i based my decision on those comments i have to say and i m usually not one to go off griping about things that don t deliver on their advertised qualities but this was by far and without a doubt the worst movie of any category i have ever seen i considered selling it on e bay just to recover some of the cost but i refuse to subject any poor unsuspecting man or woman to this garbage if you re looking for something to set the mood this movie will not do it 
the incrowd is out susan ward coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward then give this a movie a try if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future don t find it here 
the worst vampires movie is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects 
the firm great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd 
not bad but this in an uninspired telling of a transparent political fable good enough to watch once 
horrid movie i can t believe how disappointed i am in this anime i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad but it s not the little girl annoyed me so much i just can t stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie can t stop ranting yeah for those who haven t seen it you might like it like everybody seems to but i would not recommend it at al 
the creator of m ash wrote this i was surprised to see larry gelbart wrote the screenplay of this unfunny movie i can recall very few laughs in this film the premise of the film is to highlight the greed of the s but the lesson is quite dated in the era of enron and worldcom the greed here is apparent and at least honest and upfront in contrast to the dishonesty and deception of some of the greed of the late s as for the message i certainly don t think the shareholders of rjr reynolds minded being courted so well if i were a shareholder of a slumping company i d be mighty grateful to live in a society where people have the freedom to pay whatever crazy price they want for my stock ! james garner is wonderful in this show and the movie does a nice job of laying out the business concepts in terms your grandmother can understand i do have to confess however to dozing a bit in the middle of this movie so perhaps i missed the funny parts 
attack of the totally fake and unconvincing sharks how many modern day jaws rip offs do there need to be well ! okay this film i would rank lower than stars if it wasn t for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist the other reason was i think casper van dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him but this movie stunk in no ways does it compare to jaws nor even deep blue sea i hated almost every moment of it if you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy deep blue sea or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years don t be fooled this is a waste of time and effort this film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
oh the pain the pain of it all mortal kombat annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters odd considering that in interviews after the first movie all of them said they d want be willing to come back for a sequel to the horrible even by standards cg effects to the cliched fight scenes geetwo women in a mud pit i bet it took them all night to come up with that one virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat video game and set immediately after the first movie which while not great looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan played by brian thompson the alien bounty hunter from the x files and his army shown in most scenes as a small band of extras oooh scary as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity with only a week to do anything about it lord raiden played by james remar replacing the and i can t believe i m saying this much better christopher lambert in the role once again enlists the help of liu kang robin shou sonia blade sandra hess and princess kitana talisa soto along with help from a select few other characters from the video games crowded lineup to prevent this from happening the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad however given the film s obviously low budget the weak screenplay the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film and most jarringly direction even more inept than that of paul w s anderson it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high only to have practically everything come crashing down the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie as well as music by kmfdm megadeth rammstein juno reactor and others if ever you re looking to punish yourself for something then by all means watch this movie however if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself you will avoid this movie like the plague believe me you ll thank yourself later 
extremely biased film portrays strikers as angels i love how this movie portrays the striking coal miners and their wives as innocent angels while the scabs are called gun thugs who just open fire on innocently peaceful protesters with machine guns the film maker spends of the film with the strikers and doesn t try too hard to get the opinions of the scabs and mining company workers after all scabs are people who do the work that the miners do not want to do themselves the work has to be done anyway the mining company in this film not only gave its employees wages but also housed all of them too of course the wages and housing conditions are lousy but housing employees is not an employer s job any sane person or anyone who has seen a major strike in person finds it hard to believe that the scabs are the sole instigators during strikes and that the strikers are the pure victims scabs are just trying to go to work and support their families too but are violently harassed by strikers who can do the same work but choose not to if the work is good enough for the scabs then why isn t it good enough for the strikers strikers also use more than just words to taunt scabs they use sticks clubs and occasionally guns or knives to hurt scabs whom they believe are taking their jobs away from them in this film when the scabs defend themselves for the right to go into work without getting hurt or killed by the hot tempered strikers it is the scabs who are always portrayed as the gun thugs and evil while the strikers are always seen being saint like perfectly behaved and unjustly discriminated against why else are police officers on the scene of most major strikes to protect the strikers hell no they are there to protect the scabs who are trying to go into work but are subjected to constant harassment by the strikers this film even has the token black striker who happens to get along with all of the white striker folks but guess who uses the nword in this movie toward a black person you guessed it an evil scab i wonder if this film would have shown the strikers reaction to a black scab if there was one probably not bottom line if you are pro union and believe scabs are the scum of the earth and that strikers can do no wrong then harlan county u sa is the movie for you 
where is the salsa so i bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing well anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing awesome good or ok has never actually seen salsa dancing ! i am a salsa dancer and this movie was horrible i have seen amazing dancing and good dancing this was terrible dancing ! and there was hardly any salsa it was s dancing to salsa music ! that s it the only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner other than that it was just s dancing to salsa music that s it if you want to see salsa dancing i definitely do not recommend this movie if you want to see horrible acting and old s dancing then i recommend this movie there was only one thing that i liked about this movie the appearances made by tito puente and celia cruz that was great to see but not worth buying the movie for oh and the story line what was it again yeahi love movies good ones and bad ones but this one the worst movie i have seen so far to the best of my knowledge there aren t actually any movies with really good salsa dancing hopefully someday there will be 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
not good but what other choice do you have first of all i would like to start off by saying that this movie sucks here are a few of the things that supports my decision dacascos does not know capoeira he played the berimbau an insrument used in capoeira wrong he pronouced many of the terms incorrectly and he had no flow to his movements the acting was horrible while watching this you kind of get the picture that the director wanted to finish this movie a soon as possible most of the lines were just stupid dacascos character had no real history apparently had this mysterious past you really could care less about because the plot was so predictable the fighting was laughable at best capoeira is the only martial art that was outlawed for being so violent and unstoppable you don t need corny fight scenes to show it s usefulness most of the fight scenes where repeated movements that were shot at different angles dacascos was doing meia lua s a spinning kick in which both hands are on the ground as you strike that were knocking out three people at once in one ridiculous scene saverio the drug lord pointed to where he wanted dacascos to stand so that he could miraculously appear behind him and perform and unchallenged jumping kick to the back of his head i wish an experinced capoeirista would have done the fight scenes although this movie was horrible it is the only movie in which capoeira is suppose to be the main artform used while watching this movie one can only hope that this poor performance dosen t hurt capoeira s chances at being the cornerstone of another movie 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it

wellman adaptation lacks suspense after watching the fabulous bonus features on this dvd a biography of william wild bill wellman with observations by robert mitchum and tab hunter another bio of track author walter van tilburg clark a look at actual mountain lions and their habitat and more i realized i held a minority opinion of the film itself compared to many of the reviewers you ll read here i think it is stagy lacks the sense of dread and palpable suspense of the novel and doesn t hold up as well as most of the director s work a tale of a dysfunctional family at it s boiling point and the impact a nearly primordial panther has in changing their lives the characters with the exception of always watchable robert mitchum as the domineering middle son are all either boring frustratingly indecisive or downright unlikable oldest son william hopper best known as paul drake in television s perry mason is the dreamer who bonds with the environment but lacks the instinctive power to defeat the cat and never comes across as more than wishy washy bitter spinster sister teresa wright offers a one note portrayal that soon becomes grating youngest son tab hunter is so wimpy that you quickly lose interest in him philip tonge the loquacious alcoholic father whose drinking problem in the novel is tragic here becomes a stereotyped comic drunk with hidden bottles of liquor providing comic relief diana lynn as hunter s girl tries hard but never seems more than a minor character in the proceedings even legendary beulah bondi as the greedy bible spouting mean spirited mother seems to simply channel her bad mom portrayal from the what if sequence of its a wonderful life worst of all ex little rascal carl alfalfa switzer encased in phony looking old age make up to pass as a yearold ranch hand medicine man looks neither believable or comfortable in the role with a farm set that looks patently artificial and obviously on a sound stage the outdoor scenes shot at mount rainier must take up the slack sadly despite the creativity in using high contrasts to make the colors achieve a black and white look the book s greatest asset the constant frightening unseen presence of the malevolent cat was to me never achieved despite a mitchum monologue as he gradually succumbs to helpless fear in fact hunter s final confrontation with the cat is handled so routinely that you can t understand what all the fuss was about the film was a big letdown ! 
a disgrace to the film industry in simple words easy rider is probably the most morally detestable film i have ever seen my impression of hippies before seeing this movie was that they were more or less just lazy but peaceful people now hippies kinda disturb me in the beginning of the film when they stopped for some food at the commune it was clear that the director wanted me to sympathize with the hippies i personally however could not have felt anymore different there were kids running around everywhere not being watched while adults irresponsibly thought only of themselves wether that meant engaging in immoral behavior such as taking a swim naked or doing drugs the odd thing is though that while drugs are never exactly glamorized though done frequently by the heros of this swimming naked is treated as if were innocent children s play that seriously grossed me out how could something so lustful and dirty be thought of like that hippies are just plain creepy also its kind of hard to get around thae main characters these guys were nothing more than no good drug smuggling degenerates and yet they are the sad excuse the movie has in the place of heros the director or one of the cast members i believe on the making of easy rider compared the two main characters to john wayne but if john wayne ever played a hero as lowesome as these one s the movie would just simple not be any fun another problem in this movie was the south they were potrayed as nothing but lowesome biggots their hatred for the hippies unrealistically comes out of no where now i ll admit there are people like this but to generalize the entire south is unfair ultimately though i would have to say the worse part of this movie was where they had lsd trip and the apostles creed a catholic prayer was being recited as strong practing catholic this could not have been more offensive i had to leave the room after about half way through the scene it disturbed me so much i returned once it was over though frankly i wish i had never seen it in the first place everything from this scene represents what i hate about society the hatred for religion expressed is not very peaceful or loving long story short this movie is about as immoral as they come ps i dont think i can ever look at my steppenwolf cds or records in the same way again 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
i know fred twoo the personality of a nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance fred leuchter was painted as such by many people some who knew him and i m guessing knew better and as we may be witnessing others who didn t brownshirts insult assault rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas maybe a major lesson of the holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to so long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas there must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist so that they may prove their allegiance to the group maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent as dissent does not equal disloyalty except in a nazi state there was a great free press in germany in nazi times so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries mr death is not representation of fred leuchter fred leuchter is representation of fred leuchter might i suggest not suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary that s not clarification that s reinforcement of one idea rather go and find fred and speak to him get his view if you don t have a preformed agenda like van pelt or morris you may get him to respond like i did i found a different fred and a much much different story than i was given by director morris and others the question is not whether german gas chambers were used to murder people the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that or any other idea that is without having his house firebombed a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place have his reputation ruined or any of the other stuff happen if fred s ordeal is any indication the brownshirts are alive and well but i don t think fred is one of them the one fact i would alter in my previous post is rabbi bauer s support for no gas chambers bauer supported fred s methods not necessarily his conclusion i tried in vain to contact bauer on where he differs with fred fred has high regard for rabbi bauer the polish forensic investigation which came soon after fred s did not come to the same conclusion as fred but did essentially duplicate fred s data collection methods and results there was testimony at the nuremburg trials by both inmates and german staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in germany in physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there it took years for simon weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those german concentration camps a former inmate at auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there but all this isn t to say that the auschwitz gassings didn t occur but rather to simply say that some may think they didn t occur and for that they shouldn t be condemned unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like fred 
beneath the glotz the story or rather the spirit beneath the schlocky presentation of solarbabies is rather wonderful it must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism the kids are not following a glowing ball they are following an ideal a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it the water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment most of us have lost sight of that sphere of light it s unfortunate that even the movie s director did not understand these meanings nor did the producers nor the more famous and over paid of the two writers consequently they all worked too hard to create another b science fiction movie this movie could have been a classic 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
widescreen or hd blueray i have to say i love this movie very well done but after all these years of it s release why has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on hd or blueray or a new disc dvd set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie 
not good just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i m a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging 
the itsy bitsy problem by the time you see the ending you ll already be wishing that you hadn t watched this movie 
read the book my first viewing of fahrenheit since its initial release in was last night via dvd any casual film fan who watches will fall to sleep very fast based on the novel by ray bradbury the clever idea of the future sets the stage for an interesting movie the vehicle that the unit drives is one of the most unusual devices science fiction will ever see the plot the sound and the characters are all completely uninteresting minus montag whom oskar werner plays very well the moment with the lady with the hidden library was probably one of the silliest examples of what books meant to some fahrenheit may be considered a classic to some but without a remake quick this is a boring artifact to science fiction theater in the future the government outlaws books and promotes people to do nothing but watch tv and take drugs miserable firefighter montag set for a promotion in the book burning unit takes up the suggestion from a fellow monorail passenger to read a book his life then goes upside down from there skip the movie and read the book instead 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
chairman william shatner be afraid ! be very afraid between and a popular television show in japan called iron chef ryori no tetsujin pitted its acclaimed one of its professional chefs against a challenging chef each week using a particular theme ingredient in all of the dishes made the show was hosted by the flamboyant chairman kaga takeshi kaga who opened each show presented the challenger unveiled the theme ingredient and gave a brief synopsis before the winning chef was declared the show gained popularity in syndication in the u s on the food network using a mixture of dubbed english and subtitles due to the rising popularity of the show from cable subscribers the upn tv network decided to broadcast an american version of the show in that was produced by the larry thompson organization and lions gate television of canada unfortunately these two companies failed to effectively reproduce the elements of the japanese show that had made it so popular instead they created a poorly written directed substitute that was akin to watching a wwf wrestling match not a challenge between two professional chefs the first mistake that the larry thompson organization and lions gate television made was in their selection of the new chairman for iron chef usa though i very much enjoy william shatner in his roles as captain kirk in the original star trek tv series t j hooker in the show of the same name and his more recent role as an attorney in boston legal his attempt at being chairman of iron chef usa was far too farcical and clownish to be taken seriously in trying to replicate takeshi kaga s flamboyance from the original japanese tv series their next mistake was in the commentaries during each of the original japanese iron chef shows a group of commentators which included a culinary expert would explain what each chef was doing as well as analyze the possible dish outcomes the iron chef usa commentators treated the two chefs as if they were athletes and would even send in an annoying field reporter sissy biggers to ask them stupid question while they were busily preparing their meals their other major mistake was their selection of judges most of the japanese iron chef shows included an actual food critic as one of the judges as well as japanese actors actresses sports personalities who were quite articulate in their critiques of the prepared meals but the iron chef usa judges were inarticulate and inexperienced not surprisingly and quite thankfully only two episodes of iron chef usa starring william shatner were ever produced and were entitled iron chef usa showdown in las vegas and iron chef usa holiday showdown each of these shows on the dvd i rate with a well deserved out of stars for being poor mockeries of the much more entertaining original japanese version in the food network s produced its own version entitled iron chef america battle of the masters that included two of the beloved original japanese iron chefs hiroyuki sakai and masaharu morimoto and was hosted by takeshi kaga s nephew mark dacascos it was a far better show than the ill fated iron chef usa if you are considering purchase of the iron chef usa dvd you do so at your own risk 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet

john travolta and samuel l jackson again so the first thing you need to know about this movie is that it sucks it really does i m not sure who their military consultant was but if samuel l has specialist pins on his collars you don t call him sargeant women aren t allowed in the rangers nunez not my rules ladies colonel styles looks a little young to be a colonel even for the army the army doesn t issue tiger stripe bdu s mueller the list goes on and on this may not seem that important but if you re gonna make a movie about the army you could at least get some very basic soory could t resist things correct yes it s true that there are many twists and turns in this plot but all that really means at least in this case is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay hey if we tell the same story a couple different ways it makes the story really interesting right not so much oh and that scene where specialist west is standing on top of that shack with his pancho blowing like a villains cape wow who decided that was a good idea i don t want to ruin the ending for you because there s no point in even seeing this movie and anyone with enough brain cells to operate the remote will figure out the finale long before it makes its belated arrival by the way how do you follow someone in an army humvee w out them knowing seriously please spend these or minutes talking with your kid s reading a book excercising writing a review i dunno something worthy of your precious time you ve been warned by the way connie nielsen looks hot w short red hair 
loaded deck shoots blanks considering the sensational cast eli wallach terrence hill bud spencer kevin mccarthy and brock peters the euro western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot ace high is a major disappointment the plot is uninvolving and incoherent the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever the editing looks like it was performed with a butcher s knife after the first ten minutes i knew i d made a mistake buying it a boring minute piece of junk ace high is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great italian westerns including corbucci s the mercenary or parolini s sabata series save your fistful of dollars for a better film 
i don t know i ve watched this film about times i don t really know what it s about i should go out buy a copy and watch it about more times the story starts off with a expedition into a jungle in search of an old relic it ends with a finding of a greater one in between there s a blur i think i m going to buy it that s all 
my disc was defective too and the movie wasn t worth it i actually bought this dvd over a year ago but just decided to watch it i m a huge fan of sidney lumet and i like richard gere gene hackman and the other stars in the film about mins into the movie the picture started distorting and after that it would skip large chunks of the movie there was nothing visibly wrong with the dvd itself but i saw enough even before i reached the defective part it was like watching a foreign film without subtitles i had almost no clue what was going on and didn t really care after a while i can usually watch almost anything most movies have some redeeming quality for example maybe an exotic interesting locale this is largely set in new mexico no offense to new mexicans but skip this i threw it away 
not pride of the yankees starring tony perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer what can you say the red sox have jimmy pirsall tony perkins and fear strikes out the yankees have lou gehrig gary cooper and pride of the yankees 
disappointing my friend has a minor talking role in this so i downloaded it to see my friend and because i admire some of de palma s past work the film displayed plenty of talent in all areas except script i lost interest by the halfway point and watched through the end only because of my personal connection plot resolution was implausible even if it s based on fact characters fell apart 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
disappointing i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline well they needn t have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday i liked both of the main actors jessica lange and ed harris the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing

skip this one get the original over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original classic film directed by zoltan korda even those scenes can t disguise the remake s network tv movie quality beau bridges is generally a good actor but he is terribly miscast on this film go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself 
revolting prelude i hate this film and the ballad of cable hoge because of its depiction of animal cruelty this happens just at the prelude of both films 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
great movie released by wrong company i have the vhs tape of this movie amp will continue to own it while this goodtimes version of this great movie is on the shelf i have not watched this movie for the fact that goodtimes will screw up a good movie with bad quality picture sound amp all around basics the movie itself is great to watch with weller amp elliott in the action scenes amp the story is just all in your face the only problem is this movie was not released by mca home video if it had been you would have a great movie on dvd instead of this blurred amp muffled sound version 
poor reproduction of great movies this is an extremely disappointing copy of great original movies looks as if it was duplicated on poor dvd equipment from old used vhs tapes no wonder it s hard to find out who made this i wouldn t want to take credit for it either hard to enjoy in this poor format my delivery took place in february 
thumbs way down oh did this one stink convoluted and confusing the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless i didn t laugh once 
truth stretching and all out fabrication i saw this movie as a kid when it came out and liked it but since then it has gone through something of a critical reevaluation goodman is an entertaining actor but there are just too many factual errors and they arguably detract too much from the film s quality as was noted elsewhere by other reviewers goodman s ruth does not represent a great athlete ruth was not overweight growing up nor in his early days as a ballplayer ruth s weight did fluctuate but few to this day know that ruth had career stolen bases and actually led the yankees in steals one year goodman s character was unreasonably slow and at the end was portrayed as unable to run the bases even on a home run this might work as light humor but it certainly is not fact also of note goodman was a natural born right hander that had to learn how to bat and throw left handed like ruth for the purpose of acting in this film this makes goodman look awkward and even less like an athlete on a few occasions on the other hand i understand as a general rule that playwrights and filmmakers are given a certain artistic license and that it is alright on some occasions to stretch the truth for a purpose the bloated portrayal of ruth might be one such example no matter how erroneous it is from a factual standpoint even so many of the inaccuracies have no discernable purpose case in point jumpin joe dugan was never a teammate of ruth s in boston only in new york it is also known that ruth did not have any home runs in but according to this movie he had one that year in addition ruth was not the first player to hit a home run at forbes field the list could go on for a while and there seems to be no reason why the filmmakers decided to alter such facts jumpin joe may have been put in there just to have a veteran teammate friend for ruth but dugan started his career three years after ruth did so he could not have been a veteran to ruth at any point in his career they could have picked someone else to fill this fictitious veteran teammate role or scrapped the idea all together the home run served the purpose of providing a dramatic rookie year home run but this scene could have been set in instead and with some modifications perhaps could have been just as dramatic lastly regarding forbes field the announcer could have said a true statement along the lines of forbes field is a pitchers ballpark not many home runs are hit here folks as opposed to the inaccurate no one has ever hit a ball out of forbes field the latter line had a dramatic effect but was not necessary also of note ruth s supposed meeting with gangster alphonse capone seemed a bit absurd perhaps this was thrown in to get a glimpse of the times aside from the dicey misrepresentations though there were a few strong qualities the acting was strong overall with ruth s two wives giving strong performances and goodman s performance was not a total wash even if there was too much over thetop buffoonery and let it be said that this film does have the ability to evoke some of the excitement of the game of baseball a sentiment especially felt as an eight or nine year old viewer but as said by derek armstrong there were too few ambitions toward a greatness to match that of its subject matter 
ehhh so so it s a so so film with rourke in the ira some good stuff look for anthony stewart head as rupert note anthony stewart head portraits another rupert rupert giles on the tv show buffy the vampire slayer so now you know but this one is so so like i sai 
poor quality i m not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot it s redundant and unnecessary and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that s based on and well my gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it s original format onto dvd was bad the soundtrack is about to second off from the video part of film therefore the voices don t sync up with the lip movement 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
lover s lane another horrible wannabe slasher movie to add to the pile lover s lane another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible lover s lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and years later some relatives of the people who were murdered up there always is are tormented in the present but the hook man from the urban legend pretty much a snoozer with bad acting who calls this acting good how many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies it only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie the plot twists and turns arent even that great idiotic writing starring riley smith radio legged freaks erin j dean lolita a pig s tale suzanne bouchard joyful partaking sarah lancaster four kings dr vegas diedre kilgore good luck the falls billy o sullivan a change of heart rites matt reidy hit and run carried away and anna faris scary movie just friends in one of her earlier movies nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff its ridiculous 
power i can t rate it because i received discs from amazon and bth of them jammed on me i would luv to see this movie beware if your considering ordering it 
my house in umbria dvd would not play dvd stuck and would not go forward 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
dreadful dull disappointing i didn t care for this version at all i thought there was no chemistry between the two leads and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions the story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional brief story of thwarted love the character development especially of jane was missing in action no heartbreak no horror no sense of jane s virtue tough interior and self reliance which helped her overcome so many of life s obstacles not even much atmospheric scenery this mr rochester played by the usually excellent ciaran hines is utterly forgettable weak and miscast he doesnt have to be handsome but he does have to be powerful passionate sexy and seething after all he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy instead try the timothy dalton version which is excellent though now a little low budget looking or the even sexier and faster paced version with toby stevens and ruth wilson which is outstanding and the best yet it moves right along and yet it keeps all the story essentials 
punisher and friends i feel they should have called this movie punisher and friends yes i loved how they had the punisher move into his new apartment and make friends with his quirky and lovable neighbors he even joined them for dinner but still remembered to keep a frown on his face hes still hell bent on vengeance you see it was also great how the villains were able to do battle with him by simply driving to his apartment how convenient but what truly made this movie legend was the deeply moving dramatic performances of rebecca romijn especially that scene where she is attempting to portray an actress crying near the end of the movie i love when i feel embarrassed for an actor when they are attempting to perform and the popsicle torture gag was simply delightful winkwinknudgenudge you silly punisher even though your life has been senselessly destroyed you still know how to play a good practical joke i was so excited to see this movie but i was simply orgasmic when i realized how much they had watered the story down and turned it into punisher lite 
cult classic please a waste of my childhood i actually saw this movie when i was and it freaked me out abit but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world dont even rent this i dont even know why you are considering the film i only give it a star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
not for most people i cannot imagine an audience for this movie it is flat disjointed with poor production qualities it smacks of a film trying to be really artsy but it fails miserably if you enjoy confusion and disjointedness this is the movie for you otherwise keep looking 
aaron kwok gives a great performance in this silly cop movie kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever he looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good unfortunately his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad i won t explain the story it is cops vs drug dealers there is a beautiful fighting female good car chases big name stars and good fights how did this movie go wrong well stanley tong is a decent director but he is a stuntman screen fighter and martial arts choreographer at heart he tries to make this an american movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies i cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film i have seen in a long time usually i am able to get past all of this since i am a sucker for good fight scenes and this movie does have a few highlights to watch for are ken lo vs marc dacoscos and dacoscos vs everyone in the final fight the thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie cradle to the grave has a better end fight ! stanley tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale coolio ends up as the main opponent not ken lo who is the leg fighter that faces jackie chan at the end of drunken master and not marc dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors but coolio i honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie but the final fight sequence is just horrible stanley tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight it is just too bad coolio had to ruin it dvd from dimension home video has good sound and picture quality no special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie 
unable to review unable to see the movie received the original shipment and later a replacement and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
goodtimes dvd bad picture quality after reading a couple of other reviews about the quotqualityquot of transfer on this dvd i decided i wanted this in my collection what i thought would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality i was very dissapointed the quality of transfer of the picture is horrible a great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality non anamorphic deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered picture tones are very very bad along with what little color that is desplayed almost a black amp white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv it still was so dark it almost wasn t worth continue watching the only things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and quotsuppossedlyquot in dolby digital ex the beginning dolby intoduction was deffinatly in dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn t distributeand dolby sounds that i could make out on my theatre sound system sounded like mono to me thsi dvd reproduction stinks and i suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this quotgoodtimes video quot version untill it is put on dvd correctly why they botherd is beyond me because i wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen i am taping it on to vhs for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow i suppsoe i ll have to be content that i got the widscreen version on vhs for now untill they re release it on dvd with better quality or they show it on tv in widescreen which i highly doubt heck even taping it off tv you d get a better picture quality than this dvd 
one of the worsts the movie title itself says a lot the movie itself is a total scam fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing script and performance you d better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie

most boring movie i have ever seen i finally decided to purchase this movie considering i was told by one person it was symbolic and by another it was truely disgusting however i found it to be very slow and boring which made want to go to sleep making it difficult for me to actually catch any of this great symbolism i heard about as far as the digusting goes i didn t find it that disgusting compared to some movies i have seen it isn t very explicit in the violence so there is not any gore to it and they aren t very innovative with the torture compared to some movies i have seen the movie consists of alot of monotonous sodomy and an old lady telling stories of her sexual exploits while her friend plays the piano these parts were rather torturous to sit through because they were the most boring in the film and she told quite a few stories if you want to see something shocking i would not look here and if you are looking for symbolism i wouldn t look here because it is difficult to stay awake unless you like watching a bunch of naked people walking around groping one another 
movie is top dvd is a flop this dvd gets only stars because the tv screen format of this dvd production is really ridiculous but the movie is one of my favorites number on my all time best movies list the feel of the movie is more like that of a typical s sci fi movie like andromeda than of a s movie austere and unemotional like colossus himself quietly and punctuously narrated minimalistically acted and with minimal action a movie for the brain as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world i like the outdated look of the technology in the movie black andgreen screens led displays printout terminals etc really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the s and captures then reasonable appearing fears of computers surpassing human beings attention ! spoiler ! the movie has no happy end the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end just as it is in d f jones novel colossus on which the movie is based and that s another reason why i like the movie so much one of the few movies without a forseeable and boring happy ending the absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending by the way contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer this movie almost has the quality of a kubrick 
let s make this short and sweet this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought ok i didn t see the whole thing it might have gotten better so i ll give it another chance bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what that s about as boring as this movie so why the star markup cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the rings and i do like viggo i did not however like this movie it s kind of fitting it should be set in a desert cause that s exactly where this movie should be buried never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap watch hidalgo you ll be out in no time

why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
i ll be there but not for long there s a reason why they talk about the voice of an angel it s because charlotte church certainly doesn t have the acting presence of one her acting debut ill be there is proof enough only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres where it rapidly dropped out of sight rightly so seventeen years ago paul kerr craig ferguson of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert fast forward to the present kerr discovers that unknown to him his ex rebecca jemma redgrave gave birth to a daughter olivia charlotte church who is now a well adjusted paper girl the problem is olivia has been kept a secret from her dad rebecca is embittered but kerr wants to get to know his daughter and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel voiced girl and the burned out rocker together but rebecca doesn t want her child to follow in her father s footsteps ill be there was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler who despite being only in her twenties has had an immensely interesting life well maybe someday she will get a biopic because ill be there is only similar in one way it involves a rock star and his daughter otherwise it is boring in about every way that tyler s life is interesting with a forgettable script not much humor and a goofy premise the movie doesn t have a lot going for it it reads like a disgruntled teenager s absurdist fantasy scripted for church to act out and not a terribly interesting teenager either it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest it s an obvious ploy to show off church s vocal skills the best that can be said of church s performance is that at times she looks sweet as for acting talent she is bland at best but she does perform some good songs and her voice is as pretty as ever just watch the songs and fast forward her actual scenes redgrave does as good a job as she can and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker his is the only memorable role in the film and it s a shame that the movie didn t focus on him rather than the dull miss church miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film also known as the britney spears approach ill be there but i promise i ll get out as soon as i can 
give your fast forward a work out let s just be honest this film is terrible and not in the way that attack of the killer tomatoes is so terrible that it s great more like the way caddyshack ii is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame i was a kid when this film was released and while it was not particularly exciting then it is insanely tedious now it is a genuine test of patience but with no pay off what soeverheres some potentially helpful information the slasher film can branch in two directions supernatural friday the th ii halloween nightmare on elm street etc and crime revenge i spit on your grave friday the th tcm scream urban legend ect this one falls under the latter heading and while realism can render a more potent effect this could really happen ! this film simply fails to engage the viewer on any level the goal of a slasher film is two fold to horrify and repulse this does neither the horror element is non existent there is no point in expounding since there is nothing to examine and if you love gore and who doesn t try another film the murders are barely visible literally and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn many of the film s problems are technical the cinematography is just horrendous the entirely film is extremely underlit the colors are needlessly washed out and the film stock is grade f and this as you know is not because the film is over twenty five years old the problem was always there there is one good moment in the entire film when the school s bad boy has his head lopped off and it clumsily thunks down the prom court walk way still it is more comic relief than genuine horror the soundtrack could not be worse i am not referring to the disco tunes we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period but the tracks made for the film they sound like they were squeaked out by the carpenters so imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster psuedo thoughtful ballads like the final song on the track words cannot explain how wildly offensive it is ! did i mention that leslie nielson has a meaty role yes that leslie nielsen from airplane and naked gun he plays a tough minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter i know it sounds funny but it s not trust me ! if you dig watching unattractive teenagers disco the night away hey this film is totally for you but if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle period of its reign look elsewhere like halloween friday the th etc id be willing to get all ed mcmahon s star search on you and give this film a star but it is an important milestone in the slasher sub genre i will not spoil the film and tell you why though so if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar watch it on picture inpicture maybe after a few drinks on a day when the cable is out on fast forward 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
absolute rubbish this is by far the worst dance movie i have ever watched the characters acting and plot lines are laughable even for someone who usually loves cheesy dance movies and what little dancing there is in the film is badly filmed and boring if it hadn t been for the hilarious s outfits and hairdos especially the curly mullet sported by the lead character i would have turned it off if you like salsa watch dance with me 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
virtual snooze i bought it because i had heard it was a good flick ! well after watching it i gave it to my brother save your money 
not very good but it gets one star for the brief moments that ricky jay has in the film and another for portions of alec baldwin s performance overall this is a stinker mamet is not a good director he should stick to writing 
unbox video not yet working will not play once video was downloaded i get the error message can not play file please try again later error x i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed i was told the unbox saturday and sunday hours i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again feb 
a poor man s dick i m sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i m sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst or that level of indefatigable cuteness just go rent dick instead you ll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country 
just about what i expected only more boring i m sorry i love gina gershon and i was looking forward to watching this movie since i do like action films but this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick i wasn t even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show the basis of this movie the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an aryan militia becomes prominent nearby it starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate and the white boys in the militia don t like that gasp i never would have guessed main character kicks everyone s behind gets the girl acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any b flick action film your time could be better spent watching paint dry or if you re desperate for something like this then watch universal soldier at least it was funny 
painful to watch another product of hollywood s karaoke culture in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind we have in u an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war we get a cheap flag waving pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors and absurd scenarios an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit put this ridiculous movie in its own category u is just another thin over promoted throw away movie you ll forget the day after you see it 
ah i spent to much to rent this i was expecting this movie to be great considering this was the guy from brotherhood of the wolf what a disappointment i fast forward through alot but still couldn t bring myself to finish watching it the plot is slow and the actions sequences look like a tv shows 
this is a true vision of history it s about time someone stands up and says red scare is all about mean politicans and innocents writers soviet spies never existed that movie is telling us just that by completely ignoring the spionage problem and the corea war one thing is particularly shocking let s think of the millions of the victims of the gulag when we see stalin s poster in streisand s room freedom of speech will never exist in this country says redford pollack i just wish you were born in ussr you criminal 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
mediocre is good i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn t like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
was this movie made for the lifetime channel if lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them this movie was not scary it would have been suspenseful if i cared for any of the characters you know what the best part was when it was over few movies compel me to write reviews good or bad this one obviously did 
okay but could ve been better this movie was kind of disapointing to me i thought it could ve been a lot funnier than it was the performance of britnay murphy was okay she could ve been better the performance of dakota fanning was ecxellent it was so good she s a good child actress one of the best i ve ever seen the story of the movie was okay it was slow and boring thats why i didn t like it plot molly murphy is a daughter of a dead rock star who is living of his fortune one day her accountant runs away with the money and there is only one thing she can do and have never done get a job this would bee a new experince for her she becomes a nanny of a spoild brat named ray fanning who thinks the whole world is a germ infested place there is only one thing diffrent between the two molly is and acts like a kid ray is and acts like an adult can ray show molly how to become an adult if you liked this movie check out the soundtrack 
very disappointing i didn t have high expectations for this movie yet it still managed to completely disappoint me i adore robin williams and his performance was the best part of the movie but the script was abysmal and sara played by marcia gay harden was a completely one dimensional character the antics of the sidekick robot and the flubber itself were just plain embarrasing to watch too bad because the idea is great but frankly the original was pretty bad too they really could have done so much with this story either the first or the second time around 
i bought my dvd copy from amazon i love sophia loren as an actress however this dvd as movies in one package is a very very very poor quality dvd colors are bad picture is bad and the sound is even worse don t waste your money my dvd copy was bought from amazon this is my advic 
mediocre mystery movie even though i own most of the poirot offerings starring david suchet owing to my affinity for agatha christie s work i still maintain that peter ustinov is by far more at home in poirots shoes as evident by his inimitable performences as the belgian eccentric sleuth over the years particularly in the death on the nile and having said that the latest addition to a es poirot caper of the same name featuring suchet is unfortunately toothles and meandering at best in short if you already own the original ustinov versionthen don t even bother spending your hard earned on this trite 
good supporting cast lead man is lost other reviewers who detail the silly political correctness and faux politics are right this is clancy fordummies ford s jack ryan was sometimes a step behind but in a believable way the audience was right beside ryan and when he put and together and took action boy did he take action ben affleck s jack ryan is terminally lost pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive or at least interesting this is going to go down as the star wars prequel of clancy movies the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love 
what i kept watching this hoping a plot would eventually come up but it didnt 
for die hard kutcher fans only the movie starts off very slowly with childhood episodes from ashton kutcher s character it s at least an hour before we see the adult kutcher although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene the premise is good and it has some good momentum in the middle which is why i gave it two stars the shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done but the overall story line is very weak and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story also the movie has too many tongue incheek references to kutcher s real life circumstances such as the reference to tightywhities they distract from the story and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle which is too bad if you are not a kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie skip this one 
very boring the plot to this movie or so called sequal is horrible i rented this movie expecting something good and i end up falling asleep i actually had to watch it several times just to find out what really happened don t even buy it it is a waist of your money 
corny predictable blah don t bother with this unfunny predictable boring pedestrian fingerpainted drivel the piggy stole the show 
davy crockett tv vs davy crockett movies i was very gung ho when i found out that disney was finally releasing the davy crockett tv show on dvd i grew up watching the two davy crockett movies however upon actually seeing these dvds i was very disappointed it is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes the episodes davy crockett indian fighter davy crockett goes to congress and davy crockett at the alamo are all the parts included in the movie davy crockett king of the wild frontier the episodes davy crockett s keelboat race davy crockett and the river pirates were what made up the movie davy crockett and the river pirates i for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in that is just the two movies on one disc the only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy leonard maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector s box the biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between whereas you can buy the two movies on dvd for i myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately 
the most boring movie ever this is what happens when you buy movies that amazon recommends i consider my extreme boredom with this movie my punishment for letting them recommend a movie for me to buy don t let the fantastic cast lure you this movie is boring true it is realistic in the sense that conversations among friends more often than not don t necessarily go anywhere and oftentimes the texture of a movie is not in the conversations themselves but in the relationships that become evident within those conversations but nevertheless do not waste your money on this movie did i mention that it was boring 
no stars movie a director who has no idea how to film dance sequences an important song transmuted into god knows what mis casting galore a female star without one iota of chrisma if she stopped shows cold they must have been high school productions this is or should have been about the struggle to not only get a job on broadway but to hang on to that which is starting to fade the all important role of shiela seems little more than an after thought turned into a silly love story which doesn t even play it is merely sad sad and very very bad the one star rating is because i had to rate it ! 
top or top worst ones one of the worst films ever absurd the whole story in adition tring to be an important deeply movie just pathetic don t even try to rent it don t even try to talk about it the sex scenes are awful too nothing to save nothing to see nothing really a full horrible experience 
out of the pick up artist is a dangerously bad film there is absolutely no chemistry between robert downey and molly ringwald molly ringwald may have been of the most iconic s female actresses and she certainly proves her worth here ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character wasn t supposed to be that marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element the real joke in this film has to be robert downey his acting is insanely moronic i often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick i am pretty sure robert downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to from the start to the end i was annoyed i couldn t see how dennis hopper and danny aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it harvey keitel gives a fair performance but i believe he is much tougher than that comparing harvey keitel s performance in bad lieutenant reservoir dogs and mean streets to the pick up artist it is enough to make an apparent observation that harvey keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this a smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was rising sun and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film why did they have to call it the pick up artist could they give the movie a better title such as the player

what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
vulgar and disgusting saw this one on television vincent van gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy the artist who portrays him does his job very well the scenery is breathtaking however the nudity in the film is vulgar the chaeracters are hard to identify with some of the scenes are disgusting not going to see this one again 
almost unwatchable sci fi turkey this blatently derivative hat tip to ridley scott s alien with a hint of stanley donen s saturn thrown in movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over use of strobe lighting ever this makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is presumably employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills throw in a ridiculously precocious ship s computer and a downright silly robot and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space james spader and angela bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull the quothappy ever after quot finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness supernova s only redeeming factor is that it is very short 
hard to find dvd this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who doesn t have a problem with heavy british accents if you do try it with captions it was fun funny and a nice pick meup when one needs a lift 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
jazzman a very deplorable highly offensive insensitive profane and depressing piece of garbage the dialogue is jaw dropping embarrassing and so horrible you want to coveryour ears also very pretentious and unrealistic justwhat kind of people enjoy watching crap like this theonly positive thing i ever got from this film was thesoundtrack by gato barbieri the great jazz saxophonist i wanted to smack the s out of that wimp french boy friend of schneider s brando s not much of a man in thiseither an artsy fartsy work for the new york la filmschool crowd i suppose give me cool hand luke thankyou 
fun family movie the movie is fine but there is no mention in the description that this is a widescreen format i use full screen when i contacted amazon to find if it was available in full screen the response was send it back if you don t want it i kept it but was not happy with customer service 
you re better off reading the book the book is amazing this movie adaptation is quite poor although the actress who plays o is quite beautiful and there are some fairly erotic scenes this movie is deeply flawed and i can t recommend it the plotline gets totally garbled especially toward the end to the point where it runs entirely contrary to the book s intention on several key philosophical and psychological points second the actor who plays stephen is absolutely one of the worst casting choices i ve ever seen doesn t fit the role one bit so please read the book if you ve already read the book and love it it is probably worth your while to eventually see this film but expect to be disappointed 
a lot of green light and not much else rule number one if you re making a stephen king movie especially if it s a tv movie make it scary or don t make it at all ! the tommyknockers fails to do this miserably ! for most of the film you re watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions granted that s all in the book but it written chillingly by king in a way only he can do it there are some exciting alien moments at the end but by then it s too late you ve just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an x files episode on the plus side i had no problem watching the infamous traci lords act like like a total slut ! bless her 
confused i like japanese films and really wanted to like this one however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day if that is true i might give it a higher rating as of now however there are just a lot of things that don t make sense 
aims low and hits its target this straight tovideos modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison this prison only seems to house about inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it s resolved in much too pat a fashion however leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around and there s a torture scene modeled on the one in lethal weapon in which he s hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks mr thomas performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
gobbledygook self righteousness pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie there is a certain new fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash but at least that was somewhat assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream motion picture of is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long hours and as much as i usually enjoy george clooney i might never forgive him for this drek 
worst movie i ve ever seen i would have given this film stars if possible this film was long boring and painful to watch if you like jane austen films or other bbc period films do not be deceived by this one it is nothing like those types of films 
the lisbon suicides therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages and cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood s boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room on the second floor of a two story house and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon s neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run ofthemill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she s not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip s request knowing nothing but trip s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick of course but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
just horrible this movie was awful the main reason was it is just too unrealistic you have angels played by people like scatman crothers and charles durning as well as the devil played by the now later oliver reed coiming into the middle of the scenes and fast forwarding and freezingjust not realistic at all plus you have travolta as an inventor edible sunglasses yes i know not all movies have to be realistic but this movie just goes too far i watched it because grease was such a great movie but this movie just is pathetic even compared to an average movie let alone grease on the bright side however the theme song twist of fate is one of the best songs of all time and the video is equally awesome i think i may have just bought the movie to hear the theme song 
stupid movie this movie suck first the comedy is not even funny they ll do anything to make you laugh the acting is horrible the fight scene suck none of these actor know how to fight princess phoenix is the most annoying person in the world avoid this movie at all cost

it scared me too years ago i just read doug s review of first man into space and i just had to write respond i was seven years old when i saw this movie as i recall though my recollection here may be faulty it was double billed with tom thumb one of my good friends had a birthday party and we all went to the movies first man into space scared the bejeezus out of us we were so scared we couldn t stop crying they had to take us out of the movie in the middle sometime after the car was pulled over by the state trooper i thus never saw its conclusion a few years ago i found the video of the movie and i triumphantly brought it home to show to my teenagers needless to say they made fun of me throughout the movie dad you were scared by this 
a disaster this film has many many interesting ideas in it i think it has an original cast of characters i admire brian depalma for making his own brand of films unfortunately femme fatale is one of those films that will do anything to twist the plot in an alternate direction disorienting the audience and supposedly giving the film depth alas you need a strong plot in order to do this see memento effectively what s worse other than the major twists the biggest of which is just goofy there are way way way too many coincidences and visual gags which just pollute things further depalma has had this problem with many of his films one that comes to ming is obsession twists work best when there are maybe such as in dressed to kill the set pieces themselves do not approach his best work and stamos is unendearing almost irritatingly vulgar and nasty at times in order to be a femme fatale she should be able to work both sides flawlessly 
the nadir of many a career movie dvd quality dvd extras dont be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members in dreams is without doubt the career low for director screenwriter neil jordan as well as actors annette bening aidan quinn stephen rea and even robert downey jr whos made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career the film aspires to be a psychological mystery suspensethriller in the vein of psycho and the silence of the lambs but is completely undone by a cut andpaste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters uninspired direction shallow performances choppy editing and a grossly ineffective musical score only one scene in the movie is played convincingly and that s the one in which annette bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie unfortunately that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile in terms of technical quality the dvd presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable picture quality is clear and sharp the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers i was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that i didn t stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question the dvd extras are so so thumbnail cast and crew biographies that mention much better movies several lackluster screens filled with production notes and finally the theatrical trailer which is probably the best thing on the disc because it s short and features quick flashes of the film s visual highlights in dreams is not recommended viewing even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value 
wonderful exhilarating psychoanalytic comedy peter sellers as well as peter o toole and all the beautiful women capucine romy schneider etc make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the s was really that world that mad of course ! you couldn t stand life without a psychonalist thus the film reflects precisey that the lack of self confidence the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade till happy ending of course o toole and schneider get married and lived happily everafter and everybody has surpassed their personal crises good for the movie the humour is just wonderful i recommend it most enthusiasticall 
floozy boozy jessica gets her golden boy jessica lange won an oscar for this proof positive that some years are so bereft of strong performances they have to give it to somebody apart from that this is a silly exercise in anti government paranoia with a wasted tommy lee jones and not much else 
disappointing i ve been a timothy dalton fan ever since i saw jane eyre but this movie is difficult to take even for the most devoted please do not waste your money 
in good company is not good company in good company goes on and on at the end a little bit and the ending especially is not fulfilling character plotwise if it had ended minutes before it actually did i would give it three stars instead of two i admit there were quite a few times when i laughed a bit to myself but it didn t make me fall off the couch or anything there were other times when i thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced overall it isn t an entirely bad movie but like i said the ending is unfulfilling overall not strong performances coming from scarlett johansson or topher grace 
just say no this movie is no heathers it s not even mean girls as hard as it tried to be witty shocking dark and satirical it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop maybe i m just too old for this drivel although i could watch clueless and the craft until my dvd player breaks but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push i just didn t get it the movie wasn t funny which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses carol kane couldn t even elicit a smile out of me the plot was full of holes and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived i wasn t expecting greatness when i watched jawbreakers but i was at least hoping for hours of mindless entertainment unfortunately the entertainment piece was dropped and i was just left with mindless 
not what i had in mind let s get one thing straight i loved bionicle legos and when i first heard of this movie i was hyped up to buy it but when i saw it i was really disappointed let s see how this movie is voicesthe voices are really cheesy they don t fit the bionicles at all i d rather have no voices than any plotokay they totally missed out on the original bionicles they only focussed on the second bionicle design which is ugly the musici have not much to say but this music was freaky overallthis movie would of gotten a one star if the plot was bad nothing relating to the stories in the magazines or website however the plot was okay following a bit at the comics and websites so this somewhat a ok movie just be warned 
batman the movie review but this for my kids and it was the most boring movie i have ever watched the shows are more entertaining to watch then the movie 
the silence of the dummies this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! fats the dummy steals lots of the scenes the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act burgess meredith is great as the manager one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see fats but during some of the more romantic scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush dont miss the extras where they talk with the real vent that worked with them on the movie if you like movies that are a bit outside this is a must have for any collection pete cavan 
where dvd i m going nuts here i might be in a slightly foul mood on account of my having just returned from a shopping experience which resulted in my receiving a parking ticket but i used to watch kb s hamlet on a fairly regular basis whether is was on cable or vhs i found i could never get enough i signed the petition i m one of those people who s written letters in the hopes they ll actually make a difference that said where is the frikkin dvd i mean has anybody else noticed that kb s hamlet has already missed the dvd boat while the world is moving toward hd dvd we still have yet to see a sign of the stupid thing i haven t owned a vcr since back before amazon even really existed or was at least widely known i was an early adopter of dvd now years later years after the first time i inquired about this release i still can t believe it isn t out reality check people forbidden planet fine movie though it may have been and in context of this discussion as beneath its sci fi exterior one can find an interesting retelling of the tempest it s gone from film decades before i was born to vhs beta to dvd and now to hd dvdwhy is it that a film like forbidden frikkin planet gets pushed up through the years and transferred over and over again to the latest medium when the finest version of hamlet ever produced for the screen has been left behind whats going on is kb being held at gunpoint by mel gibson s handlers is there blackmail involved did kb contract george lucas to add a bunch of cgi ewoks to each scene cause i can t figure out for the life of me why we haven t seen this stupid thing yet was it that hard to commit it to vhs it seems to me that it was readily and easily done so what s the deal with dvd is the money just not good enough mr branagh i realize that your talents lie in theater rather than finances but of zero is zero it makes me wonder then is it some artistic issue when transferred to the higher fidelity formats of dvd and hd dvd are there imperfections present that were undetectable when the film was out in vhs format can we see more clearly how charleton heston s weird teeth have yellowed and browned over the years and formed into this strange rolling dental pattern greatly in need of modern dentistry my dentist could set those teeth painlessly over a four month period without the use of orthodontics for years i ve wondered about this college came and went i ve moved to three different continents my own career has gone from peon to mr importantpants and yet we are still without even a dvd version of hamlet yes i realize there s a version of the film available for digitital download but please don t make me any more uppity than i already am i want the film and i want it in its full glory with proper aspect ratio and preferably on hd dvd so i can see it in all its glory which would be especially nice considering the mm film used to record this sucker i hate to give what is easily the best film version of hamlet ever produced and no this point is not open to argument it s not an opinion but rather a scientifically proven fact one star but given that the man and his peeps have had over a decade to get the job done i think it s really just about time to see it hitting store shelves if it is hitting shelves by the by i apologize for the rant but i m tired of waiting i want to see this movie on a disc before i die widescreenpreferably hd i don t care about the bonus materials you can keep em if thats what s taking so long but just get some dummy college intern to do the transfer and throw together a dvd menu if it can be done for forbidden planet then it can be done for hamlet i have spoken and i am awesome 
firefly excellent but buy it on dvd not unbox read the unbox terms of use carefully before choosing this route over a regular dvd purchase it is not your usual set of blah blah legal jargon for example c removal of software if you uninstall or otherwise remove the software your ability to view all digital content you have downloaded to the authorized device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all digital content from that authorized device without notice to you if you ever remove the unbox software amazon may revoke your ability to view the firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine amazon i ve ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience why did you let unbox create these anti customer terms of use 
what a waste betty s voice is still strong and beautiful but arrangements of most beloved songs are simply horrible if you prefer traditional versions this concert is not for you the quality of image and sound is very good can be recommended only to hardcore fans 
don t buy this version don t make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic italian movie its a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images i can t beleive they put this one on the market youll get to see the three sketches all right but the transfer is simply amateurish and insulting no subtitles not even the original italian track no gallery of photos etc this is the worst dvd i ever bought luckily for others a new version was released in which has the proper treatment i just hope that visconti s last movie the innocent won t fall in this category when they released it someday let us pray for the preservation of laura antonelli s beauty 
there is something wrong with you if you enjoy this this is a horrible movie with no redeeming value i realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this let me bring something to you attention this is a slasher movie with effective gore in fact for the time the gore was more sick that similar movies however there are no scares no suspense no clever script no story and it has a stupic ending i know that applies to most gore movies the problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women i am a man a foot pound big strong guy that also raises a family the story which has a guy killing women b c of mistreatment from his mother seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film the murders in this movie are so mean spirited yet with no cinematic value that a normal movie goer would have to be offended this movie is not sick in a good movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner this is a woman bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage a movie should have an entertainment value there is no cinematic artistic touch on this film this is simply a mean mean movie ! 
bruce campbell fan i love bruce campbell s work even have the whole brisco county jr set but this movie was a big disappointment 
sentimental and fake having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i can t fathom the entire plot is self serving shallow and unrealistic i guess it s supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i don t condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who don t get it and it doesn t mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the writer director gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you can t keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it s not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that wouldn t bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself 
not quite as good as plan from outer space sadly this movie doesn t qualify in any category not even worst sci fi movie of all time at least plan contained scenes to make you laugh this movie just makes you cringe from start to finish it combines bad plot with wooden dialog bad acting tired direction and an overall story line that is riddled with cringe making errors and stupidities this is the kind of movie stoned teenage drop outs would make if someone was foolish enough to give them the resources even the title is flat my own party game dreamed up in order to survive the movie which my children wanted to watch until they too gave up in disgust was to invent better titles referencing older sci fi classics my favorite the day the bowel movement stood still runner up clueless encounters of the turd kind in short avoid this movie unless you want to know up close how it must feel to have an aneurism 
michael moore is an idiot this was a ridiculous documentary i watched with an open mind and after it was finished i was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view it was ridiculous being that it is a michael moore movie i should have expected this but i tried to view it openly let me warn you now don t waste hours or dollars 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
i want your brain this is not a george a romero project directed and written by ken wiederman film contains profane language gross bloody effects thom matthews returns as a different character joey james karen returns as a different character ed jonathan terry returns as glover allan trautman returns as tarman brian peck returns as different zombies pussface thriller jaw eyepop and the zombie on the car roof a truck that is traveling across a bridge is carrying pressurized cases that contain cadavers one case falls off the truck and ends up in the water a group of kids find the case and triggers the gas inside that spreads across the cemetary the living dead return also in the cast thor van lingen dana ashbrook mitch pileggi dvd only contains audio commentary and theatrical trailer 
please do not watch this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life if you are expecting another classic like anchorman watch another movie i was terribly dissapointed with will ferrell do not watch this movie 
recycled but nominally workable throwback i can t really bring myself to either like or dislike this movie entirely another entry in the future troopers genre it uses science fiction to explore the notion of a fierce unstoppable but ultimately disposable form of combat soldier examples of this notion have ranged from the excellent blade runner robocop and the terminator to the awful universal soldiers this one s okay on first viewing it reminds me of a larger budget version of enemy mine in which we get barely a glimpse of a war torn future before the hero is dumped on a barely habitable planet struggles for survival and ends up in your basic action climax like dennis quaid and louis gossett jr in that movie kurt russell gives a performance better than his material deserves which isn t saying much since a lot of soldier plays like it was written for stallone at the height of his rambo misanthropy the cast is generally good particularly russell s finely understated performance his character s lifelong conditioning has made him incapable of expressing emotion or even speaking conversationally he robotically addresses everyone but the enemy as sir yet he conveys enough in his body language to make more of his role than one might expect another reviewer called this a sequel to blade runner and compared russell s sgt todd to br s deckard without arguing too much i d modify that by saying it s more of a blade runner prequel thematically if not literally it s essentially the backstory of blade runner s roy batty an enhanced combat soldier bred for offworld service but never regarded as truly human who rebels against his shortsighted human masters and leads his followers to a prospective home on another world of course todd s stoic efficiency bears little resemblance to batty s charismatic dark angel persona but they re flipsides of the same coin the fact that both films were written by the same screenwriter becomes clear long before the credits roll listen for the tanhauser gate reference soldier isn t a great movie by any stretch if anything it has the feel of a script written back in the s that had gathered dust on a shelf until someone felt like filming it take it on that level and it s watchable not great but good enough to pass a little time 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
caged heat is dead beat this movie was a big dissapointment lame acting lame script and s chicks with bad acting skills not a very good women in prison film there are better one like reform school girls the band caged heat is way better than the movie pass it up and get a life

befuddled i am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie it is merely a monument to hollywood s stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale in dumas s book the count learns that he cannot play god dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life he abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful god hollywood gives us instead triumphant revenge 
the name says it all this movie is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen these minutes seemed more like hours and for chrissake he s not an american 
corny movie i admit that i m a die hard johnny depp fan but this wasn t anywhere near one of his best he is adorable in the movie but the plot is extremely corny and i found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of bikini sporting girls but not much else although there are a few remotely funny parts it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is but then again it was worth it to watch johnny 
three fugitives hours til dawn and alias iam not at all happy that i could not watch this product the three fugitives and hours til dawn and am unable to buy this product in australia i think it suck that dvds have region departments and can only be watched in some countries people should be able to buy a product and be able to watch it the sooner a dvd comes out that is able to be watched in all countries the better 
hate it to violent for anyone ! this movie is horrible the cast is good but the plot stinks ! its just this family who have super powers then this kid wanted to be mr incredibles side kick in a way mr incredible says no so then he hates him then the kid turns evil and kills people and wants every body to like him thats origanal there are barely any jokes you laugh once every minutes and there is way to much violence killing guns punching bombs and they say stupid words sometimes i do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence so i do not recommend this movie to anyone especially the disc special edition ! 
it may sound ugly but this is good and bad i would have to agree with both the positive and negative comments about this version of mozart s die zauberflote all the technical and production comments are accurate enough but also and more importantly this opera is written in german and i m a big believer in performing great operatic works not only in their entirety but also in their original language and most importantly for myself the opera is intended to be a comedy yesbut a black comedy ! this production turns it into a farce which is why children probably love it so much if the kiddies saw this opera as intended regardless of choice of language they would probably go running and screaming to dive under their beds and shake ! the evil queen really is evil ! more like in disney s sleeping beauty than say jareth in the labyrinth as a reference only i think one is able to get a little more comfortable with bergman s queen than mozart intended nough said 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
tough going reading this novel was slow going as a guy i found the lack of action stultifying and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them the answer to the book s primary riddle who shall emma marry becomes obvious early on and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered there s a bit of local and historical color but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of say a summer outing not one of jane austen s best 
i can t believe people enjoy this movie this movie is complete garbage i actually like robert downey jr as an actor but hated him in this movie please do yourself a favor and don t watch this trash 
wake up i agree where is the dvd for a soon to be obsolete format get real this is an excellent mini series on the worse medium 
negative stars because there were so many great reviews for this movie i decided to go out and rent this film and watch it i was bored to death watching this film and whats with the words whats wrong kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice those words and that voice really annoyed me ! why does this place have not one person with hair now i m not trying to be raciest here but what s with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t v well i can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up what s with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate was he supposed to be gay i guess this film is way to so called artsy for me what i know is that this film is boring and when it comes to ending you don t know what happends to the guy at the end the film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway this film makes the movie the village exciting to watch i wish that i could give my money back

good basis this film is an integral one in the study of film adaptation of jane austen s most popular novel pride and prejudice it represents the beginning of a serious love affair between film and austen novels however it is not great in terms of adaptation if you love pride and prejudice and have never seen this film skip it it will only anger you if you re studying film adaptation of austen novels you must see this one as it has influenced everything that came afterwards and its laurence olivier afterall

warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
lordy at its outset the update film version of golding s classic novel is creepy and cinematically mysterious we see the commotion as the boys try to make it to the island while many of the adults are apparently dead or clinging to life all trying to swim towards shore after the plane went down in this version the boys who make it to the island are from an american military cadet school instead of being english the early stages of the film really do keep the impact of the story alive but as the film wanes so does the mystique of the tale its really hard to know who to blame the child actors who played these characters ineffectively or the screenwriters for putting in a slew of profanity and inane parts to the movie the children who played these characters for the most part did what they could with this script for what it is worth i really liked how simon was personified in several of the scenes especially the one with the monster the beast in the other movie version you really get a sense that he is like the character in the book as he connects with nature and seems to not fear what the others do the mysterious creature in the cave ralph s character was depicted in an appropriate way also for the most part however jack s character was just way too one demensional he seemingly never had a chance to grow into the antagonist because he was already one when the movie started it probably didn t help that jack s character had profanity laced tirades aimed at ralph and piggy for a good deal of the film and these moments seemingly killed any originality that the movie could have had lines from some of jack s servants were kind of asinine also the chief has spoken perhaps this film could have also done a better job of building the momentum of the story it seemed like events were happening too quick one minute they don t know how to hunt the next they are experts they could have also built up the character conflicts between jack roger and ralph piggy a little better they are seemingly friends one minute and enemies the next if you completely forget that this is lord of the flies or even related to it and take this movie as just a modern survival story you will be better served for what it is worth i am not a big fan of the other version of lord of the flies either although it is better than this one maybe they can update the novel one more time and get it right stars 
here we go again release different ones well warner is releasing duplicate episodes again why don t they put all the scooby doos out they have dvds of cartoons out and hassle in the castle is on of them out of the episodes on this dvd are already on dvd i don t think anyone should pay dollars for only episode that isn t released yet i am getting the other ones that are coming out though so in short i don t reccommend this to anyone not only that they are wasting a whole dvd for only eps of which are already out they should release different ones like terror in the big top dr jeckyl and mr hyde and other ones from the series they should release scooby movies with speed buggy and josie and the pussycats in short i ll just say i am sick of duplicate scooby episodes 
relaxing viewing time a dvd of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company really only suitable for watching in private 
this is travolta s passion of the christ imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing then you would have battlefield earth it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project just awful if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
i know fred twoo the personality of a nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance fred leuchter was painted as such by many people some who knew him and i m guessing knew better and as we may be witnessing others who didn t brownshirts insult assault rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas maybe a major lesson of the holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to so long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas there must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist so that they may prove their allegiance to the group maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent as dissent does not equal disloyalty except in a nazi state there was a great free press in germany in nazi times so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries mr death is not representation of fred leuchter fred leuchter is representation of fred leuchter might i suggest not suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary that s not clarification that s reinforcement of one idea rather go and find fred and speak to him get his view if you don t have a preformed agenda like van pelt or morris you may get him to respond like i did i found a different fred and a much much different story than i was given by director morris and others the question is not whether german gas chambers were used to murder people the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that or any other idea that is without having his house firebombed a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place have his reputation ruined or any of the other stuff happen if fred s ordeal is any indication the brownshirts are alive and well but i don t think fred is one of them the one fact i would alter in my previous post is rabbi bauer s support for no gas chambers bauer supported fred s methods not necessarily his conclusion i tried in vain to contact bauer on where he differs with fred fred has high regard for rabbi bauer the polish forensic investigation which came soon after fred s did not come to the same conclusion as fred but did essentially duplicate fred s data collection methods and results there was testimony at the nuremburg trials by both inmates and german staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in germany in physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there it took years for simon weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those german concentration camps a former inmate at auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there but all this isn t to say that the auschwitz gassings didn t occur but rather to simply say that some may think they didn t occur and for that they shouldn t be condemned unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like fred 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
dreadful this film is so bad on so many levels it s painful to watch it knowing carpenter put his name on it there is no suspense no timing poor visual effects and the director seems awol through most of the film it looks like a ucla freshman film project shot in days in a warehouse these actors we know from previous work can act move through it mouthing stilted dialog that seems disconnected to the visual events all around them ice cube looks and acts like a la hood who somehow has wandered into a bad b movie set and wants out now ! natasha henstridge is decorative but unbelievable as a hard case cop with a drug problem who will save the team the rest are probably thankful they get killed off early the real mystery about gom is how could the man who did that masterpiece of directing cinematography and cutting the thing do this mess 
old documentary please think this dvd is recorded in more worse this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of quotcompanyquot same worst sound quality documentary i suspect the word quotconcertquot or quotsoundtrackquot in dvd title 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha 
great movie ghastly dvd transfer i ordered this the night of the oscars i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy there wasn t even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging it looks like a bad vhs transfer i should have returned it but it would ve been more trouble than it was worth i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be but unfortunately in my case i have to add buyer beware 
huh my wife and i looked at eachother with one eyebrow raised basically saying huh the only reason i gave this movie stars is because a couple of the stories were actually interesting however they just didn t go anywhere and i was left disappointed there was no apparent purpose or meaning to this movie if you are wondering whether or not to watch this movie please pass this one by

poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
ambrose bierce is a better authority i have rented this video for the sake of a trip down memory lane of course fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility i hated this video for its teaching of american ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable for example in 
basic incompetence by everyone across the board this movie should be shown to classrooms of aspiring screenwriters and directors as an example of how not to be sucked into the hollywood junk machine the screenwriter of this movie obviously had some ideas about a coherent story that he wanted to tell about moral relativity and corrupt military officials this film s story structure is mostly influenced by the classic film rashomon well so what happened how did this ungracious disaster of a movie make it to the big screen the biggest culprits are easily the movie stars john travolta and samuel l jackson using their bloated star egos to force the screenwriter to rework his material into something they ultimately found more suitable to their star personas disgusting ! travolta was supposed to be a bad guy and jackson was supposed to bite the bullet but no way would the two hollywood jerks allow that spoiler alert who in their right mind was surprised by the ending i knew sam jackson was in on it from the get go and soon enough he would grace us with his presence lo and behold his bald head emerges at the end of the movie wearing a white outfit like an angel of some sort i hate this movie it s an insult to the audience ! john mctiernan predator die hard the director of basic should be ashamed of such a lackluster effort on his part but what could he do when faced with the two morons who played the leads ! a sad joke of a movie avoid it unless you just love junk 
where is the old hunter buldeo the best of rudyard kipling s jungle book stories took place in the man village because that s where mowgli meets a superstitious old hunter named buldeo buldeo claims that the tiger shere khan is supernatural the ghost of a wicked old money lender when mowgli says that shere khan is only a very disagreeable tiger buldeo threatens to spank our young hero when buldeo learns that mowgli has a vendetta with the tiger and a black panther as his personal body guard the old man tells the other villagers that mowgli is a demon child who is able to turn himself from a boy to a wolf and back to a boy at will this is great story telling but where is buldeo he isn t in the movie at all ! it s like leaving the wicked witch out of the movie version of the wizard of oz on a side note in the kipling stories the black panther bagheera has a secret so shameful he can tell no one but mowgli bagheera was born in a zoo chained and keep in a cage for the amusement of men but rather than blame mowgli for the cruelty he suffered in captivity bagheera sees the boy as a kindred spirit they were both separated from their own kind at an early age once we have that bit of information the relationship between the boy and the panther makes sense we are able to understand bagheera s total devotion to the mowgli but the movie never explains that i realize that the movie shouldn t follow the book completely but since the book was so much richer the movie seemed like a let down 
zurian good grief i know this is supposed to be a classic and all but is this the best the producers could do maybe i m missing the point but i ve seen better c category movies whats up with the one robot mass invasion how did they get here what shot down the military planes i could even see the eyes of the person inside the tin foil outfit the characters seem to stay neatly cleaned and pressed throughout or maybe that s part of the fun well ha ha 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
ultimately pretty pointless the only thing that kept me watching this movie was to see if there was going to be a twilight zone type ending that tied it all together remember the zone where five wildly different people a clown a cowboy a ballerina etc are trapped in a round room and when they finally escape you find out that they re just dolls in a trash can it was a lame zone but i thought of that watching this movie as kelly lynch wanted to stay inside that abandoned desert house and wondered if that house was going to be a place between life and death that kelly might have been hovering between the two in that room and that her new husband was satan or an angel something really off thewallbut it didn t happen it s pretty much a straight forward story of dysfunctional low lifes trying to figure out their messy lives without telling us very much about themselves the acting is very good and kelly lynch looks great naked even with bandages on her wrists and wearing a dirty hosptial gown for the whole movie but the story gets lost in the desert and what the heck happened to that baby that shows up for a couple of scenes and then disappears thats what i was wondering about for the rest of the movie but nothing more is said 
the boring movie this was just a boring movie cant understand the otherreview s saying it s good wouldn t reccomend it 
horrid film this is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw i took a girl ona date for this movie and wow what a mistake the movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more 
bad one for charlie charles bronson is one of my favorites but violent city is example of s trash at it s worst boring slow pacing and a seesaw action that gets old really fast bronsons character is so stupid acting in this film for a hitman that you wish he would get killed off himself i love charles bronson but this is one of his dud films 
if you re a school teacher and thinking about using this film in your class please read this first whether william golding deserved nobel prize or not is still a debatable point but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book and its name is lord of the flies but let s not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while because after all no one i am afraid can bring the multi layered world of words onto the screen even those who loved the version would admit that you can interpret the meaning of lord of the flies but who can really visualize it or the imaginary conversations of simon for that matter the biggest problem of harry hook s new version is not the changes done to the film the boys are american military school cadets using dirty words frequently but those parts didn t annoy me much real problem is something more essential to the film which is storytelling in short the film doesn t know what it wants to be on the film s video cover you can read and i quote this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul well not exactly for as adventure story it lacks pace the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing as allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character the conflict between ralph and jack should be clearer and piggy s role should be more than that of a whining fat boy and don t forget simon who sees things it is true but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us it is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful it could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop opposite of optimistic tales of jules verne s adventure stories by watching this film you can follow the story of the book but find no tension or thought provoking words in it balthazar getty s feature film debut and lewis m allen one of the producers of the film had also produced peter brook version in

boring i liked the first two spy kids movies pretty well the first one was well done and the acting great the second one was maybe a bit less than the first but still entertaining this movie however was incredibly lame and absolutely boring my brother went to see it with my mom in theaters and for some reason they came back saying it was soooo good when it came out on dvd i watched it with my brother only twenty minutes into it i was wishing i could leave all the amazing d computer animated sequences were giving me terriblel headaches and i no reason whatsoever to watch this drivel as a previous reviewer said the spy kids series lost its charm after the second installment in this movie they were trying to go out with a bang but fell miles short of the finish line the acting seemed stale and unemotional the humor was lame and not even funny and the whole things seemed like a weird dream the director thought might make a decent movie overall it seems to me that this was just one mega test for the even worse flop the adventures of sharkboy and lavagirl i have no appreciation for this director any more and unless he gives us something good fast i probably won t be watching anymore of his films any time soon 
poor quality i m not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot it s redundant and unnecessary and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that s based on and well my gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it s original format onto dvd was bad the soundtrack is about to second off from the video part of film therefore the voices don t sync up with the lip movement 
ratner is a lousy film maker this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it s patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making x men will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke 
tom hanks is great ! that said read on i personally feel tom hanks is a really fantastic actor with the exception of this particular movie i ve enjoyed every movie i ve ever seen him in i don t understand what went wrong with the ladykillers perhaps it was the director the editor the script i don t know but this movie was so awful i couldn t sit through it i purchased a copy of it just knowing i d absolutely love it because tom hanks was in it but i ended up pawning it off on some unsuspecting co worker 
disapointed i was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd i would not recommend anyone buying this dvd until the quality is back to that of a professional recording 
the mystery goes on i had heard all the hype about this film and ginger s oscar but after several viewings i still find the film rather flat as an experience and ginger s oscar is still a mystery i guess it proves the adage about winning one for women play plain or ugly remember charlize theron or play against type 
somewhat interesting if dated and polemical this tape includes two very different pieces from buuel directed at not too distant time from each other the late s and the early s the first is un chien andalou which is credited as being codirected by salvador dali this surreal short must have been terribly shocking when it was made but i think that more than years later a lot of its impact has softened perhaps because its surreal tricks have appeared in a lot of later movies the second piece is flawed too though at least is more interesting and i think more polemical also it s a minute documentary about life in one of spain s poorest regions what i find wrong about this movie is that while buuel gleefully shows us the poverty and ignorance of the people living there he doesn t have much clues and doesn t seem to care much of how to solve this now years later spain is much richer than it was then and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of leftism that buuel favored but with western european style capitalism shockingly in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror buuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation all in all two pieces that have not aged well 
medicore at best i really felt like i had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not you people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie with how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up from a close friendship to a romantic relationship the guys don t even display a close friendship at the beginning how are they gonna jump from a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building to hot and heavy can t live without each other love its not believable and doesn t make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be the movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene and from there they are suddenly in love and everything in fact there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene i mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time or even was interested in guys in general but as i said before the movie doesn t display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene dont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren t really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are highly overrating it so if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy if you re looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship look somewhere else this is not the movie 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
don t waste your money on this one talentless people and garbage music torture you in this turkey in no time flat youll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming make it stop out into the yard do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense 
save your read the book one of the last of the biblical epics this was a bomb in its initial release and deservedly so the movie doesnt know whether it is de mille or italian realism and most of the sequences adam eve tower of babel are either laughable or langorous george c scott ava gardner as abraham sarah yet stuck in the middle is a fine half hour sequence of the story of noah with director john huston casting himself in the one strong sequence in the movie replete with the right mix of humor and awe that half hour isnt enough to recommend buying or renting the dvd but if you can catch it on tv some day its worth a half hour of your life 
turn it off if pac was still here now he would never ride with ja nah nah nah nah nah na 
don t let rob schneider steal more money i guess we can thank the global population for making rob schneider a leading actor by continually buying tickets to that deuce bigalow fiasco i could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn i guess i have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight this body transforming opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again but not this badly if the dwarf size schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he s been on a narcotics binge for months on end you might like this film i can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for lawrence olivier to be convincing the majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren t remotely funny girls having pillow fights where schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow literally the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it s the most vile thing you ve ever seen schneider falling down bleachers smashing his face against every seat a cross dressing eight yearold boy adam sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar he makes a cameo talks so low you can t understand a word he s saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer two things make this film at least worth watching if you re as mind numbingly bored and desperate as i was last night whoever the foley artist was for this film should never work again pillows making contact schneider falling down rear end slapping its all the same sound it s exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below anna faris i can t decide whether i think she s really cute or if she s just a plain jane with large eyes but when i m thinking she s pretty cute she s nice to look at 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
not for people who jiggle i m overweight and was looking for something with more cardio aerobics than what i had so i could burn some fat this video is not for anyone with flab you ll be jiggling all over and tripping on your feet this is for people who want to tone not lose weight it s also very bad for people that aren t super coordinated i got frustrated and turned it off after ten minutes there is no teaching or steps to show you the moves she just jumps right in at full speed and leaves you behind wondering what the hell is going on 
not bad but not great either children of men transports us to the year where the world has not experienced a new birth in years due to mass human infertility as a result people have lost hope and have turned violent suddenly a pregnant woman capable of producing life appears out of nowhere and the chase is on in short the acting is pretty good but nothing wonderful the plot is quite interesting while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average in a nutshell it s probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection but it might provide for an evening s entertainment and that s about it it lacks that extra something to put it over the top no masterpiece here 
befuddled i am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie it is merely a monument to hollywood s stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale in dumas s book the count learns that he cannot play god dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life he abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful god hollywood gives us instead triumphant revenge 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
been better books by seuss this is an interesting seuss book the moral that it is trying to portray is good but the story is pretty lame and it doesn t seem to flow as nicely as most seuss books 
what a bad movie i wouldn t recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone due to a high content of bad words screaming and violence it s kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else some people really enjoyed it and that s not me and that s not the other two people i know who watched it some violent parts are a bit hard to believe but i guess that s what the story is about this movie is a bit of a hollywood style suspense with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies theres one good idea in this movie and that s how life develops as it goes along and one action or inaction changes how life plays out but this is no where near original even the simpsons had an episode like that so this movie is definitely not on my best movies list 
what shark i watched this movie seeing that it was a shark movie but where s the shark the plot is these people are hostages the shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie but i was watching going okay they re in the water where is the shark even jaws which sucked has more sharks if you like hoatage movies see this on second thought don t but if you like sharks see something else 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer 
only mildly interesting and no classic i saw this at the library and brought it home thinking it might be interesting to watch i very rarely watch films made after the s but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable it ended up being only mildly enjoyable and a bit boring i felt that within all the time it ran we didn t really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters seemed to remain in shallow waters all along the film was sort of good pretty photography and for the most part it seemed like the costumes hair way of speaking etc were accurate for the time period so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when but something just wasn t quite right and it is hard to know exactly what it was i was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate i think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity i am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed so i would not recommend this film for families with young children because of the nudity 
might of been funny then back in when no one had done anything like this it was probably hysterical ! but any one episode of mystery science theater no matter which one is at least three times as funny as this at least in my opinion this movie has a few funny moments but i am glad i saw this as a rental and not a purchase 
aerial gunner typical of the war movies of that age very much the americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice i enjoyed looking at an america that was would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life 
uncle buck with john candy this movie was not entertaining at all bad script etc

i can t see ya but i know you re here i can feel it the story of wim wenders wings of desire is told through images and thoughts abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it two angels glide through the streets of berlin surveying its inhabitants cassiel otto sander embraces his role as witness but damiel bruno ganz wants to break free of his ethereal existence he is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life the primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist marion solveig dommartin wings of desire does not quite work it stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous rather it stumbles because it is just too abstract relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives wings of desire deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream like visuals yet it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer 
not my cup of tea i bought this dvd based on reviews here on amazon i won t fault others for thier position it s just a matter of personal taste for me this was a big disapointment the story leaves a lot to be desired the character walker lee marvin gets away with a lot of crimes he shouldn t have the direction seemed to be a practice in doing something different but it failed i m sorry i bought this dvd 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
how to destroy your career in one simple movie george sluizer s original dutch french version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema s most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you ve seen that version you probably still can t get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its lady vanishes plot the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this us remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from dok tah e ville no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they don t even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they re given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the high low mood shifts in the couple s relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he s probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame lets end on a joke like a tv cop show moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score can t do anything for this one 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
power i could not get interested in this movie it was slow moving and boring 
don t waste your money unfortunately i didn t read the reviews below before i bought this dvd it s a travesty of the dvd medium perhaps fox lorber took the story of the movie too seriously they ve produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy don t waste your money on it 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
pretty woman meets toxic tort even though i would agree that erin brockovich is an entertaining movie julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath story but this movie has such shaky roots in reality it is more of a tall tale than the true story of a historic class action suit that i would imagine left more unhappy plaintiffs than it did satisfied ones however as the movie title implies this is indeed erin brockovich s story in the same way that the xena character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess though it should be noted that xena s wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character erin brockovich is a vain brassy boorish single mother of three young children with no marketable work skills a transparently opportunistic manner who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in pretty woman prior to richard gere s character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree the movie s beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident her lawsuit is lost primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony swearing cursing and shrieking from the witness stand while being questioned by opposing counsel unbelievably erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney s played by albert finney firm mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk later while handling the paperwork for a run ofthemill pro bono real estate sale erin discovers the file contains the seller s medical records that for reasons she correctly does not understand seem to be of particular interest to the buyer the mega utility company pacific gas and electric erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg e had for decades negligently contaminated the ground water surrounding one of their power plants in near hinkley ca on the edge of the mojave desert with toxic hexavalent chromium this discovery leads to the queen mother of all class action lawsuits at least in terms of the award in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg e by and through the representation of erin s boss in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs roberts gives a photogenic if not especially gifted performance in her role as erin the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts literally gushing out skin tight low cut bustier inspired work clothes that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents while there is much to be said for erin s apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit she is not an especially likeable character rather she is rude verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry the aged and weary attorney who is erin s boss the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy five inchedheeled mules than on the sometimes interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters aaron eckhart plays the affable gentle biker and next doorneighbor george who becomes erin s boyfriend byconvenience the convenience factor is totally one sided and for erin s benefit exclusively she unabashedly uses george for free live in childcare thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar bonus check from masry when the tort action case settles contrastingly george gets a thanks for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed make no mistake this movie is about erin brockovich indeed i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present and less about the brave struggles with life threatening generation spanning illnesses that the real life plaintiffs were forced to face due to the toxicity in their water source erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience in typical hollywood fashion as a sort of heroine but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich is the movie entertaining absolutely inspiring not even slightly 
just another pitiful tired retread after watching this lame stupid sequel all i can say is leave it alone already god this film sucked first after years of trying to escape from brother michael this is how laurie strode goes out major let down it should have been more shocking and spectacular second while years later halloween was made for lifetime this one seems to have been made for mtv all dimension films has done for this franchise since taking it over for part is give it style no substance whatsoever the only one of their sequels that was remotely scary was fully due to bringing back the guy who played michael in the last good halloween film george wilbur he s sorely missed but probably too old for the part now third i m so sick of rappers and models thinking they can act as is the case in this film with busta rhymes and tyra banks no talent busta needs to stick to cursing and throwing his hands around to a repetitive beat and tyra needs to stick to walking a catwalk in some designer dress with her mouth shut they suck hopefully hollywood feels the same way since i haven t seen them in anything since thank god fourth the story is just another retread with a new gimmick the internet web cam poorly executed no suspense at all in this film the film was originally suppossed to be released for halloween but they had to do reshoots to improve the film unsuccessfully i might add so it was released in summer funny this film was directed by the same guy who directed halloween ii the best sequel even funnier is the fact that they had to do reshoots for that one as well but john carpenter did them and it did improve the film his touch is sorely missed here so if dreadful acting except jaime lee curtis but she s only in the first minutes unfortunately boring dumb story and dialogue shockless routine kill scenes and no scares or suspense unless your years old and have never seen a horror film if all that s your cup of tea then by all means watch or buy this waste of time money effort if there was any it s just another insult to fans of the original and now for next halloween we will get halloweenthe remake directed by none other than the man who brought us the classic not house of corpses rob zombie im also sick of bad singers thinking they can direct the choice is refective of hollywood nowadays style over substance cool and trendy over timeless and great 
it was well you d have to see it to believe me this movie was a lot of things it was funny not funny haha but funny that s retarded it was silly and it was amusing one of the things however it was not was good my personal favorite part was when the children were break dancing with the glowing orb now this is a movie with substance to begin the tale to which this movie is about is to well dig deep into one s imagination or a psycho s you see there is this orpanage with these kids and they live during the future when there is no water on the surface of the planet however i m not really sure of all the facts because my brain tends to weed out the useless info anyways they find an orb dance with it and try to escape for some reason again info has vanished anyways they run into and indian tribe small cities some people that live underground etc what i m trying to say is that this is definately a b movie so unless you want to watch a bad movie with friends to laugh at don t bother lesson learned from solarbabies if you find a glowing orb be nice to it it could help you save the world and teach you to break dance 
yawn boring debbie does salls is much better i hate these titilating movies bit a pube some t ado yourselves a favor either try and get hold of the old s pornos like debbie does dallas jade pussycat good girls of godiva taboo these old movies have a story plus lots of hard core thrills 
what horrific garbage while i was watching this movie i thought to myself am i going to die have i gone to horrible movie hell you see i was trapped in a theater it s like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can t leave cause b actors are pretending they can act just because they re fat the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it s grossly bright outside and it s a sunday afternoon and you re in a car and you ve been sitting for hours and you feel sweaty and there a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape in conclusion this movie turns me into melting snow but i suppose there are worse movies see my review on gummo 
another crappy camp experience it wasnt all that bad it had its moments brad renfro bully dominique swain faceoff keram malicki sanchez tvs buffy the vampire slayer emily bergl the rage carrie justin long jeepers creepers james king bulletproof monk and jordan bridges mona lisa smile son of jeff bridges star as camp counslers who have well a lot of problems peter stormare eight millimeter is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp emotions relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way james king former model looks good dipping in that lake hmm renfro and swain are so wrong for each other they should be a couple in real life bergl is hot to the bone bridges is a bastard long is a hoot as a nerdy geek type of characer and sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others stomare is just weird plain weird and the kids are brats so if you liked heathers because daniel waters wrote it then this is the movie for yo 
the worst ever this is surely one of the worst movies ever made and may indeed take the title no one can act the plot was there a script is absurd the music is dreadful and the director must have been high much of the time this comedy horror film is neither funny nor slasher enjoyable it s simply stupid have we as a people actually reached the point of cultural degradation symbolized by this film i saw this in prime time on the independent film channel it has permanently forfeited its reputation 
disappointing would love to see a good remake this movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them for a theater lover this is heartbreaking what a disappointing story if a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class a adulterer even the ending was changed and not for the better the dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing a pretty face is not enough 
but why is it called belly the american dream is an appealing myth no doubt the idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in america sounds great the problem as george carlin put it is that you have to be asleep to believe in it so instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs and that is where belly comes in an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it this urban drama stars dmx perpetually rapping nas and method man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies the story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs when the plot does poke its head up i picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from queens to omaha once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot one couple tries to escape to africa but find it easier said than done and tommy dmx is sent on a mission to kill a minister but really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn t even exist come on now i ve known drug dealers in my day and they didn t live in large gaudy mansions rap stars do rather they live in shacks or their parent s basement if my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is the directing by hype williams isn t that bad he is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks the lighting never seems quite right but i m gonna let that one slide as a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films i can hardly complain about their presence here there people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions all that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that i am going to give it as the most nihilistic person i know i am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used the n and f words are used to comedic proportions their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason and then on top of it all we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us sorry man but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn t make you any less slimy than those wall street hacks you re still a businessman this film is not worth watching any social point that is made is made accidentally and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta 
where is jermaine jackson s music video this dvd is a waste they should ve included jermaine jackson smusic video closest thing to perfect i read somewhere else online thatjamie lee curtis was in the video when they bring these movies on dvd they need toinclude extras like the music videos off the soundtracks i don t understand why some do and others don tsome company executives just don t know what they re doing dont waste your money on this dvd with no extras scott 
a true loss of faith faith hathaway had just graduated high school and was one week away from going into the army she was full of hope and life robert willie the man this movie was based on along with his accomplice raped and murdered her she was raped stabbed times and raped after she died the director of this movie denied requests made by faith s mother and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die where was the mercy for faith where was the compassion for faith where were the people protesting for faith s life finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to faith what about her suffering and that of her family barely a foot note in this movie ohh and sister prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case 
pretty to look at but i was not thrilled with this work here s why the movie jumps about in non logical fashion that distracts from the flow it is beautifully filmed with great costumes colors imagery but the acting is so bland almost weak ! christ i wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate ! the sex scenes were boring maybe i should make films ! this is frustrating ! it had it s moments so stars wish someone would make a movie about narcissus and goldmund or cloister and the hearth now that would be passionate ! unless amblin or touchstone did it 
i hated this film this film after reading all of the reviews i was so excited to view a great film however after about an hour of waiting for something plausible to happen it just drifted and drifted and meandered and oh here s a scene she says no to the main character advances and he ignores her initial rejection and then it meanders more into something so absurd that i started to laugh cmon people ! to all of you and star people just because a film involves beautiful settings and artsy characters that does not constitute a story ! im sorry maybe it s me but message to the character claudia in the movie if some cad starts coming onto you while he s simultaneously searching for his fiancee and your friend who may very well have drowned then get a miles away from this scum and to all viewers watching this exercise in self indulgence and boredom get a miles away from this farce of a film i am an enormous fan of stylish artistic films but just like those paintings at fancy museums that are being portrayed as elite art but instead are just simple circles and triangles on a blank canvas this film is not art it s just boring boring boring uninteresting i could not care about these characters any less other than poor anna who disappeared from that island actually now that i think about it anna was the only smart one there ! she jumped off that island as quickly as she could so as get out of this ostentatious boring pompous self indulgent uneventful dreadful meandering dumb film way to go anna ! you re the only one with any sense even if you did drown trust me that is a better fate than having to survive this dull film so in case you didn t get my point let me spell it out once again i hated this film so completely ! i would rather watch water trickling from my sink at least that has a story ! aaaargh i want my hours back ! i gave up precious hours of my life to watch this pathetic film 
nl bomb i just purchased this film and viewed it it is the biggest waste of money buyer beware i love national lampoon but this was not a hit 
zero chemistry set against the backdrop of the spanish civil war quottalk of angels quot could have been provocative and sweeping but it settles for little more than standard issue governess falls for the rich guy romance vincent perez has a smoldering presence but the beautiful polly walker is as flat on screen as a fascist protest poster the two have little chemistry the result a stilted and perfunctory outing the only saving grace is the always wonderful frances mcdormand whose hard bitten love struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest 
fatally flawed sure this movie is a classic but is it any good frankly i found it to be tedious in the extreme its certainly pleasant to look at the sets are quite amazing and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful the story as described in detail in many other reviews here has potential as both a thriller and a thought provoking essay ultimately it is neither the acting is top notch as are all of the special effects those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory in fact all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic but the whole thing never rises to its premise its thriller aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed the only key that can stop the nuke ! the resolution is an afterthought a quick fix in the extreme and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is narrowly whew averted the characters are thin at best and stock at worst this movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early s thought technology would be like in the mid s yawn i must laugh at the whole bell paper bit it means nothing to the plot and is the ultimate contrivance if a deadly virus actually came back from space there would certainly be action on many fronts with plenty of interesting conflict to go around some people would try to understand it others would want only to kill it there s some potentially interesting tension right there some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public others would want to warn them again that could have been a good source of tension someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon mentioned in passing but never developed while others would try very hard to prevent that more tension im just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow moving scenes which it actually contains this movie is the poster child for boring science fiction and it would not have had to be that way i haven t read the book but i bet it s a lot better at its core this movie is a boring dud 
bad very bad this is not a good tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination the worse thing about the film is the horrible unconvincing special effects the scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking quotits coming closer quot is badly done and also dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest i know however a guy named mike and robots who would probably have to endure this terrible b grade movie actually f grade if you want a good entertaining tornado movie that doesn t include bad acting bad quotspecialquot fx bad script and dumb actors check out quottwisterquot 
love in the afternoon pleasant movie but nothing special a very ordinary story audrey hepburn s charisma is what puts some life to the movie some subtle humour though

star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
yuck yuck what was i thinking when i put this movie on my rental list i couldn t even begin to tell you i guess from watching the previews i expected something a touch different but what i go was the typical teen movie you guys know what i m talking about they make someone over to get even they get jealous someone falls in love now they want revenge the only thing diffent was the reason for the revenge there was more to high school than the cheerleaders the ball players and all their drama i don t want the cheerleaders and ball players to be offended because i had some great friends that either was a cheerleader or a ball player lol ok maybe just the ball players but for the movie makers be creative come with something new maybe it s me growing up but these teen movies are getting tired with their same ol routines 
the story of rubin carter according to rubin carter the first thing you should know about the hurricane is that it was based on two books one of which the sixteenth round was written by rubin carter the second thing you should know is that rubin carter is not a man of exemplary honesty the third thing you should know is that the other book lazarus and the hurricane on which this movie was based was written by two of the canadians who bought into carter s hokum as have so many after them i will not go into a point bypoint list of the patently false claims that carter makes in his book since other posters here have already done a good job of that instead i d like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews these are divided into three groups the first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride if you belong in this group i do not fault you hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public but let me ask you this if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title hero would you still rate it highly if your answer is yes then you belong in the second group those who gave this movie a thumbs up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies to this group i have this to say if a filmmaker wants to present a true life story he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right it s called integrity and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability you say this is a dramatization and not a documentary well even a dramatization should be done with some integrity i can go along with some minor embellishments here and there but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story that in my book is unforgivable and so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie s dishonesty vested interest does not render their arguments invalid finally to the third group those who actually believe that carter is in fact a martyr scholar i ask you to please open your eyes there is absolutely no documentation to support carter s claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile that he was a civil rights activist that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image on the other hand there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man s delusional fantasies you say that cal deal the man behind graphicwitness com is a racist please visit graphicwitness com carterracismhtml also know this deal went into the rubin carter case actually believing that carter was innocent it took just one interview for deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in carter s statements he went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed carter as a liar many accounts today have it that carter is a changed man i sincerely hope this is a real change and not just a show but whatever the case the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash im not counting on that though 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
a propaganda film gone wrong this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film barbet schroeder s film a selfportrait of the infamous ugandan dictator idi amin generated much controversey and even death threats idi amin himself demanded that schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in uganda the film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to amin the dvd only has an interview with director barbet schroeder for a special feature although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes this film has significance but is not a good one 
total disappointment blech ! i really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute wrong ! it was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were the only redeeming actor was justin long the rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells

could ve would ve should ve the novel of the same name by joyce carol oates on which this movie was based is beautiful moving transcendent heartbreaking lyrical and unforgettable the movie on the other hand felt like the after school special version of the book do yourself a favor and read the novel instead make them regret all they ever did to you and your sisters 
where s the love although i applaud the fact that zhang yi mou can portray a love story without reverting back to sexual escapades this moving is just plain boring ! when you are watching it it takes forever and there is also this min snooze of an intro he takes explaining the background for the lovestory between his parents goodness gracious do something ! zhang zi yi does a great job of prancing about in her pigtails but i too am flabbergasted as to how his parents ever fell in love unbelievably they said like two words to each other before deciding they loved each other i dont call that a great love story i call it a rd grade lunch recess fling 
outlaw all post release editing this is truly one the most spectacular films ever made not suffering for having been made during the silent era however as correctly stated by another review of the film the dvd version runs to mins as oppossed to the vhs mins this is not due to dvd faster frame rate but rather because the dvd version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason at one point the hero fairbanks has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose tree the next minute he is seen explaining to her in an intimate scene that he is not what he seems having seen the vhs a number of times i can confirm that the dvd version has been brutally cut do not buy the dvd version as it is a let down with those scenes missing thus the reason for my one star which would otherwise have been stars with the rimsky korsakov soundtrack you have been warned 
so so though this is by no means argento s worst film his phantom of the opera was pure rubbish this film is also not among his best and was a disappointment even to argento he considered the production of this film cursed in a way himself buying into the superstition which was part of the plot of the film for the argento fan this film is quite enjoyable in a piecemeal sort of way but it simply does not work as a whole the plot is fraught with enormous gaps in logic the scene when characters in the film rely on the memory of birds to identify the killer among opera audience members is utterly absurd and the end monologue in which the herione announces that she doesn t need other people and has a lot in common with insects is absolutely random nonsensical and has absolutely nothing to do with what preceded it in the film such scenes aside what hurts this film the most is its absolutely corny heavy metal soundtrack which has a very negative overall impact on the mood and atmosphere established by the film this said the notorious peephole scene is one of argento s most brilliant and effective sequences in any of his films and this movie is well worth viewing for this scene alone 
gunfight with a weak script i don t think this is regarded as an american classic it s noticeable because it teamed two actors who played off each other quite well even though they only did about four or five movies together the movie is longon being melodramatic weak on script and sometimes burt and kirk kind of over act their scenes the whole story has very little to do with history it s more hollywood and i do not think the guns or the costumes were really around for the period that this movie was dealing with the real doc holiday and wyat erap might have been more grey chaarcters rather then heroic and you have read a lot of books on the american west then you will likely spot tons of historic inaccuracies left and right its for that reason and the others why i do not care for this movie 
the itsy bitsy problem by the time you see the ending you ll already be wishing that you hadn t watched this movie 
o k as a die hard fan of lenny who was born after his death i must warn those that in this he strictly just goes over his court problems and doesn t do routines or bits 
nice idea but too slow to be enjoyable i wonder if bad subtitles ruined the film but it was so painfully slow i found it impossible to sit through i wonder if it picked up but i couldn t tolerate it it s also unbelievable past the normal suspension of disbelief ok there s one guy with deep thoughts but everyone else has deep thoughts and or is a maniac can t anyone have a blank mind like homer simpson 
forget it what this film has is an interesting premise and storyline but unfortunatley it becomes to silly and ridicoulos and the car chase scenes didn t help either bruce willis plays the part of a psychologist that while on vacation visits a friend of his bob moore who is also a psychologist and is later murdered and the chief suspect is in his therapy group bob is determined to find the killer and is also helped by a detective there is also a young atractive woman played by jane march who gets involved with bruce willis s character dr bill capa the films only intresting thing is the therapy group itself which has some odd characters otherwise the film was a lame attempt of being a thriller now i m not a big fan of bruce willis but i have seen much better films with him in it than this including die hard trilogy last man standing and the sixth sense 
ugh this actually could have been a very watchable movie anthony hopkins would be excellent anytime micky rourke is better than usual mimi rogers is great two things make it not so good comparing this to the original there just isn t a comparison amp lindsay crouse oh man she s painful in this one she has a very i mean very bad southern accent amp it ruins the film 
ponderous welcome to bucharest where zachary david gunn the vampire killer has come to hunt the creatures that turned the woman he loved into a monster he had no choice but kill this time his objective is ash jonathan morris a master vampire who maintains his tribe in the secret bucharest underground while operating a very high toned nightclub as a lure for new blood what zachary doesn t count on is his attraction for sofia kirsten cerre a beautiful american pianist who has come to bucharest to perform and who has become the object of ash s desires not only must ash deal with zachary s attempts to destroy his nest and reclaim sofia he has political problems among his own vampire servants welcome to a film where everyone speaks as if they used to have a romanian accents and only saw the scripts a week ago the is a kind of heavy handed lack of emotionality about this film as vampires announce their intent to destroy each other with almost no inflection in their voices while this is a pretty film to watch with lots of midnight scenes of bucharest the moodiness of the cinematography and the score are not matched by the acting obligatory scenes with fake blood and frontal nudity give the work a sense of awkwardness that director ted nicolaou never quite manages to overcome 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
my copy a dud having first seen this film at university twenty years ago i was really looking forward to watching this scary but masterful political propaganda film once again but my copy was a dud about minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies the images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued then the sound froze i had to keep fast forwarding to get through the glitches qa could not have been to rigorous the digital reproduction on the dvd is poor at this point and this continues throughout the whole of the ss review ill be asking for my money back 
shark from some other footage attack shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it s mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
quotis theah a convick in that theah closet quot strange stuff duvall rants gibbers and fires a shotgun into an empty closet haas watches listens and smiles a lot the great james earl jones wanders in scratches his beard and mutters to himself and walks out again if this sounds like your kind of thing jump right in but nobody s ever going to claim this is horton foote s finest hour

i can t see ya but i know you re here i can feel it the story of wim wenders wings of desire is told through images and thoughts abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it two angels glide through the streets of berlin surveying its inhabitants cassiel otto sander embraces his role as witness but damiel bruno ganz wants to break free of his ethereal existence he is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life the primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist marion solveig dommartin wings of desire does not quite work it stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous rather it stumbles because it is just too abstract relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives wings of desire deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream like visuals yet it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
horrible quality black screen with only voices the showing of dora goes to a black screen shortly into the screening this was a waste of money i will never download unboxed items again as they are not good quality don t even bother just buy the dvd 
not worth i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for bucks and i am so glad that i did that said the first series is worth watching for two main reasons overt lesbianism and jinnai the former is self explanatory while the latter jinnai is without a doubt the best character in the series despite the fact that he is the antagonist you can t say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed out character as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story s main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging and this is what makes the second series all four dismal episodes so tragic they nerfed jinnai he could never have been called a genius in the first series but he was decidedly intelligent cool pragmatic supremely self confident and an effective leader even though he was also manic and delusional in el hazard ii as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain they have turned jinnai into a slapstick idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon i suggest purchasing el hazard through alternate means watching the first series and discarding the second let s face it even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
feedback from real apache calculus wiz i saw a few scenes and couldn t even continue watching i like a lot of charles bronson s movies examples include death hunt the s death wish series and the white buffalo but his acting in this movie is unrealistic he does not act like a real apache bronson seems to overdo it on being stoic a relative and i watched a few scenes and just switched channels bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real apache paul newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an apache raised white man in hombre which i purchased on amazon i do applaud bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the s given the time period perhaps bronson should have hired roman gabriel instead he does a realistic job of portraying a cherokee indian in the undefeated which was also released around the same time give or take a couple of years 
one of the worst movies i ve ever seen before i saw this movie i thought i would enjoy it i enjoyed watching the miniseries when i was a kid however nothing could prepare me for what i was about to watch on screen it was an absolute disaster of a film i do enjoy superhero movies some recent ones i like are the spiderman series and batman but the hulk did not inspire me at all it was like going to the dentist to get a tooth pulled the character is a cartoon like green figure totally lacking in his emotional capacities not even his rage convinced me it looked like a video game more than a movie this film had no serious plot worthy of mention it was just plain painful to watch if i could give it half a star i would ! 
buyer beware not what s advertised don t know why my first note hasn t appeared so i ll briefly restate the claim tofame of this film is it s avant garde push theenvelope sexuality amazon describes this film as unrated but that s not what nearly all of these listings are selling these are the new r rated version that is massively redacted in fact all of what makes this film famous has been reduced to some brief nudity even though the box continues to bill it as the sexiest movie ever made on top of that despite an english only cover my vhs purchase was subtitled in spanish the seller has offered an adjustment he didn t know but amazon needs to drop the unrated description as that implies the original those still interested might look for something like a directors cut i still haven t found one sorry if this is a duplicate of previous post 
virginal encounters might be a better title all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why i couldn t even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end in spite of my being a certifiable dirty old man 
much ado about nothing despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi star cast including a top notch soundtrack by u the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations with great performances lost in a bad script it s just a wanna be art movie and nothing else 
awful shambles of an erotic thriller the sex scenes are virtually non existent and the story line is terrible i was very dissapointed with my purchase and encourage all to avoid this film 
not brave enough an english teacher s review to my fellow educators i have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of treasure island i ve seen the version with charlton heston the one with jack palance and the disney version it is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of treasure island has apparently not yet been made as all three were so abysmally bad that i was unable to finish them what no director has yet come close to capturing is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds and the simple directness of stevenson s th century morality tale without exception all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as wythe again and again with each film someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by stevenson apparently wouldn t be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen what i really want to know is if any of these directors actually read the book or had a personal relationship with it i find it hard to believe that they did since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is jim hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn when the captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of a seafaring man with one leg the captain should be tall mysterious powerful and terrifying in two of these films he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos and in the third by some middle aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director s sister it only gets worse from there the tragedy of the captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book but stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the english oak of his adamant constitution the combined forces of rum terror and stroke the captain s fate to fall dead of a thundering apoplexy on the floor of the inn forshadows the essential purpose of stevenson s novel to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death in the guise of a boy s adventure story stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power his pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted they are not caricatures they are not the wax mannequins of a disney ride they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts even with regrets they do not dance or traipse merrily through this story they grimace and battle through it gritting their teeth against the death from violence sickness treachery or rum that is always staring them in their faces jim hawkins innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates hard bitten cynicism and gold lust it is no accident that despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party led by captain smollett it is still only jim hawkins youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from death at the hands of the pirates stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to be like the little children in order to be saved to tell this story properly it must be told absolutely straight and with the same committed earnestness with which stevenson tells it none of these films is that brave to make a film that is faithful to stevenson s moral the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice 
good movie horrible recording artisan has released a horrible recording of a very good sophisticated comedy that questions the values of marriage the dvd i got from the start had poor sound quality faded color and was actually out of focus to add to this this disc started skipping freezing and even getting the vocals out of sequence with the picture don t waste your money on this release wait for a better release 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
can t find a good sleeping pill than buy this movie yes i must admit that i was fooled by the one of the most notorious most debated most banned films of the video nasty era line on this back of this movie case i was lucky because i found this at a best buy for it should be for as bad as it is i ve been let down by these italian horror films one too many times if you want good gore filled italian horror stick with lucio fulci or dario argento once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they re berrible oh by the way unless you are fluent in italian this second disk is almost worthless there is no opportunity to even have english subtitles the only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language 
extremely slow utterly horrible movie i honestly can t believe that robert patrick wasted his time on this piece of junk movie ugh ! one of the worst movies i ve seen in quite a while 
this dvd really sucks even thow im a big survivor foan this dvd really sucked becuse there wernt any chalanges and they showed all the votes and when he was reding the votes they skiped to the last vote plus somany intervuies with the castaways i hope the complete first season has challanges and all that kind of stuff 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
most boring movie i have ever seen i finally decided to purchase this movie considering i was told by one person it was symbolic and by another it was truely disgusting however i found it to be very slow and boring which made want to go to sleep making it difficult for me to actually catch any of this great symbolism i heard about as far as the digusting goes i didn t find it that disgusting compared to some movies i have seen it isn t very explicit in the violence so there is not any gore to it and they aren t very innovative with the torture compared to some movies i have seen the movie consists of alot of monotonous sodomy and an old lady telling stories of her sexual exploits while her friend plays the piano these parts were rather torturous to sit through because they were the most boring in the film and she told quite a few stories if you want to see something shocking i would not look here and if you are looking for symbolism i wouldn t look here because it is difficult to stay awake unless you like watching a bunch of naked people walking around groping one another 
a bomb of a flick except for a few good gore effects this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out ! the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks 
picturesque dvd s make nice beverage coasters this is one creative way in which to recoup some of the loss incurred by buying this nightmare if you are one of the unfortunate who rent this waste of time like i was recommend that your local video store make one empty space on their shelves and toss this loser this minute experience which feels more like days of viewing hell is nothing more then a montage of artsy disjoined surreal scenes it quickly becomes boring after the first minutes tedious after minutes and downright irritating at around minutes i actually made the mistake of suffering through to the end hoping that something magical would happen to make everything half way understandable this film could only appeal to the rare artistically elite filmgoer who finds anything as superficial as character development or cumbersome as plot layout simply uninspiring 
terrible this movie was all action and no story worst movie i have seen in years 
midly entertainitng but a bit off parts of this story are entertaining but parts of it tended to bother me what really bothered me was that harriet did some mean things to people in her class but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong she seemed to tell harriet to pretend to be sorry even if she wasn t sorry that attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
only watch it if you are a brian heidik fan he is the winnner of the latest survivor is in this movie it is barely watchable only view it if you are a die hard fan 
lame two problems first problem let s say you re the typical kidnapper rapistkiller for fun and out of postmodern boredom you kidnap two girls off the street in new york city what are the odds that your randomly chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives or miles away one in ten million twenty million second problem the movie even with a run time of an otherwise short minutes doesn t have enough action or development to fill the void in short it s boring and in several scenes where craven seems more interested in the bucolic wechester county scenery than moving the plot along i found myself reaching for the fast forward 
bloody awful rd installment of the urban legend movies why make more after the nd idiotic movie first was pretty decent but this one is beyond bloody awful people are dying from urban legends because years ago some of the teenagers parents accidently were involved with getting girls drunk and doing stuff to them their kids do it in the now days passing it on as tradition tradition what parent would pass on getting girls drunk and doing stuff to them as tradition mary one of the girls was killed and the person who killed her hid her body now she s stalking and killing the parents kids kate mara tadpole nip tuck and robert vito spy kids d buffy the vampire slayer try to figure out what happened and also try to stop mary and put her soul to rest its pretty formulaic and dumb the urban legends are rendered stupid and nothing is scary about this movie it s a waste of time i know more better horror movies out there then this also starring tina lifford hostage blood work ed marinaro catch me if you can doomsday rock lillith fields day of defense and nancy everheard locust valley csi pretty lame 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
blah blah blah this has got to be the worst film i ve ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i don t have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he s sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i ve seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television notes this film had some great talenta song from olivia newton jon and one of my most personal favorites mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she s to good but why this film she and mila are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this 
nick cage in a bad role nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi 
cult classic please a waste of my childhood i actually saw this movie when i was and it freaked me out abit but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world dont even rent this i dont even know why you are considering the film i only give it a star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since 
not worth i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for bucks and i am so glad that i did that said the first series is worth watching for two main reasons overt lesbianism and jinnai the former is self explanatory while the latter jinnai is without a doubt the best character in the series despite the fact that he is the antagonist you can t say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed out character as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story s main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging and this is what makes the second series all four dismal episodes so tragic they nerfed jinnai he could never have been called a genius in the first series but he was decidedly intelligent cool pragmatic supremely self confident and an effective leader even though he was also manic and delusional in el hazard ii as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain they have turned jinnai into a slapstick idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon i suggest purchasing el hazard through alternate means watching the first series and discarding the second let s face it even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
this movie was very disappointing this movie is strickly for the women now i see why it was made for the lifetime channel it was hard for me as a man to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters i was looking for a happy ending and didn t get it 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
monkey business a dissapointment sadly neither of these actresses were wearing masks in this film what in the hell happened to kelli mcgillis don t expect to see anyone even closely reminiscent of the sensual top gun actress of long ago mcgillis is simply wooden in this role susie porter is somewhat of a toad who appears to be wearing the same outfit throughout the movie s entirety the acting is poor the frequency of obscene language is distracting the storyline is silly and the actresses chemistry is as romantic as a mud sandwich don t waste your time with this one or you ll end up feeling like a monkey 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
there s a reason why the director was assassinated i m a firm believer in freedom of speech but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities the product description listed above is completely misleading it s basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims and then at the end they slowly torture them to death pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen 
harriet is good but the rest of the film i gotta give it to that little girl who plays harriet in the movie she did a great job but i found rosie o donnells performance really lacking which made the film a little boring to watch at times 
dreadful dull disappointing i didn t care for this version at all i thought there was no chemistry between the two leads and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions the story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional brief story of thwarted love the character development especially of jane was missing in action no heartbreak no horror no sense of jane s virtue tough interior and self reliance which helped her overcome so many of life s obstacles not even much atmospheric scenery this mr rochester played by the usually excellent ciaran hines is utterly forgettable weak and miscast he doesnt have to be handsome but he does have to be powerful passionate sexy and seething after all he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy instead try the timothy dalton version which is excellent though now a little low budget looking or the even sexier and faster paced version with toby stevens and ruth wilson which is outstanding and the best yet it moves right along and yet it keeps all the story essentials 
not as bad as i expected but not great either warning movie spoiler below i confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film is grounded in recent history i was around in the early s when l ron hubbard and his scientologists were going full bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like chuck norris or so i thought when all of a sudden hubbard died and the whole project apparently fell apart back then i was close to years old and i was curious about whatever it was that these scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person s quality of life then i read about larry wollersheim s lawsuit you can figure the rest out for yourself anyhow oh yeah the movie the storyline is your basic alien invasion number i e the invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans in this film the aliens look a lot like the klingons from star trek until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the invaders to get off of our planet pretty simple and straightforward but hey there are other films much worse than battlefield earth and they ve taught me that if you have good enough special effects even the lamest sci fi storylines can work the thing that stood out about this film though was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue and as a result it came across as rather corny a film to be recommended for its comedy value rather than for things like epic space battle scenes also the bad guy aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects in order to keep them from organizing revolts i must say trying to depict mind manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a cd it turns it into a confusing incomprehensible mess ! a couple of times the picture would break up into a concentric blur and i d wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on how the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like warner to help them film it is something which will forever remain a mystery to me i remember just before this picture opened a group of scientologists were trying to hype it oh watch this film is going to be bigger than star wars and gone with the wind combined you can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized can you say oops 
dissapointing im a big halloween movies fan while i thought this one would good and unique it was anything but that first of all its very dissapointing to see that the continuation of ho was simply michael myers not actually dying rather fleeing away through some bushes dressed as a paramedic and then jamie lee curtis being eliminated without a follow up at the beginning of the movie paves the way for what is one of the worst horror films ive seen lately the concept of having some people in michael s house is not terribly bad but the fact that they made it so to today s standards of horror films just discredited the whole movie so many characters with pointless roles this whole rapper celebrity trying to fist fight michael myers its just too many elements that don t help i don t recommend it at all if you are a halloween fan you will be highly dissapointed by this one 
a perky american in europe way too much emphasis on hotels i ll devour anything about european travel but samantha brown is a bit too perky and silly for my tastes i can get over that but what really ruins this show is her silly obsession about the hotel she stays at in each episode you ve got minutes to tell me about paris or london or amsterdam and you re wasting of those minutes on a single expensive hotel seriously that s not what travel is all about sorry otherwise a decent production too bad she s a hotel industry shill and she is her great hotels series is sponsored by the hotels she vists guess who foots the bill 
both stars are for d onofrio i too bought this on vhs for vincent d onofrio my only negative comment about his performance is that there s not enough of it ! i ll say right here and now that i m not a big fan of smits or scacchi and d onofrio overpowers them every time he s on screen it s a beautiful story and i can see why director gillian armstrong was attracted to it it is a love story with a bit of real life depth rather than those soapy ones where the ridiculous problems are created by the characters for lack of imagination julia roberts films anyone that being said the two lead roles needed to be played by stronger actors and ones that could keep up with d onofrio vivacity worth a look for fans 
do the right thing avoid this movie i would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible i would say it is self important immature obvious and overwhelmingly one sided it seems spike lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid racist phony or downright evil i had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music then minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words lee had his moments but it was pretty much a hour music video spike lee doesn t mess with fantasy only with reality and his reality is black and white it is infact fantasy and pure propaganda 
doris horror the dvd cover artwork clearly says doris day and cinemascope never had it so good ! and what do warner bros give us a pan andscan version of the film which means we lose exactly half the film cinemascope is pan andscan is shame on you warners shame 
unbox video not yet working will not play once video was downloaded i get the error message can not play file please try again later error x i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed i was told the unbox saturday and sunday hours i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again feb 
boring to watch the actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking the story is too unbelievable too it was a waste of my money to buy it 
boring i know that this film is supposed to be a masterpiece but i fail to see how anyone can interpret this film that way i was surprised to see jeff bridges is such a boring film i found that this film wandered too much in the beginning i watched the first hour and noted that there was hardly any character or plot development ! i found that the movie never really amounted to anything i believe that this movie is not even worth renting ! if someone can explain to me how they could interpret this movie as an excellent one please feel free to e mail me with an explaination otherwise my feelings towards this movie will stay the same addy joekerrthejoker hotmailco 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
crapfest quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time clive owen is really cool but not in this movie angelina jolie s polital agenda totally fueled this film what a waste of time 
the harvey girls review i really enjoyed the movie the story background is the fred harvey restaurants and concessions at train stations my father worked for fred harvey at the chicago and cleveland facilities regarding the movie and judy garland the movie is great and judy was one of my favorite entertainers lane hanse 
too much hollywood hype when i saw this movie as a young boy i loved it i saw it later in life having served years in the usmc and i found it way off the mark i was very disappointed 
unforgettable unfortunately this movie survives in my memory for over years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one rare or better than this one as an example buffalo is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die 
nope i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a middle aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life so he takes a dance class ofcourse there s a fine dance instructor a crush is pursued a wife gets jealous hires a detective and gasp his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just wasn t for me not a bad movie just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance never had contestants who mastered it 
exit the freeway this movie was loaned to me thank god i did nt rent it and is the biggest waste of a few hours of my life ever ! the acting is so horrible it made me cringe and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv this is supposed to be a black comedy it s not funny and the so called violence in it made me yawn seriously i ve seen more gore on the simpsons there are so many things in the movie that are amazingly unbelievable k sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through his neck head and two in the back r witherspoon overpowers sutherland for the second time and strangles him pretty good for a pound teenage girl huh but i do think everybody should watch this movie once so you can see what a movie should not be besides misery loves company 
michael moore is an idiot this was a ridiculous documentary i watched with an open mind and after it was finished i was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view it was ridiculous being that it is a michael moore movie i should have expected this but i tried to view it openly let me warn you now don t waste hours or dollars 
if you need to rent it but do not waste the money to buy it bucks even used at is questionable americans love to elevate certain regular others to superstardom this is true i almost died for derrida watching this film what was with all the incessant following him around how many times do we need to see him walk down the street as if being followed by paparazzi yes we got the point but the filmmakers never moved on probably because like so many of the other reviewers have said here they lacked the depth and knowledge to do so the questions were indeed amateurish and a waste of time the parallel to seinfeld was especially embarrassing and i was pleased to see derrida deflect it by saying that if one was really interested in the matter at hand they wouldn t watch such sit comsand i do agree that the narrator s blandness was most unpleasant and contrived and no this film absolutely did not stimulate my curiosity on deconstructive thinking it only made me want to deconstruct the flaky shallow american filmmakers who made it

good effects bad script i had to say shark attack was a better film and there was only things i liked about this film good special effects i didnt have to see the first one people acually have graphic deaths not deaths that are like cgi graphics id get watch this movie if i had to kill some time thats all i could say 
a really unfunny comedy i saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there ! since i was bored i found myself looking at other people there to see if i could get a read on what they were thinking and after it was over i asked my friend what he thought he said oh it was okay but didn t elaborate so let me it was painfully unfunny with jokes or punchlines that fell flat horrible acting totally predictable and very forgetable this is a movie you might want to rent only if you re really bored and nearly every other movie is out and even then you d be better off to go home empty handed there s not even much eye candy to recommend which is a nice fallback if there s nothing else going for it how people could give this movie anything more than star is puzzling just because you like a movie shouldn t mean you give it stars especially when it s as bad as this one i mean i liked freddy vs jason but there s no way i d give that movie or stars this is bottom of the barrel 
jet s worse film of all time jet lee was dorky in this film and the cholos he was teaching were just as bad this film was made in a desperate attempt to relaunch his career in america after seeing the light jet returned to hong kong and completed the historical once upon a time in china series the rest is history 
the last picture show meets von ryan s express unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone the attempt to make the protagonist milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
mild things lame pun for a lame movie what does wild things have going against it from the get goa no denise richards b no name actors c being a crappy direct tovideo sequel d no denise richards naked what is wrong with wild things after the fact aa script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew b one sex scene a weak threesome one of the few things even linking this to the original c sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked leaving us with a body double and naked frombehind shot wait let me play that again if i seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an erotic thriller did i mention no denise richards 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater i was bored out of my skull after about a half hour my friend who tends to be more progressive than i actually suggested we leave it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing ever perhaps i m biased however i highly recommend that no one get this movie the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant i tend to lean to the right but even i was entertained by v for vendetta despite it being blatant liberal propaganda if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil at least make it interesting 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
negative stars because there were so many great reviews for this movie i decided to go out and rent this film and watch it i was bored to death watching this film and whats with the words whats wrong kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice those words and that voice really annoyed me ! why does this place have not one person with hair now i m not trying to be raciest here but what s with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t v well i can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up what s with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate was he supposed to be gay i guess this film is way to so called artsy for me what i know is that this film is boring and when it comes to ending you don t know what happends to the guy at the end the film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway this film makes the movie the village exciting to watch i wish that i could give my money back 
stupid to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings aren t really too wise he s like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but doesn t really know that much joe pesci s character is pretty annoying that s probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser s character 
stars babies don t scare me babies don t scare me except when i have to change a dirty diaper the storyline of its alive simply did not interest me and i found myself bored bored and bored i don t think this storyline works very well and as a result i think the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie if you want to make this into some kind of a politically motivated flick as a reviewer mentioned above that is fine but that s the only way anyone would be able to read any interest into this plot because the actual movie itself for entertainment purposes is sadly inept 
john travolta and samuel l jackson again so the first thing you need to know about this movie is that it sucks it really does i m not sure who their military consultant was but if samuel l has specialist pins on his collars you don t call him sargeant women aren t allowed in the rangers nunez not my rules ladies colonel styles looks a little young to be a colonel even for the army the army doesn t issue tiger stripe bdu s mueller the list goes on and on this may not seem that important but if you re gonna make a movie about the army you could at least get some very basic soory could t resist things correct yes it s true that there are many twists and turns in this plot but all that really means at least in this case is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay hey if we tell the same story a couple different ways it makes the story really interesting right not so much oh and that scene where specialist west is standing on top of that shack with his pancho blowing like a villains cape wow who decided that was a good idea i don t want to ruin the ending for you because there s no point in even seeing this movie and anyone with enough brain cells to operate the remote will figure out the finale long before it makes its belated arrival by the way how do you follow someone in an army humvee w out them knowing seriously please spend these or minutes talking with your kid s reading a book excercising writing a review i dunno something worthy of your precious time you ve been warned by the way connie nielsen looks hot w short red hair 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
mindless black revenge drama boring racist cop john shaft again the over rated sam jackson thinks that he can break all the rules and beat up innocent people blow up the streets of new york and shoot anyone he wants to well this movie is a bit of something absurd the direction is terrible the action sequences are cliched and the black brother message doesn t really make sense because it falls flat by endorsing to kill all honkeys i would avoid this mess unless of course you are someone who feels that violence is necessary against innocent civilians 
being a french filmmaker only gets you so far this film is pure c p for many years there has been explicit sex used in many mainstream european films it is no longer the novelty it once was there is a point where you don t care about the sex and you just wonder whether the film is any good so yes there are explicit sex scenes here but that s it if you like porn i would actually recommend watching something different because the filmmakers here are trying to make us think that this is an important film it isn t you re better off looking at porn baise moi roughly translated means rape me looks cheap shot on dv and it s a poor man s thelma and louise with some john woo style shootouts thrown in the film isn t intelligent or innovative in the least it is actually incredibly boring and feels like a hour film despite the fact it s only minutes long if you want to see intelligent thoughtful filmmaking on sexual matters rent and or buy catherine breillat s films her films are far superior to this trash 
great play miscast cyrano and a dull flat english translation cyrano is one of the greatest verse plays ever written unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano he s a great clumsy side of beef not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac with the best will in the world his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance the english translation was especially commissioned for this film it is undistinguished prosy and dull it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the s by the great american actor walter passmore get the jose ferrer version this one s a dog 
truth this film was funded by the centeral intelligence agency in the s and was maipulated to suit the need of a capitalistic propoganda machin 
its really just a bad movie leaving aside the painful and horrific real life incident that taints the movie for a moment lets just look at the movie as it is first off i love horror movies some of my faveorites even include ones that are considered bad by tons of movie critics like the first friday the th movies i love most of the nightmare on elm street movies and the first halloween movies and tons others inlcuding yes victor salva s own jeepers creepers whcih i think is the best horror movie to have come out in the last years but clownhouse is just laughable and annoying and terribly acted the bickering among the brothers was driving me nuts for one the characters do so many amazingly stupid things that are cliches in horror movies and they do them often more so than in even the dumbest horror movies peple here have already noted the very cheesy music that takes away from whatever creepiness there is the movie is just plain boring the killings are all dull and lifeless there just didnt seem to be any reason for this movie to exist i mean its barely minutes long ! that is incredibly short for any movie even a horror movie which are usually around minutes plus or minus a few the movie is very lazy at explaining who the killers are we get very little info about them why they are mental patients for one what did they do i mean what is their method of killing or why are they dangerous now that they are loose what do they want money do they just wanna kill isn t it strange that they don t talk at all some people have actually compared this to the greatest horror movie of them all john carpenter s halloween now thats a truley scary thought the movie was also incredibly predictable and took an incredibly long time to finally have the kids realize the killer clowns were in the house and gonna kill them and even when the action finally starts its all too unbeleivable and silly to beleive unfortuneatley i had a rather disturbing and sinister thought about why this horror movie which almost doesnt even feel like a real horror movie to me anyway might have been made apparently victor salva the director had been molesting the young child star of the film nathan forrest winters for years since he was age they had previously worked on victor salva first film a short film some years earlier perhaps this whole movie making enterprise was endeavered just so victor could have even more close proximity with the boy so he could molest him even more perhaps that is why victor made the film its ironic that this movie is about evil clowns because a clown is someone that usually makes kids happy the kid actually has a line about why clowns are fake and shouldnt be trusted its all so weird like was victor trying to get himself caught there is so much incriminating visuals and dialogue in this film that just doesnt belong in a horror movie but well brings to mind kiddie porn apparently victor was also a friend of the kids family for years this movie is almost like victor was bragging about his molestation of the boy using his camera and storytelling skills to shove in everyone s faces his relationship with the boy there is some strange back story in the film that is never really explained that alludes to mental illness that the boy may have been suicidal and tried to off himself by cutting his hand or perhaps wrist its said he has scars there also that the boy may have been committed just like the escaped killer clowns is salva drawing a parallel there why does the child wet the bed at such an advanced age whats his problem anyway its never said but perhaps salva is hinting that hes gay who knows its interesting that the killers dont just escape out of jail they excape from a mental facility perhaps they are really just sick individuals just like the boy is victor salva trying to say he and the boy actor in the film both share something that others may say is sick but that they belong together they say that child molestors search out young boys who they think are homosexual who are one of them the clowns are drawn to the boy yet its also always the boy who see them almost like hes looking for them like they are both drawn to each other i dont know why this film was made so if my theories rub some here the wrong way i am sorry i just cant figure out why someone who would show talent in later horror movies like jeepers creepers would make such a pointless awful and strange horror movie if not for his own perverted pleasure definitely miss this flick and dont be fooled by all the surprisingly positive reviews here this movie sucks 
favorite alice lackluster dvd this is my favorite production of the alice books i love the sets songs and casting it s also very british which i think adds another great element to the mix however skip this dvd edition i got it excited to see alice s adventures in wonderland in widescreen and perhaps a better print than what s previously been available no such luck the dvd appears to be struck from the same crappy vhs version that s been out there for ages faded colors pan andscan in this age of dvd quality like this is such a shame 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
it never happened i can fix this ! this movie never happened now we need to make starship troopers i will contribute a few bucks if we all contribute we can get an actual director to come along preferably the one from the first movie get us some big time sponsors and make us one heck of a starship troopers ! there i have repaired the terrible tear in all our souls that this fake starship troopers caused us all 
this version is a very bad remake of a very good film greetings to one and all just wanted you to know that if you are looking for a pretty good film called the desperate hours this is not the one you want to watch you want to watch the version with humphrey bogart and fredric march this is the remake with mickey rourke and anthony hopkins the original is a taunt drama in which a man discovers that his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by a trio of gangster escaped from prison and focuses on his desperate attempts to save their lives this remake is exercise in terror in which the sadistic violence of the criminals becomes the driving force of the story and the goal is to see how far they will go before they are finally stopped on paper you would have thought anthony hopkins could do a marvelous job in the role of the father but the script pretty much makes that impossible turning the bad guy into a major league psychotic just destroys the psychological chess game that made the original so compelling rourke is simply the wrong choice for the role always coming across as a sick punk rather than a criminal menace but then few actors are going to be able to play against hopkins even when he is in low gear i cannot believe anybody would watch this film twice i only watched it because i was interested to see how they updated the original the ending of which i just watched again on television of course the ending would be more violent but it was the elegance of the ending of the original as the hero saves his family with an unloaded gun that made it stand out this one is just a splatter flick dressed up a bit to fool you go check out the original because like rourke s character you do not want this in your house anywhere near your family 
assistant night manager of illusions maybe it s always nice to watch famke janssen of course but i like it better when she s either a very smart x person or a bond busting sadist this movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh and the bad guy was like an evil version of sgt carter from gomer pyle totally implausible i think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them 
the brat pack comes of age st elmo s fire is one of those movies that could have been better should have been better and yet it just wasn tit featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the s the so called brat pack well everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall who were spared this misstep maybe this was supposed to be the breakfast club after college but while the breakfast club had characters even stereotypical characters that you could relate to there is absolutely no one with the exception of emilio estevez character that you care enough about to relate to in this film the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois but georgetown where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college uh huh yeah right judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage problem is nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy or maybe it s just the pearls emilio estevez is a future attorney working as a waiter server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell mare winningham is a dowdy trust fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her she instead fantasizes about rob lowe who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band who has dropped out of school married a white trash y looking groupie had a child with her and has now separated from her and taking up with other groupies demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking has a serious coke problem stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol sounds promising huh well in what is an early portend of the melrose place to come sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is dumps his ass immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job estevez after screwing up a lucrative house sitting job by hosting a party there travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home lowe in between faux playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere takes winningham s virginity and heads back to his estranged missus moore after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother has all her furnishings repossessed loses her job and freaks out not exactly the breakfast club the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves with the exception of estevez character they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped their every action every line of dialogue seems like just that they seem very one dimensional their so called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that winninghams character could have been salvagable except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was and yet she still gave her virginity to him maybe if winningham wasn t so bright or she was a college freshman it would be understandable but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent lowe really had little to do with his role maybe if he had played the role nelson had as the roving lothario with sheedy waiting at home it might have gone over better with his too pretty looks it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him nelson just doesn t seem comfortable and doesn t pull it off but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player moore basically plays herself an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems mirroring her character but was later rehired while the title song later become a minor hit st elmo s fire itself missed the mark 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
a few laughs here and there private resort is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres however i m sure this film is one that johnny depp hector elizondo and rob morrow aren t proud to have on their resume the movie s plot is slim and neither morrow or depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs but he s not at his best either most of the film s laughs come from leslie hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo dody goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and tony azito as a bumbling hotel security guard there s lots of slapstick some of it works most of it doesn t you can do better folks 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
great movie awful print avoid ! get the more expensive one i have seen the cheap version of this movie on vhs and it is terrible a beautiful mesmerizing film butchered by terrible sound a faded print and subtitles that go off the screen the people responsible for this should be ashamed this edition is truly a waste of money 
language is not russian as stated by amazon but chezh be aware if you don t understand russian and going to follow subtitles this one is for you the dvd quality is perfect im not gonna say anything about the movie lots of reviews here but the fact that amazon said it is russian but it turned out to be chezh made me sad 
bondage scene not complete i just got my copy of the dvd r rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me since this scene is most appealing in the way the original version first displayed it in to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely i was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie if anyone saw the unrated vhs version you would know what i mean lana was the movie why remove it i have not a clue unsatisfied customer 
don t buy this title this title is the bootleg title for a film called the the ratings game i m no sure why amazon is selling this on their web site the quality of this dvd is terrible i was suspicious when i got it the dvd caseand the dvd itself look like they were home made having said all this knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it its like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time i expected more of danny devito 
complete fiction while there has never been a completely factual account of the life of wyatt earp tombstone comes the closest this film is completely fictional first wyatt isn t even married in this version and he becomes enamored with a woman named clementine thus the title doc holliday was a dentist but in this film he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves as a piece of western fiction this film would be alright but since it was decided to use the names wyatt earp doc holliday and the ok corral the entire project is distracting the only accurate facts in this film are that there was a wyatt earp a doc holliday and an ok corral if it wasn t for the excellent performances of henry fonda and especially walter brennen i would have given this film one star 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
worst movie ever please note this movie receives one star only because amazon does not offer a zero star or more appropriately for this film negative rating recently entertainment weekly compiled a list of the worst movie sequels ever how an american werewolf in paris avoided its rightful place on this list is now one of the great mysteries of my life like everyone else drawn to this unfortunate attempt at a film i watched because i am a fan of john landis original american werewolf watched that is minutes which was more than enough time to establish that this sequel should have been stillborn during pre production i was almost tempted to follow this film to its conclusion to see exactly how bad it could get but i simply could not subject myself to such torture the only thing that could make this a worse movie viewing the original werewolf first which will emphasize even more the tragedy that was american werewolf in paris so why was this such a terrible movie i should have taken the dvd case description as a sign it explained that i would be watching a im paraphrasing but pretty close rockin horror film with a hip up and coming group of young actors and even better i would be treated to a soundtrack complete with the hottest of today s music ummno i challenge you to find more blatant lies than the ones offered by the movie s promoters to wit a sample of several idiotic scenes and plot devices tom everett scott wants to prove his courage by bungy jumping off the eiffel tower which would be fine except given the shape of that particular structure going out from top to bottom our young hero would be jumping into the tower itself that might be a problem but one he never seems to consider can we really like a protagonist this stupid just before he is ready to leap a young woman throws herself off the ledge t e scott jumps to save her despite the fact that his rope is not yet harnassed and gracefully nabs her just before she becomes another splatter on the sidewalk she runs off he hey i was right bangs his head on a beam and is put in hospital after waking his concern for her is understandable but why in any rational universe would he suddenly be infatuated with a clearly suicidal woman he says something to the effect that she is different or sophisticated or some other garbage despite the fact that their relationship at that point comprises all of eight wordless seconds here i m also a bit nitpicky because i can t for the life of me fathom why he would julie delpy even remotely attractive mental instability is bad enough but her looks hardly negate those problems anyway for absolutely no lucid reason he suddenly decides that this is the girl of his dreams the entire movie is based on his inexplicable admiration a flaw symptomatic of the entire plot structure the classic scene the young lovers first date in which he accidentally pulls out a handful of condoms and to subdue her anxiety about his intentions he is forced to pretend they are actually pieces of gum yes this is the level of sophistication clearly rampant throughout the movie those are the high points of the first ten minutes and i m fairly certain the rest of narrative is downhill from that atrocious beginning 
another failure with dolph lundgren dolph lundgren universal soldier blackjack plays a man who is hired to take out a primary target and helping him is his old partner gina bellman soon things heat up as the two security guards working at the building they are at start to get fiesty and one of them takes drugs and sees spiders and stuff the are also in a heated romance and get caught in a deadly cat and mouse game of double cross as the agency they are working for want them dead another dolph lundgren stinker vehicle though lundgren can t act if his life depended on it he couldnt pull of he man and the punisher he can t pull off anything else gina bellman is hot but her acting is horrible as well as the rest of the cast there s nothing like being hired to kill people and then have sex directed by russell mulcahy highlander bottom line is this actioner is a borefest 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
awful ok so first lets get one thing strait this is one of the worst movies ever and thats about it ok so i really liked the book and i was excited when i heard they were making a movie of it but then i saw it and didn t even end up finishing it it was soooooo bad they ruin everything nothing is the same and when they go to the giant village there like belly dancing and ella is singing alright that doesn t even sound good but theres a ton of other things as well but it would take to long to right it all down i really sugest that you don t wast your time on this movie its not funny cute profitible not anything except bad its a wast of time to watch this movie 
quite boring the young actor is great in this movie but the film itself is non exciting and a bit boring 
pretty bad another movie using actresses seemingly straight out of soft porn it s fun to watch them die onscreen sure but it s redundant i m not surprised to read it s by the shark attack people they re terrible too but of course if they make a i will rent it knowing it will be stupid ltsighgt 
kids only amazing how walsh after having filmed such great classics could have fallen so low this is a film for young tv audiences if you have absolutely nothing to do on any given afternoon you may find it tolerable too predictible dialogues exaggerated stereotypes plays better with the sound off 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
stars because it made me laugh the absurdity of this movie made me laugh quite a bit the sets were cheap the plot if you can call it that was clunky and the direction stank a lot of people who have reviewed this already are railing on the actors and the only reason i don t is because i have seen most of the main cast the ones on the front cover do very well in other roles it is evident that they really weren t given much to work with if you re looking for a horror flick to laugh at and make fun of in mystery science theater fashion this would be a good one to pick up if you re looking for good sci fihorror look elsewhere 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
contrived implausible crime drama four brothers is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton s increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story reeking of artificiality features mark wahlberg tyrese gibson andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery the quartet launches into action seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced through their investigation in the neighborhood that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first year film student we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith rendering the boys thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best the acting is uniformly flat with the characters little more than wafer thin stereotypes and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second rate given the singleton pedigree in this area the boys running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother s killer is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque with nary a single moment that rings believable or true four brothers is by thebook filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
unclever and unfunny now i am a tough critic so if you re a tough critic read up don t watch this movie unfortunately robin williams is not jon stewert while williams is funny in many roles he is not funny as a political satire the entire movie hinges on his humor which unfortunately falls flat taking the rest of the movie with it do yourself a favor and take the time you would have taken to watch this movie and watch episodes the daily show instead you ll laugh and think more 
see it for drew only the best part of this movie is drew barrymore i really liked her character nina who was so colorful fun flirty and a little schemer this film tried a little too hard to be an quotindiequot film told from two sides it didn t work for me but maybe it ll work for you 
i found it tiresome my advice is to watch this in french which is less painful especially if you don t speak french in english its unbearable slow at one point the dvd froze and i didn t realize it for several minutes 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
big disappointment jane fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful if opinonated remember hanoi jane woman i watched this as a teenager and despite the striptease this has to be one of her worst hormones be damned watching this was a waste of time if you like fonda try klute she was an excellent actress but no one could survive this mess 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
lazy filmmaking i was quite disappointed with this film the director used some non actors to play some of the parts and it shows also the editing and camera work is shoddy in one particular scene you see mouchette turning her body which causes a coffee cup to move toward the edge of the table in the next shot the cup falls to the floor the effect is very self conscious and clumsy finally the actress playing the girl fails to convince us of her state of mind that occurs at the fim s end perhaps other viewers may like it 
a politically correct melodrama a definite stinker waste of money waste of time well known cast amateurish direction plotless politically correct to the point of being stupid the film s incessant attempts at humor fail eric roberts character laughs off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film he is self important godless and emotionally false it s difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts passionate farewell kiss most authentic moment in the film lee grant s reaction to her dying son being carried off very difficult to watch through in one sitting because it s so repetitive and vapid you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments if you choose to waste your time with this film you ll be sorry you did 
so boring it gets bored with itself there are just two rules when you create a thriller with a pretty lead the lead the delectable ashley judd had better show some skin thou shalt not be boring twisted utterly fails on both counts basically judd is jessica shepard a messed up cop who specializes in hunting serial killers she s fond of bedding men she meets at late night bars because she s self destructive only jessica looks fabulous all the time even when she s been on a bender which is apparently every night how she maintains her good looks without stinking up the place is just another part of cinema magic jessica is mentored by john mills samuel l jackson for a second there i thought jackson was going to play an understated version of his usual maniacal self i was wrong things take a turn for the strange after jessica discovers that every man she sleeps with is murdered and she keeps having these weird blackouts every night the victims wash up on the shore the next day with a single cigarette burn on their hand poor jessica is haunted by her parents murder suicide and wonders since her father went on a mass murdering spree before he killed himself could she too have the serial killer gene jessica is paired with mike delmarco andy garcia an italian goomba who is alternately creepy lecherous and like everyone else in this ridiculous movie wants to get into her pants mike follows her around an awful lot could he be the killer or maybe it s the ex boyfriend cop jimmy schmidt mark pellegrino or maybe it sactually i figured it out in the first ten minutes being something of a true crime fan and having read a bit on the subject this entire premise is absurd you don t wake up one day and become a serial killer if anyone actually got a good look at the life of a serial killer it screams danger from day one pretty jessica has none of those problems in her past except for a vague suppressed rage that manifests itself in kinky sex and kicking people in the face her cherubic face shows no signs of hardship and neither does the rest of her although the script wants us to believe she s a haggard cop the camera is only too happy to zoom in on her rear end not once but twice and it s not a naked rear end either so we have a gorgeous female cop who sleeps around yet there are very few bedroom scenes we have a serial killer plot that is connected by red herrings who is that lady across the street why does jessica fiddle with a cigarette but never light it on one hand the cops are strictly by the book they make a big deal out of the fact that jessica kicks a serial killer in the face on the other hand nobody pulls jessica off the case when she s a prime suspect nor watch her home when the serial killer is obviously following her around neither sleazy or highbrow gritty or moralistic twisted is so boring it gets bored with itself 
jeremial johnson a stellar movie i love nature and cowboy movies jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i ve seen it is unforgetable it was my favorite robertredford movie he did very little talking talking in this movie he just acted his best performance ever the movie deals with the american indian also in a profound and touching way this movie is engrossing and based on a true story it s simply the best don t miss the opportunity to see this movie it is a classic it truly is in a league of it s own 
don t buy this widescreen edition don t buy the widescreen edition of this dvd i purchased the full frame version of this movie a few years ago and recently discovered the widescreen version and bought it right away as it turns out this widescreen version is actually just the full frame version with the top and bottom completely cut off to make it widescreen there is no difference between the widescreen and full frame version dvd s except the widescreen has the top and bottom cut off get the full screen version instead 
i was fooled by the dvd art ok though i can t find the actual version of this dvd on amazon com that i own i m going to warn you anyway so i am at the local pawn shop and i see a dvd titled graveyard tramps and it s all colored with black and purple hot topic style fonts and a very attractive goth girl on the front standing in a graveyard now don t get me wrong i knew i wasn t picking up a piece of cinematic gold but i did not get what i expected i expected a modern cheezy low budget film about maybe zombies or just psycho girls in a graveyard goth girls in a graveyard as the cover art depicted i knew it would be low budget i knew it would be but oh well i have an addiction for sexy young goth women so i get home put the dvd in and to my dissapointment i have a s cheese fest about naked better homes and garden type housewives sexing men to death i have yet to watch it past the first ten minutes and that was pretty liquored up so i can t judge if this movie is good or not maybe i ll get comatose and make it through the whole thing i can say the visuals remind me of the original stepford wives sooooo don t be fooled by stock photos and creepy goth cover art i guess that s the moral of this story ! 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
indeed reality bites if this is the generation i am supposed to belong to i want to disown it ben stiller s directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage and are now trying to find their way in the world the movies messege is that we are a lost generation but that is not are parent s fault where this movie tries to lay the blame the kids in this movie are just lazy more or less and they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives indeed troy ethan hawke even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him winona ryder plays waify lelina who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends one day she meets michael ben stiller who is their age but has made a good career out of the tv industry ethan hates him for his honest approach to life and so the battle for lelina s love begins i really wasn t too impressed with this movie it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool tortured artist when they should get off the couch and go get a job 
nick cage in a bad role nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi 
it was whack i had to watch this movie in school today very boring from beginnig to end don t watch 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
imperfect by a mile this is a godawful movie a waste of several million bucks by universal and whoever else was responsible they could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the sexy health club craze of the s actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make lucas or spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so 
one of the dumbest movies that i ve ever seen back in the early s jane march made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit the lover granted the role didn t give her much to work with but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers including me the movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring board into a legitimate movie career unfortunately choosing the unbelievably stupid bruce willis vehicle color of night as her follow up probably killed any chance at a career that she had ive always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre most of the ones that i ve seen while sexually explicit aren t really erotic nor are they thrilling in any way this movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of basic instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar as a result we ended up with some terrible films like sliver jade body of evidence and this film color of night the plot goes something like this bruce willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window going splat on the sidewalk below he is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red he decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by scott bakula and hanging out with scott s therapy group he hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened scott s group is a motley crew of screwed up people from a woman who is nymphomaniac to a weird androgynous young boy bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable jane march and he quickly falls in love with her we get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool the bedroom the bathtub and the shower meanwhile someone murders scott bakula and starts to wreck havoc with bruce he tries to figure out if it s someone in scott s therapy group and on and on and so forth the movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious bruce willis was apparently taking this movie virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances but bruce seemed to think that this might be an oscar contender add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension and add way too many red herrings and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch about the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit but decidedly unerotic sex scenes they really come across as more silly than anything else the only thing that i enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older jane march in the buff and looking better than ever what a smoking body but like i mentioned before she got a lot of the blame along with bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result she has appeared in very few movies since i still think that if she had been given the proper chance she could have been a great actress but people have all but forgotten about her by now its really surprising that this movie didn t kill bruce willis career but i guess if he could survive hudson hawk bonfire of the vanities he could survive anything btw the version i watched was listed as being the rrated director s cut with additional steamy minutes added back into the film since i never saw the original cut i couldn t tell what might have been added back into this version there is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal bruce willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that s too strong avoid this movie like it was herpes color of night is rated r and contains strong sexual content nudity graphic violence and strong language 
super teen having been a teenager once i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however in pump up the volume the movie s attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero well played by christian slater cannot communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he doesn t use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim he treats the caller as someone who isn t serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure but isn t he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry folks been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives as none of these teens do merely escalates the generational gap and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
pointless eric maibus and scott bairstow have become fine young actors and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal pointless lurid and sadistic movie dee wallace stone should be ashamed for participating maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult with no conscience morals or regard for anyone but himself bairstow plays the usual quotmisunderstoodquot teen who looks to the group for acceptance the script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence enough is enough if this is the way teens talk then steer me clear folks there is no heart or soul in this movie and no reason to rent or buy no stars c mon amazon when you gonna give us the stars options 
quality deteriorated desperately needs restoring and digital remastering this movie must be restored the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with bloody mary s singing bali hi i tried to purchase a completely restored digitally remastered dvd of this musical and could not find one in i returned this dvd to the seller 
a politically correct melodrama a definite stinker waste of money waste of time well known cast amateurish direction plotless politically correct to the point of being stupid the film s incessant attempts at humor fail eric roberts character laughs off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film he is self important godless and emotionally false it s difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts passionate farewell kiss most authentic moment in the film lee grant s reaction to her dying son being carried off very difficult to watch through in one sitting because it s so repetitive and vapid you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments if you choose to waste your time with this film you ll be sorry you did 
would ve given it nil stars if i could ve dated derivative self indulgent unintelligent this is truly bottom of the range stuff the acting directing soundtrack and script are all dire none of the characters are even remotely sympathetic in fact i was hoping they d die slowly and painfully i note that billy bob thornton was both star and a scriptwriter methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose an arrogant amoral misogynistic self important coward with zero sense of humour don t waste your time watching this drivel it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase 
weird this movie is very weird and it makes you really dizzy it shows you the end first and then shows you the events that lead up to it not a movie for children at all 
insert pun with word con here con express has lots of action in it which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately the action isn t enough and in between stunt pieces and shoot outs the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions isn t really known for producing films of the highest quality so usually i go easy on them if this were a big budget company producing this i d be inclined to pan it entirely but i wasn t expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is for the most part pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over thetop bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege con air spy game and speed if you liked those you probably won t mind this one too much just go easy on it 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
parents think twice the only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the natalie holloway case about the girl last summer that went on that school trip went off with a boy and disappeared in this movie hilary duff s character is on a school trip to rome meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around rome i felt so bad that disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of natalie holloway in this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded and they didn t even show that part young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie hopefully they will be brough up by good parents that will teach them right to know better than to go off with a stranger in a strange place 
huh i can t figure out which was worse the acting the dialogue the direction or the plot i rented the movie thinking ok a post ww spy thriller with nazi intrigue starring michael caine and directed by john f how could it be anything but spine tingling jeesh what a mistake believe or not caine is capable of giving a bad performance and this was it he just seems lost in this train wreck however he was olivier compared the rest of the cast veronica tennant shows why her career lasted months ! all the others were caricatures of stereotypes that orchestra conductor better be slinging hash somewhere now because acting was not his forte and the dialogue ! caine is supposed to be a foreign born american citizen he of course has as thick an english accent as in every other movie indicating he was brought up on the isle when veronica tennant tells him the umbrella is in the boot she has to explain that boot means trunk in england ! gawd are we all idiots the plot don t even get me started it s absolutely asinine our bumbling everyman is caught up in some meandering travelogue which is supposed to pass for international high stakes intrigue what a snorefest what were they thinking nah they weren t pass on this one folks 
stick with suspiria i already knew before buying this movie that i wouldnt like it atleast it comes with phenomena wich is alot better imo inferno is not one of argento s best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to suspiria i like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work it does have all his imagination but not his style pick it up with phenomena and maybe youll like it but i doubt it 
firefly excellent but buy it on dvd not unbox read the unbox terms of use carefully before choosing this route over a regular dvd purchase it is not your usual set of blah blah legal jargon for example c removal of software if you uninstall or otherwise remove the software your ability to view all digital content you have downloaded to the authorized device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all digital content from that authorized device without notice to you if you ever remove the unbox software amazon may revoke your ability to view the firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine amazon i ve ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience why did you let unbox create these anti customer terms of use 
just not gripping admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it s moments of entertainment but overall it s long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this didn t do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman s silent scientific discoveries completely amusing couldn t wait for the movie to end honestly 
this one will put you to sleep this was a big disappointment not worth it 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok

cigarette commercial this movie is slow boring and poorly acted and even worse it was a constant stream of every actor in every scene talking about and smoking constantly it was so distracting that i could not even finish the movie i mean i am pretty sure the novel did not have pages and pages of characters smoking i realize this is a timepiece but come on who financed this movie phillip morris 
better on vhs this is the worst transfer to dvd i ve ever seen i think the vhs copy looks and sounds better do not waste your money ! 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
bad movie this has to be dolph s suckiest movie i m a huge fan and i own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis but do not buy this movie save your money and buy one of dolph s better movies like army of one or men of war personally though i m pumped for the release of masters of the univers 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
mini screen version of big screen musical i absolutely love oklahoma one of my all time favorites ! too bad the display is reduced to a thin wide ribbon leaving of the screen blank i d really like to see product descriptions indicate the viewing size or lack thereof ! there s no way i d purchase a mini screen marvel if i knew better 
did not receive it the supplier digital eyes told it was available any more they where going to tell amazon to give me cridit for the above item but i have not heard anything from you can we resolve this matter asap thank you to 
no english subtitles there are no english subtitles as it says there are in the dvd features i would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature in dvd movies these days artisan entertainment is just lazy i guess 
don t even bother watching this movie this movie is not at all for a hard core horror movie fan there was was way too much waiting around for something to happen butnothin ever did 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok

great movie lousy video i was when i first saw black sunday it was very scarey and i thought about it nightly for months i think barbera steele was my first love i enjoyed the movie very much as a reminder of times past however the video was terrible the sound was slightly better than terrible i d have paid more for a better quality video i wonder if the expensive dvd has the same issues as the vcr tape 
super awful it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it s one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her 
bedlam the bedlams that greet the current republican administration each morning for usa involvement in iraq have actually relegated this dvd to second rateit is obvious that the producers of this so called documentary are more likely to be fractious to mr bush in particular than accommodating to the american public at large it is also obvious that mr bush is not the type of person to succumb to self pitymr moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though in the meantime i can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind to unfold 
blah i liked the other eisenstein movies that i ve watched alexander nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were american battleship potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by hollywood so i thought i would give this one a try i really wanted to like this movie it s about the russian revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick i could only get to about half way through the movie as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where i stop excellent cinematography and music but i couldn t watch more of it way too thick for me 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
painful ken russell is a gifted director as his erratic career has proved but even the great vanessa redgrave can t save this one the devils a gaudy loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism went painfully awry grisly images of plague victims quack cures peculiar enemas and oliver reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail unfortunately they are merely stomach turning a stocky wild eyed oliver reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as father grandier the womanizing priest of a seventeenth century french town and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake gemma jones is one bright spot as grandier s innocent love interest and ms redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of sister jeanne but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing not for the faint of heart 
basic incompetence by everyone across the board this movie should be shown to classrooms of aspiring screenwriters and directors as an example of how not to be sucked into the hollywood junk machine the screenwriter of this movie obviously had some ideas about a coherent story that he wanted to tell about moral relativity and corrupt military officials this film s story structure is mostly influenced by the classic film rashomon well so what happened how did this ungracious disaster of a movie make it to the big screen the biggest culprits are easily the movie stars john travolta and samuel l jackson using their bloated star egos to force the screenwriter to rework his material into something they ultimately found more suitable to their star personas disgusting ! travolta was supposed to be a bad guy and jackson was supposed to bite the bullet but no way would the two hollywood jerks allow that spoiler alert who in their right mind was surprised by the ending i knew sam jackson was in on it from the get go and soon enough he would grace us with his presence lo and behold his bald head emerges at the end of the movie wearing a white outfit like an angel of some sort i hate this movie it s an insult to the audience ! john mctiernan predator die hard the director of basic should be ashamed of such a lackluster effort on his part but what could he do when faced with the two morons who played the leads ! a sad joke of a movie avoid it unless you just love junk 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
off the formula but still disappointing the rebel withaheartofgoldwholearnsthemeaningoflove scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures which were very popular in the movies and on tv at that time the quoteuropeanquot setting got elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction were basic to say the least and the music was uninspired and badly mixed on record the movie does have one of presley s best set of opening productiom numbers quotlong legged girl quot and others are rousing tunes delivered with that presley panache often missing from his late s efforts but about minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan reaches for a magazine an interesting sidelight is that his co star was a true quotdiscoveryquot an english teenager making her screen debut with elvis presley ! she handles the light hearted assignment very well indeed even the quotold macdonald quot sequence which usually is reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack album cut 
my copy a dud having first seen this film at university twenty years ago i was really looking forward to watching this scary but masterful political propaganda film once again but my copy was a dud about minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies the images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued then the sound froze i had to keep fast forwarding to get through the glitches qa could not have been to rigorous the digital reproduction on the dvd is poor at this point and this continues throughout the whole of the ss review ill be asking for my money back 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
creepy disgusting script harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals and her bright friend s big plan is to set off a smoke bomb incendiary during a school assembly either one will get a kid expelled arrested and in the newspapers not amusing ! then there s golly telling her about the virtues of lying if there is a lesson that could be drawn which the movie misses harriet s secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing because she is showing the sort of behavior that in a kid years older would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self mutilation or bulemia as in the movie thirteen 
avoid this drivel at all costs if amazon allowed zero stars this would get it absolutely awful 
another one of those silly s movies the jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap stick sight gags i normally wouldn t have bought a movie like this but i needed it to make my johnny depp library complete 
unbox video not yet working will not play once video was downloaded i get the error message can not play file please try again later error x i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed i was told the unbox saturday and sunday hours i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again feb 
shamefully bad this is the worst movie that was ever made i d rather move to paris and hang out in cafes debating french politics than watch this movie again it is so bad that it s not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity it is disappointing from every angle in this case the word bad means world class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film i can t even force myself to describe the movie it s not worth the effort i don t like thinking about the movie as i write this what i m really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie are they nuts or just the products of our modern mindless universities someone needs to tell them it s time for their medicine and to stay off the internet

dissapointed i watched this movie in religion and was dissapointed that it didn t follow the book i read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available but now seeing this one again im pretty sure i saw this before i was annoyed at how much it changed the book i think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties the way mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous also i don t like colin s strange fortune teller like air i had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn t even remotely resemble the children don t get this version if your a purist 
two great scenes i will give this movie two stars simply for the two memorable scenes in the movie that make it worth seeing at least once the demon coming out of the tv set scene is suprisingly well done rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like the ring the second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place there s pastel neon lights flashing in the background and the whole scene is jam packed with s cliches it s almost like a cross between the omen a billy idol video aliens and return of the living dead it s so ridiculously absurd and campy it makes me crack up every time i see it 
it never happened i can fix this ! this movie never happened now we need to make starship troopers i will contribute a few bucks if we all contribute we can get an actual director to come along preferably the one from the first movie get us some big time sponsors and make us one heck of a starship troopers ! there i have repaired the terrible tear in all our souls that this fake starship troopers caused us all 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
chaplin classic deserves a better dvd warner must have fell asleep at the wheel with its dvd reissue of charlie chaplin s monsieur verdoux the remastered print is dark murky and virtually unwatchable in fact it s a strain on the eyes ! the additional star is given only for the extras especially the excellent chaplin today documentary this dvd should be taken off the market until warner gets its act together 
exploitation versus art ingmar bergman s oscar winner and wes craven s shocker tell the same tale there is an interesting comparison to be made between ingmar bergman s classic the virgin spring and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired last house on the left by wes craven they share identical plots feature graphic rape scenes and before it s all over turn average men into murderers and yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and s oscar winning best foreign film and the other appreciated only in underground circles but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation so just how different are they not as different as you might imagine but as different as art and exploitation the virgin spring is easily one of bergman s most accessible films telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren t accustomed to seeing a young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy though they initially seem helpful their actions quickly become violent after a graphic for the time rape the girl is murdered later the wrongdoers happen upon the girl s home and seek shelter from her family both groups unaware of who the other is suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought it is a powerful tale of love loss and the depths people can be driven into where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code where savagery and rage take over bergman s film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by max von sydow as the father real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it s a winning combination but what endures in the story of the virgin spring is how strong a component faith becomes when there is nothing left to believe in can you still believe a classic in every sense the virgin spring still has the power to shock but there s something very redemptive about the film last house on the left however is probably more notorious than acclaimed the plot as i ve said is identical coming years later in wes craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale it is a shocker and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the torture cinema of today it is brutal uncompromising and graphic and the film was championed in the underground horror market working with a small budget the film lacks the artistry of the virgin spring while it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock what it lacks is depth and subtlety the characters aren t particularly drawn out so their actions don t have the emotional resonance of the earlier film without contemplating faith and moral choices what we re left with is straightforward revenge and the film ultimately has no redemption no uplift it s violence for the sake of violence it remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it s own right and therein lies the difference between art and exploitation kgharris 
a vain attempt like my title suggests this movie is a vain attempt to take credit from the first movie to sell sub par music to a new generation of viewers the first heavy metal obviously had some thought put into the scenes and the pace of the story line the artistry was phenomanal in the first movie much better than the mish mosh of computer graphics and hand drawn animation in heavy metal the first movie made sure the music reinforced and enhanced whatever scene was being played the second well the music really did not add much if anything at all the movie to sum up boring plot no imagination and a sound track to not die for my advice use the dvd as a coaster and read a good frank herbert novel instead

o k as a die hard fan of lenny who was born after his death i must warn those that in this he strictly just goes over his court problems and doesn t do routines or bits 
don t bother with this garbage i wanted to see natalie portman in what i thought was a real acting role the only other movies i ve seen her in was leon the professional which i thought she was superb in and phantom movie i fail to see how she was nominated for best supporting actress in this movie maybe it was a weak year in female actors she did a fine job but i do not believe it was worthy of being nominated now onto the movie this is basically seinfeld with big name stars a pointless movie that was so slow and no plot i was sleeping through half the movie and i lost interest after the introduction of natalie s alicejude law did the best job in this wretched film he pulled off the loser character and failed author mentality i don t get this movie or why it was even made but i am not into similar movies this movie supposedly about people who lost love or was in love no i don t think so there was no love in this movie it was lust pure teen age hormones running rampant all it lacked were true teenagers the chemistry lacked between all of the characters except between the characters and i did not believe in them other than that for a brief moment i did believe in natalie s alice and jude s dan oh well i guess i don t understand this movie at all but i also didn t care about them the characters were despicable and annoying like seinfeld oh yes there were many wasted scenes such as the photo shoots scenes who cares why bother showing that as funny as the internet chatting scene between dan jude law and larry clive owen it was almost as meaningless certainly it was far too long the producer director and scriptwriter should be knocked over the head with such a bad movie i don t blame any of the actors at all they tried their best in their limited functions in this garbage that said natalie portman needs to use her talents and beauty in better roles

garbology main line main line those main liners you like to look at those main liners don t you ginger i mean kitty you the suffragette who just got offa the suffragette wagon the same wagon that was seen rolling by in the story of vernon and irene castle wait a minute that was the exact same footage ! i guess the makers of this fine movie assembled it out of stock footage in fact wynn the main liner seems to be assembled out of stock footage of bill clinton did you know allabout the maiiinnne liiiiinnneee seems the whole worl knows about the maiiiiiiinnnneee liiiiiiinnnnnneeeeeee philadelphia aristocracy see in philadelphia they re old skool dig they even got a queen of pennsylvania who sits on a throne and stuff played by margaret dumont when she s not getting scandalized by groucho marx and i believe there is a duke and duchess of bakersfield and just the other day i had tea and crumpets with the viscount of compton of the night train i mean wild i i mean yeah he was drinking ripple back when redd foxx was merely the duke of cornwall he was in line to the throne or was that waiting for the mens room see over here in the states we take our aristocracy just as seriously as our prussian counterparts we are always to be seen marching around with those spiky helmets on saluting the statue of kaiser bill s moustache 
the book is better this film is based on one of my favourite books so i was really looking forward to seeing it despite great performances by blanchett and fienes it just doesn t hold together well too much of what is in the book has been left out and that which is there lacks weight the characters in the book are so much more complex and endearing the book was very moving and engaging while the movie is not there is also an ending tacked on that doesn t exist in the book and that always annoys me i was very disappointed i think had i not read the book i d have stopped watching the movie about into it 
most disappointing dvd transfer what a shame this dvd transfer is so aweful because the movie is great i have seen this movie before on sbs tv australia and have been wanting a copy since but this dvd looks like a transfer from an already poor quality vhs copy very disappointed 
a bit plodding but funny series of reversals a woman who lives in an apartment in nyc and can t cook and doesn t have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about she writes a very popular domestic advice column she succeeds until a navy hero wins the opportunity to spend christmas with her in her house in connecticut enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby problem is she doesn t have any of those things she borrows the house from a man who wants to marry her she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house and she even borrows a baby the unmaking beings when she tells the navy man her child is a boy and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it s really a girl then the mother of the baby takes it back and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one then the woman is falling in love with the navy man and he with her while the man from whom she s borrowed the house still believes she s going to marry him and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding its a delightful movie very funny and rich in both plot and character development unfortunately what probably makes it not a classic by today s standards it is a bit plodding it does not move at the same pace as for example the movie casablanca with which it shares some of the same supporting actors 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
big bird too whiney i bought this dvd for my daughter who is from china and though i think xiao foo is adorable i am disappointed by big bird s behavior not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way but he tells barkley at one point to sic the monkey king and then later again frustrated tells the monkey king to put his dukes up as if to fight to resolve the issue i am appalled by this big bird is also somewhat demeaning to the chinese people he encounters they don t understand him because he is speaking english and rather than explain the language barrier he just gets upset i love sesame street and although i will keep this dvd to hear xiao foo sing in chapter our daughter just loves her i feel i will need to use big bird s behavior as an example of how not to act 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
for die hard kutcher fans only the movie starts off very slowly with childhood episodes from ashton kutcher s character it s at least an hour before we see the adult kutcher although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene the premise is good and it has some good momentum in the middle which is why i gave it two stars the shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done but the overall story line is very weak and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story also the movie has too many tongue incheek references to kutcher s real life circumstances such as the reference to tightywhities they distract from the story and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle which is too bad if you are not a kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie skip this one 
it left me rooting for stalin a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era but what can one expect there is at least one great movie to be made about that era dont look for it here 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
disappointed the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
wild orchid please more like withered orchid after two moon junction and weeks i expected a lot when i watched wild orchid last night unfortunately i was extremely disappointed i don t mean to imply the movie is totally awful or the worst movie ever made it s not but the movie had nothing unique about it at all and lacked a certain something the expression when you got it you got it holds true to movies and wild orchid didn t have it its not mickey rourke or carre otis fault their both attractive people who seemed to try hard with the material on hand but the material just wasn t interesting it lacked subtlety the worst part of the film is the horrid trite dialogue im afraid if i touch you you ll disappear if you want me come and hold me right now you ve got to be kidding me zalman king should learn to quit while he s ahead take a look at the red shoe diaries for example the same story recycled multiple times shamelessly using david duchovney to draw viewers because it wouldn t attract a single one without him or at least none out of high school and not desperately looking for some late night nudity this film is the same it uses weeks and mickey rourke to draw viewers even though it can t stand on its own feet because it s so unoriginal and poorly written never mind the acting what was bruce greenwood thinking wild orchid held neither the fascinating complexities and characters of weeks or the dreamlike imagery and compelling mystery of two moon junction it was just sex it held none of the sensuality of the above mentioned it s too bad because there was a lot of potential there it was very much a letdown in this case what you see is ultimately exactly what you ll get just don t expect anything more then that again i wish this movie had been made differently the main word that comes to mind when viewing wild orchid is typical 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
wild orchaid this movie was not good at all other than it has beautiful people with real nice bodies everything else is a waste of money and time 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
boring overrated i never saw this film in the theater so i can t be completely sure that this is how it s supposed to look but assuming that the dvd transfer is accurate i find all the praise for kore edas painterly visuals completely undeserved the film is shot entirely with natural light so in the daytime indoor scenes the glare from windows and doorways blots out or silhouettes everything and in the nightime indoor scenes everything is murky and underexposed it all looks horribly amateurish the outdooor scenes come off somewhat better but slightly grainy overall almost as if they had been shot on a digital camera cinematography and possible bad transfer aside there s also the matter of kore edas excessively static direction i can appreciate the still quiet camera work of ozu or jarmusch but kore eda takes this style and pushes it to ridiculous lengths his camera never moves not even for an occasional cut or panning or tracking shot it just sits there dull and inert while the scenes drag on and on and then abruptly end almost arbitrarily i guess this technique is supposed to impart a contemplative effect to a scene but again it just seems amateurish the performance by fashion modelturnedactress makiko esumi as the grieving young widow yumiko reflects the director s numb soporific visual style instead of being quietly torn by grief she comes across as merely affectless maybe the director wanted to use a zombie like non actress and comatose camera work to convey the numbness of grief but the result is far from edifying or moving or even interesting the ultimate effect of this movie is only stupefying boredom 
soo frusterating i think i am the only one that hated this video after reading all the reviews i was sooo excited and rushed out to get it however i just could not figure out how to do the excersises ! it was soo confusing frusterating and the most boring workout ive ever had in my life also the instructer just got on my nerves she was so annoying this is probably just me as judging from all the other reviews no one else had this problem but check it out from your local library and see if you can do it before you buy it just be prepared to be bored out of your mind 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made the book made a huge impression on me years ago i fell in love with the story and was envious of sam s year in the wilderness last night i found the movie for sale at a local book musicdvd store i vaguely remembered that my side of the mountain had also been a movie way back when but i had forgotten all about it i bought the movie and my wife and i watched it ugh this movie was a waste of time it was poorly written abysmally acted and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book my wife and i got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn t like hunting or killing of animals reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad killing animals being bad and even frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport so sam never got his deerskin outfit as he did in the book instead he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter at one point near the end when bando returned to visit there were so many people in sam s hollowed out tree that i could have sworn it was a magic tree much like the magic tents in the latest harry potter movie small from the outside but huge on the inside what an awful movie even the cinematography was horrid if i had to watch frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time i might have shot her myself avoid this movie at all costs but please do read the book it s one of the best children s novels ever published 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
favorite alice lackluster dvd this is my favorite production of the alice books i love the sets songs and casting it s also very british which i think adds another great element to the mix however skip this dvd edition i got it excited to see alice s adventures in wonderland in widescreen and perhaps a better print than what s previously been available no such luck the dvd appears to be struck from the same crappy vhs version that s been out there for ages faded colors pan andscan in this age of dvd quality like this is such a shame 
excellent performance very poor video edit as other have stated the performance is excellent my wife and i watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show with that said my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did they used some kind of filter on many of the shots they change camera angles times in minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch you do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music i have to sell my copy because i get nauseas watching it i hope they re make this dvd i think my year old daughter could do a better job editing and we could use the additional revenue stream 
unbox video not yet working will not play once video was downloaded i get the error message can not play file please try again later error x i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed i was told the unbox saturday and sunday hours i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again feb

yawn i bought this dvd because it features alan rickman i also purchased it because of someone else s amazon review they sounded like they really knew what they were talking about i am glad i bought it used because if it were new i would feel that i d been cheated the movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor s office there was no sense of suspense and i was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea mind you i m not the type who requires non stop action and special effects to be happy the dialogue throughout was tedious and trite the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line as well as the director and the editor the plot was in some respects totally illogical and at other times nonsensical even previous scenes don t tie in neatly enough at the end the plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible the choices the characters make whether restless bored frustrated don t tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film like a greedy unwashed vampire the movie features a wealthy bored couple i was also bored but i m not wealthy however all the actors did their best within the limitations of this film polly walker was very convincing as a sensitive but hypercritical wife in fact i d say she provided the best performance and her character was the most three dimensional and human they should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character norman reedus was fairly genuine as the young man although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive he failed to grab my empathy which makes the plot of the movie more implausible that a jaded wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment alan rickman did his usual subtle work but it was so subtle that i thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming his attempt at an american accent did not fly too well later in the movie however he becomes much more interesting the end lacked passion and was not surprising at all it was entirely predictable for rickmanistas yes you get to see alan naked so just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy i have always admired alan rickman i m a big fan but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted directed film so i give it two stars yawn 
attempts to be provokative turns out ultra violent gore the ideas behind minutes aren t bad at all take one robert deniro put him in new york mix him with some american dream hunting eastern europeans on a killing spree and try to provoke some emotions and have a sly dig at the american justice system lets see nothing happened only repulse if like everyone else you plan on watching this film because deniro is in it you will be dissapointed he puts in a tired performance almost as if he knows the film is a load of b s the attempt to be hard hitting goes horribly wrong instead it s just repulsive over the top violence and its pointless naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces why there are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning such as mm the horrible subject of snuff movies hard hitting meaningfull film minutes is far from meaningfull we all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that but when converting it to a film it needs a deeper meaning otherwise it turns into melodramatic hollywood if you like brain dead gore and violence lack of plot and cringing melodrama go ahead 
disjointed sadly it could have and should have been something instead it is nothing more than a mess joe unger and the actor who played the perverted gas station attendant with the white film over one eyeare very good this however is hardly enough to recommend the flick 
boring to watch the actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking the story is too unbelievable too it was a waste of my money to buy it 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
plot holes the first half hour of this minute movie is actually quite good in fact it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don t know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates she was however but we the audience don t know that however the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam is unexplained especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin however it turns out she isn t so that s why the movie lasts longer than minutes fortunately we re not dealing with unwanted pregnancies either so this doesn t turn into a soap opera however we do have the dreamboat hero who dreams up the rumor about her being raped and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that s true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film dreamboat takes the turn as lead character and it s his story we re following whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film and basically it s her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out dreamboat and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out and everyone else in a way the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth though the characters don t have the same truth in mind it s about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it s not the comic book variety isn t fun for an audience it s just distasteful in other words the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first half hour and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved it might be worth viewing if only once but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that s the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip or in this case deliberate lies is that what goes around comes around and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first min then quit midway but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once just to be sure where this is headed 
avoid this bootleg this dvd is a poor quality bootleg the real u s title of this film is master killer but the original title is th chamber of shaolin a company called celestial owns the worldwide copyright on all shaw brothers movies their digitally remastered dvd has been available for a couple of years and puts this bootleg to shame that catch is that you must purchase it from a hong kong based web site amazon is not allowed to sell it so they have listed this bootleg find a hong kong based web site and purchase the official dvd 
very irreverant remake of a disney icon i am appalled at the greed that disney must have to milk out a classic like the absent minded professer i found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie i found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by robin williams and marsha gay hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that s throughout all disney movies or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves i also feel that with the character of flubber it was a waste of time considering i don t remember any merchandising from the character they should ve stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original i also feel that with the promotion of the flubber substance that it was all shallow and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military and here it was to make a buck i feel that there are some movies that are best to just be left in original state and not be remade and this is one of them 
just a bit too much barry longyear s story is perfect this movie could have been but what was that bull at the end with the whips and factory slaves and that stuff they should have ended the movie as the story ended and not added that last bit that totally ruined the movie for me the novella and its sequel at least give humanity the benefit of a doubt the war is over and there is an uneasy peace and humanity if love doesn t prevail at least strives to be better in the movie they made humans brutal savages in the way they treated the dracs did we learn nothing from the usa s foray into slavery and brutality it seemed that a violent ending was gratuitously grafted onto the movie to make it more palatable to the year old testosterone crown thereby destroying what could have been as perfect a film as the novella was perfect but when has hollywood ever gotten it right they usually find some way to shoot themselves in the foot 
u won t care for this one sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the u boat men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of u boats machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful 
worst bond movie apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film but when i re watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so i found it to be well nearly unwatchable whats so bad about it well how shall i begin sean connery is a dud there can be very little doubt that connery is the james bond but here he seems like he s just going through the motions to be fair he had no decent material to play the only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging he seems suitably worn out at various points and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before but these are grace notes by and large connery is stiff as a board here the action scenes are uninspiring i m not the biggest fan of the roger moore bond films but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes here the action is strictly second rate kim basinger and barbara carrera though great to look at give terrible performances there is literally no reason to see this in favor of thunderball of which it is a remake the original remains one of the all time great screen entertainments and this remake makes zero improvements in fact the plot merely becomes muddled there are a series of awful performances in supporting roles rowan atkinson s comic scenes though brief are painfully unfunny not to mention out of place the actor playing the new m is odious and whoever it is playing q isn t very good either the music is bad the title song is boring and the score by michel legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a bugs bunny cartoon i couldn t care less that the james bond theme is missing it s not what isn t there that s bad it s what is there all in all i d have to say that unless we re counting the version of casino royale this is the worst of the james bond movies it s worth seeing if you ve never seen it before but that s about it in my opinion 
heartburn is the least of the ills caused by this movie a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron s husband jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull 
not worth i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for bucks and i am so glad that i did that said the first series is worth watching for two main reasons overt lesbianism and jinnai the former is self explanatory while the latter jinnai is without a doubt the best character in the series despite the fact that he is the antagonist you can t say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed out character as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story s main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging and this is what makes the second series all four dismal episodes so tragic they nerfed jinnai he could never have been called a genius in the first series but he was decidedly intelligent cool pragmatic supremely self confident and an effective leader even though he was also manic and delusional in el hazard ii as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain they have turned jinnai into a slapstick idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon i suggest purchasing el hazard through alternate means watching the first series and discarding the second let s face it even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
exciting concept dud follow thru the concept was a dream for monster fans combine werewolves frankenstein shuler hensley jeckel hyde and dracula with bram stoker s vampire chaser van helsing adapting van helsing into a young man with hugh jackman to play him then feature lots and lots and lots of dracula s brides screaming through the air against green screen and miss out on many possible expositional scenes one of the few movies i ve wondered when it would mercifully end and i m a hugh jackman fan my son and i kept saying but why didn t they show not tell and my daughter inlaw shrugging it was what it was what it was was a mess when the tv making of feature was more exciting than the film houston we have a problem read the book instead 
big name cast adds up to unfocussed dud the worst movie of this genre incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad ! this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much as can be said for keifer sutherland and others that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies 
didn t recieve it i never recieved this item if you could look into it for me i would like to have it thoug

thirty frames per second the visionary art of the music video not exactly what i was thinking the title is misleading the text is unreadable the idea is good but who care to see picture of actual video it would have be nice to have video made of this book waste of time try to read it

watch the bird with the crystal plummage giallo instead i waited ages to get this fulci classic and now i wished i did not it is probably fulci s most confusing work to date and lacks all known production standards considering this is film from him i can buy giallo being a bit spaced out and highly far fetched but this one is just plain bad from start to finish it is only really remembered for the infamous woman chain whipping sequence chain whipping also appeared in the beyond fulci loved cashing in on all this stuff dont torture a duckling is completely void of substance mystery or crime and instead is replaced by everything that is camp about film making from the obvious papermashy heads to the shall i stand here and act now type blemish on everyone s face considering this is fulci s rd film or thereabouts it really looks like his first and it would be another years before he made horror i was expecting a somewhat smart giallo and got drawn out rubbish instead like i said watch the bird with the crystal plummage giallo instead it was made by argento two years before this and is where you should be at instead i would recommend that argento primative slasher over fulci s cash crop schlock dont torture a duckling any day of the week 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
predictable movie gorgeous holt mccallany i love holt mccallany so anything he has done will naturally catch my attention he is the lead in this movie which is pleasant enough to watch despite not being particularly extraordinary the story is simple and a bit predictable but the acting is decent and if you are a holt mccallany fan like i am you will love him in this one especially the way he looks absolutely sexy ! 
gobble gobble the dvd for fascination has a great cover and makes you think this will be a romantic film set in exotic locations there really was only one beach location which probably helped cut down on the budget klaus menzel s direction lends a sputtering pace and made me feel the picture was going downhill as it changed from romance to attempted thriller james naughton from s the paper chase first wives club devil wears prada plays the father whose swimming accident casts an early shadow over the film adam garcia plays his son scott garcia has been in a number of films including bootmen coyote ugly confessions of a teenage drama queen however i didn t quite remember him nor would his rather wooden self absorbed performance and his flat vocal affectation be likely to make me recall him from this film however he does a good job in the bare bottom love scenes scott s mother is lovely jacqueline bisset who has had a long career since she first claimed fame as giovanni goodthighs in casino royale back in and went on to work with francois truffaut in day for night she has golden globe nominations with the most recent being in for joan of arc she does a good job as the mother maureen who has an affair that turns into her second husband unfortunately her taste in men does not improve as husband appears to be on a revenge mission for husband who let husband s wife drown in short the plot is a bit contrived and confusing with more twists and turns than common sense husband is oliver vance played by stuart wilson from the prisoner of zenda wild things lethal weapon enemy of the state as the bad guy he is overbearing and a bit revolting his intimacy with his adopted daughter turns him into a real sleaze merchant his adopted daughter kelly has the most confusing of roles confusingly written although actress alice evans does as good of a job as possible with this why a girl who survived the streets of johannesburg decides to try to jump out of a car at the end of the movie didn t make sense to me such was the bundle of contradictions of this character how could she allow herself to be used by her stepfather why would she still feel allegiance to him the only real answer is the screenwriter wanted her in the movie and that s how she arrived evans has worked in national lampoon s blackball my wife maurice dalmatians this role will hardly catapult her onto hollywood s a list the actors bravely stick with this turkey that does have some nice love scenes one tropical location otherwise you ll be wondering how much longer until it s over the alternate ending apparently had garcia dead so i m glad they picked the ending they did taxi ! 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
this is supposed to be a comedy but where s the proof this isn t funny it isn t well directed or scripted perhaps it could have been great if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director but it didn t so it turned out mediocre at best unfortunately i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i d read this was going to be a brilliant hilarious cult classic but now that we ve watched it he and i both know better we know it s dreadful and i can only imagine all the nice things i m going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we d seen one of the actors in the movie before i m pleased to say i won the argument that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me in my opinion this is not a hilarious cult classic as others so often describe it i don t know how drunk i d have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie or to find it even a little bit funny but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i d need a stomach pump afterwards if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci fi classic pick up a copy of flash gordon that has great actors great sets wonderfully campy scripts brilliant humour and a soundtrack by queen furthermore it has stood the test of time and is still great today unlike the ice pirates which has dated really badly better yet get hold of some red dwarf dvds seriously red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it s so good it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies 
makes plan from outer space seem like shakespeare what a great cast ! i mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie right after it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it although you are shaking your head in disbelief ! stunning ! you ve never seen anything quite like it ! if you are a fan of the campy awful you may see it as a masterpiece if not you will still have a unique viewing experience proceed at your own risk ! borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it did i mention the great cast so many of my favorites even goodman can t save this clunker 
possibly jamie lee s worst every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor actress in it that everything will turn out good blue steel is one of those movies jamie lee curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties or should i say murders which she did not commit sounds like an interesting plot right it would be had the script not been so poorly written the supporting actors give such a bland typical performance that not even jamie lee could have saved the dialogue aside from the acting the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop jamie lee is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her so why do i give blue steel an extra star well i ll just say that if you are a fan of jamie lee curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television just don t pay over to rent it and certainly don t buy it 
beautiful boy pretentious director this picture is a mess of misused metaphors and confused imagery from start to finish i was left scratching my head wondering who these people are and why they behave the way they do forgive me for expecting the film to provide any answers first the good news if you like beautiful boys ricardo meneses as the twisted sergio is one of the most gorgeous creatures to ever stand naked before a lens despite the hopelessly confusing script his acting such as it is is amazing especially if you take into account his age and experience his first film it s too bad he had to be discovered by a director who thinks nothing of making his audience beg for each scrap of insight and pretentiously expects the viewer to read their own interpretation into whatever nonsense he sees fit to set up as his next scene i wanted to give it the benefit of a doubt so after sitting through one screening of this erotically charged but confused tangle of a movie i sat through it again this time with the directors commentary on cheating i know but after shelling out all that money for the dvd i was hoping to gain some idea of what the hell was going on i emerged from watching it the second time half in love with the beautiful young actor ricardo meneses but with only a fraction of the respect i had for the director joao pedro rodrigues after my first screening and that wasn t much sergio is a garbage collector for the city of lisbon he works a graveyard shift with an assortment of other oddballs and in between collecting garbage he has a series of sexual escapades that seem impossibly jaded for one so young while other boys his age are swimming or surfing he s dressing up in a full body suit of latex having anonymous sex in men s rooms including the most explicit act of fellatio i have ever seen in a non pornographic movie and exploring s m adventures with any willing male he can find just so you know how kinky he is in one scene he masturbates in the shower while strangling himself with the shower massage cord you really have to wonder where all this imagination comes from until you realize that the writer director has been harboring some pretty extreme sexual fantasies about his friendly neighborhood garbage men sergio has a female co worker who is in love with him but she s busy having sex with the foreman and sergio s only interest in her is to tease her sexually and then play cruel jokes on her he finally meets a man who doesn t succumb to his charms because he s obviously straight this was not the first or last thing in this film i didn t get when i was that age and almost as pretty as sergio i understood that some guys just couldn t be had so i shrugged my shoulders and moved on not our sergio he takes obsession to unheard of heights especially for an year old he stalks the young swimmer goes through his garbage and steals his torn old swimsuit of course unrequited sexual obsession in films is not exactly new remember reflections in a golden eye in that film made in and still considered by many critics to be one of the ten worst bombs ever made the male object of marlon brando s desire was almost as pretty as ricardo meneses but that film had the advantage of a script that was at least coherent at times in one of the first of many explicit sexual encounters in o fantasma sergio while walking his dog comes upon a policeman handcuffed and gagged in the backseat of a patrol car he proceeds to masturbate the cop to orgasm leaving him tied up in the car and then running off to work where he spends the rest of the night sniffing his hand and licking the residue i was hoping that the director s commentary would maybe explain how and why the cop is tied up in his own squad car but his sole comment on the soundtrack is you don t understand in the film why the cop is handcuffed excuse me mr rodrigues but i didn t understand it in the audience either sergios only tender scenes are when he takes care of the dog a mascot of the sanitation workers in one scene sergio is busy cleaning the dog dishes and doghouse with a hose when he turns and sees the foreman standing in the door he pushes past their faces register some indications of conflict and then the foreman shuts the door the director s commentary on this action is the door closes and you know what will happen but you don t see it uh no i m afraid the relationship between sergio and foreman is the least developed of all the underdeveloped relationships in this film so what will happen next is anybody s guess not that i really cared sergio is the only character in the script whose personality is even partially explored and all we ever really learn about him is that he s sexually compulsive and kinky to the max the picture goes on endlessly with sergio refusing to let go of his obsession for the young surfer swimmer until he has the most excruciatingly slow breakdown ever recorded in a movie at the same time what little there is of coherence also breaks down the director s commentary infuriated me even more when toward the end after spending most of the commentary praising the cooperation beauty talent and maturity of his young lead actor he proclaims it is cruel to say it but he wants to continue acting and i think he will not act again i will not use him in my next film its like his body has been used up i haven t had the benefit of seeing anything else by mr rodrigues but if given the choice of viewing mr rodrigues next film or ricardo meneses next appearance i think i d opt for the beautiful boy any day after botching the attempted kidnapping of his beloved obsession sergio takes off to spend the balance of the film wordlessly running the final scenes treat us to a guided tour of the sights sounds and by way of commentary smells of a garbage dump as sergio wanders through the dump clutching a live rabbit he finds among the garbage i saw the rabbits there says the director on the commentary so it s believable the director grasping for a final metaphor remarks he is like a cross between a bug and an insect a comment that seems to me to be a cross between the idiotic and the insipid he then ends this drivel after the slowest twenty minutes of film i ve ever sat through by more or less telling us he didn t really know how to end it like i hadn t figured that out a full ten minutes before the end credits started running as sergio continues to stumble on into the dawn before the final fadeout the director says i could bring him back to the city but that would not make much sense the idea of a scene that might not make much sense didn t prevent him from filming the other minutes of this drek i dare say he should have gone for it 
why why someone tell me why someone e mail me and explain to me why there is nothing to gain here nothing to be learned nothing to excite no story why seriously is there any documentation that might explain why this thing not a film exists return of the texas chainsaw massacre is so unprecedented in it s poorness that it doesn t even succeed in being a dumb slasher flick let me reiterate the filmmakers actually failed at the least complicated genre in the book if i wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere i would have rented week end the only reason to see this is that ever crafty curiosity value yes you will be compelled to watch if only to observe some clue as to why both matthew mcconaughey prea time to kill and rene zellweger prejerry maguire accepted the lead roles the clue never comes texas chain saw fans will of course feel the completist need to see this the death knell of the series and finally i think just the concept of leatherface as a shrieking cross dresser will garnish a few bewildered viewers but believe me folks this still doesn t answer the ultimate question why why why 
stars for the dvd and not the movie i just purchased the disc special edition of this movie and here s my problem sfirst off i don t speak italian so my only options are to watch the film with the english dub or with the italian dub with the english subtitles but here s the problem the english dub is out of sync with the film sometimes being only slightly so but other times being very noticeable and distracting ie during loud sound effects such as a chair being knocked over or someone knocking loudly on a door and so my other option is the italian bud with the english subs but here s the problem with this the english subs are missing during the scene where peggy is reading the diary about minutes into the movie now i had noticed missing subs during the first part of the film but these where usually during background conversations or occasionally a line would be missing from someone s speech but could usually be figured out and these where only slightly annoying but the missing subs for the diary entry is inexcusable and is also missing from the other subs as well as this is an important bit of info to the plot of the story also when you set up the audio option from the main menu there s no problem but i found that if you use the audio button on your dvd remote the italian option gives you the french soundtrack and the french gives you the italian one it s nothing serious but it s an annoyance all the same so does anyone else notice these problems or did i just end up with a bum disc

amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
waste of time i got this film because i m from detroit where this takes place it s a pretty typical revenge flick four brothers want to find their adoptive mother s killer usual smartass remarks guys talking bs fights shootouts blah blah blah i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch this script was mediocre at best give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe 
don t buy this title this title is the bootleg title for a film called the the ratings game i m no sure why amazon is selling this on their web site the quality of this dvd is terrible i was suspicious when i got it the dvd caseand the dvd itself look like they were home made having said all this knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it its like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time i expected more of danny devito 
lost in the re write i assume that at some point this project had a much better script than the final one in order to get william hurt and others involved i ll hold that in my mind as the only way they would get into this mess it has action and special effects enough for movies but the plot is all over the map and never congeals into anything special with the talent and money that they must have had this is one poor excuse of a movie 
aims low and hits its target this straight tovideos modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison this prison only seems to house about inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it s resolved in much too pat a fashion however leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around and there s a torture scene modeled on the one in lethal weapon in which he s hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks mr thomas performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell 
does anything happen in this movie so this movie is made of stories the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting so this thing ends and the movie should have also it should have been a minute movie so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs wow what a movie the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day she was fun to watch but i still wish i wouldn t have seen this dumb movie 
what s all the fuss about before i review i d like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show and so i figured eventually i d have to get around to seeing the movie which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they re both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name which i have not read so i don t know which is more accurate but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way there are many things i don t like about this movie the biggest being poor pacing the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler but that s the biggest problem there s not really enough story to last a full length feature because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a minute short and since they didn t have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes there are barely any and they aren t very impressive for the most part they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won t understand more than of and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we re looking at either nothing or a woman s nipples that s not cinematic artistry that s being either lazy or perverted the animation itself isn t even that good especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only years ago it s choppy and there s not really a whole lot of detail except when it comes to women s nipples looking at just the animation if i didn t know better i d have thought this movie was an ova from the sthe only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell it s probably kind of like how i didn t see the batman movie until years after i d been spoiled by batman the animated series and couldn t bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman everything about the tv series is superior to this movie the animation the stories the character developement the production values i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is in short if you re you re at all interested in the gits franchise do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead you ll find a lot to love but i can t say the same about the movie my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex

attack of the totally fake and unconvincing sharks how many modern day jaws rip offs do there need to be well ! okay this film i would rank lower than stars if it wasn t for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist the other reason was i think casper van dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him but this movie stunk in no ways does it compare to jaws nor even deep blue sea i hated almost every moment of it if you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy deep blue sea or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years don t be fooled this is a waste of time and effort this film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none 
it watched it on fast forward except for two cuties william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard on 
another blight on the franchise the original halloween was the greatest horror movie of all time since then a series of inferior sequels were released one after the other some were watchable such as halloween and one was actually pretty good halloween h but most were terrible drivel halloween was a let down halloween was an abomination halloween was a crime against nature and halloween the curse of michael meyers was perhaps the worst movie ever made then halloween h came out and surprised everybody it was good ! could this be a trend to revive the dying franchise unfortunatly the answer is no because ho was followed with resurrection which effectively sank the franchise back into the depths of its own miserable oblivian 
uncle tom s cabin review by trish new a catalyst for the civil war uncle tom s cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves the book s literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the african american s pain despite being redundant rube and rife with tautology the story is about tom a slave who saves his master s daughter and is promised his freedom but his master dies before tom is actually freed the family falls upon hard times and tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named simon legree legree tried everything to degrade tom but tom holds firmly to his religious convictions 
poor terrible all around bad movie don t waste your time 
ugh thats what i got to say about this piece o sheeitt when i bought this together with the first one for that kick a price i thought i was going to watch the sequel of all sequels i thought big huge offensive against the bugs how can you go wrong well they somehow succeded poor acting garbage special effects retarded plot man i can go on and on whats wrong with this pile of trash but the other reviewers already did this so i ll just be beatin on a dead horse please if you loved the first st do not watch this it will put a bad taste in your mouth 
horrible quality black screen with only voices the showing of dora goes to a black screen shortly into the screening this was a waste of money i will never download unboxed items again as they are not good quality don t even bother just buy the dvd 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
these were real people people i waited over years to see this film and now that i have i m glad i waited that long its glaring defects might not have been so obvious to me years ago nicholas alexandra their daughters their son the people surrounding them not only are they not fictional but thanks to the era in which they lived they were photographed we know what they actually looked like so who on earth did the casting it was impossible to tell one grand duchess from another and as for alexandra in the first few scenes i had trouble distinguishing the actress from someone in drag janet suzman was the worst casting flub of all unless you count the stilted manner in which michael jayston delivered his lines what a stiff and boring character he makes nicholas to be yet there are photos extant of nicholas smiling as he played with his children nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as tsar but in the robert massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled it was very clear that nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the russian people as well as to his family and above all his son the future tsar there was nothing exceptional about his behavior most of europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens and to all of them the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable yet this film falls into the trap most of us do of judging history not on the basis of its own terms but with our usual spectacularly accurate hindsight having been fed soviet propaganda for years we have it entrenched in our minds that nicholas was an extremely poor ruler that s the stunning success of the massie book that someone who had absolutely no connection to russians and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia was able to overcome the general and erroneous knowledge of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking the movie on the other hand makes nicholas look petty and alexandra slightly over the edge one petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to nicholas s sending off his troops into world war i it was badly researched to the point of ludicrousness the tsars of russia were all orthodox christians orthodox christianity has its own very distinctive music in fact russian orthodox chant is very different from greek orthodox chant so what kind of background music did the director choose gregorian of course ! can we at least strive for a little authenticity apparently not massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the romanovs towards their captors how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the bolsheviks you aren t anything like what we thought was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject the movie showed nothing of that well in the end it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the romanov family canonized in the russian orthodox church that movement was well underway by i wonder if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures all in all purchasing the movie was a waste of money maybe the bolsheviks over at the university s russian department will appreciate my donating it that way others can get to see it without wasting their money 
bad porn the setting of this film is in the late s just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the vcr and the subsequent explosion of pornographic vhs tapes burt reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be artistic in his craft heather graham plays his psycho starlet and mark wahlberg plays a porn star who is welllets just say endowed wahlbergs character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of wahlberg s character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to john holmes although i don t know if the film makers would admit as much at any rate he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his package this hubris leads to his un doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and lots of shady characters this sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie well it could have been but all the way through there seems to be something missing there are times the film seems to try and convey a message but i m not really sure one thing i do know is that i quickly remembered why i ve never cared for wahlberg he has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt also i was expecting a lot more skin than what the film delivered given the context of the film one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women that s simply not the case in the end however the biggest problem of this movie isn t wahlberg or the lack of nudity the difficulty is that it s just plain boring i have more than a passing interest in the history of porn and yet this flick failed to grab me 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
a stellar book a disappointing movie my boys and i read my side of the mountain together for our homeschooling lessons i can t tell you how much we loved the book ! jean craighhead george does a remarkable job of taking the reader deep into the wilderness of the catskills complete with reference to washington irving s rip vanwinkle we were delighted by each and every page why in the world any screen write would change such a marvelous creation is beyond me ! the movie wasn t even close to the novel and we felt like it was a complete waste of time to watch i can only wonder what the book s author must have felt watching a washed and clearly faded rendition of her creation she must have been deeply disappointed the book itself would make a wonderful screenplay all its own we truly hope that someone will resurrect the story and put it on the screen in all its glory until then this movie is not it ! save your money buy the book ! 
not as bad as i expected but not great either warning movie spoiler below i confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film is grounded in recent history i was around in the early s when l ron hubbard and his scientologists were going full bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like chuck norris or so i thought when all of a sudden hubbard died and the whole project apparently fell apart back then i was close to years old and i was curious about whatever it was that these scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person s quality of life then i read about larry wollersheim s lawsuit you can figure the rest out for yourself anyhow oh yeah the movie the storyline is your basic alien invasion number i e the invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans in this film the aliens look a lot like the klingons from star trek until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the invaders to get off of our planet pretty simple and straightforward but hey there are other films much worse than battlefield earth and they ve taught me that if you have good enough special effects even the lamest sci fi storylines can work the thing that stood out about this film though was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue and as a result it came across as rather corny a film to be recommended for its comedy value rather than for things like epic space battle scenes also the bad guy aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects in order to keep them from organizing revolts i must say trying to depict mind manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a cd it turns it into a confusing incomprehensible mess ! a couple of times the picture would break up into a concentric blur and i d wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on how the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like warner to help them film it is something which will forever remain a mystery to me i remember just before this picture opened a group of scientologists were trying to hype it oh watch this film is going to be bigger than star wars and gone with the wind combined you can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized can you say oops 
good idea poor acting as much as i would like to recommend this movie i have to admit it is not one of the best movies of jesus life it does follow the text of matthew s gospel essentially word for word which is at times a useful tool that said the acting is mediocre bruce marchiano as jesus is a flop he just doesn t pull it off convincingly i often teach a class where i show people clips from different jesus movies marchiano s poor acting often evokes laughter in the group if you what the best jesus movie ever done nothing beats zeffirelli s tv mini series jesus of nazareth the two other parts to this series acts and john are done very well

aaron kwok gives a great performance in this silly cop movie kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever he looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good unfortunately his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad i won t explain the story it is cops vs drug dealers there is a beautiful fighting female good car chases big name stars and good fights how did this movie go wrong well stanley tong is a decent director but he is a stuntman screen fighter and martial arts choreographer at heart he tries to make this an american movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies i cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film i have seen in a long time usually i am able to get past all of this since i am a sucker for good fight scenes and this movie does have a few highlights to watch for are ken lo vs marc dacoscos and dacoscos vs everyone in the final fight the thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie cradle to the grave has a better end fight ! stanley tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale coolio ends up as the main opponent not ken lo who is the leg fighter that faces jackie chan at the end of drunken master and not marc dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors but coolio i honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie but the final fight sequence is just horrible stanley tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight it is just too bad coolio had to ruin it dvd from dimension home video has good sound and picture quality no special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie

poor terrible all around bad movie don t waste your time 
was expecting much more i enjoy watching teen movies because i m ever so curious about how the director sees this particular age group and the misconceptions present in his view as much as in the teens view of things this movie is unlike most teen romantic comedies i ve seen and not necessarily in a good way first of all the main characters are unlikeable and don t represent actual categories of people in real life we have the good looking rebel who s actually not so rebellious after all but then gets back to his old ways stupid twist if you ask me the nerd who can t get any they picked the worst possible guy to play the nerd he s actually pretty good looking and a funny guy the nerdy girl who hasn t grown up yet ends up hooking up with the rebel but they break up the gay guy i have no idea what his role in this movie was the aggressive victim of child abuse the freaky nympho with a tint of lesbian what the hell were you thinking daniel waters and finally the rebel s childhood best friend who falls in love with him and is rejected the film focuses about minutes of its total on this character i don t know why she s even here she has no obvious role and her situation doesn t reflect at all in the real world next up i think the director is sexually obsessed or something ok i know sex is an important part of a teenager s life but this movie is about lame year old girls aching for sex and even lamer year olds who have nothing else better to do if i wanted to see hormonal imbalance i would go watch discovery channel there are more important things in life than sex and this masterpiece definitely doesn t illustrate them the characters thoughts and actions are limited to the camp itself and the director focuses too much on useless stuff and tries to create stereotypes but fails miserably most teen movies have a moral side to them they teach the audience certain values unlike happy campers this movie only taught me that it s so cool to be obsessed about sex it s cool for year old girls to think they re oh sohot women that only the absolute best looking guys hook up not true in the real world and more also the director makes completely ridiculous situations seem normal such as the camp leader getting hit by lightning and then acting completely weird the counsellors buying boxes of condoms theres only so much sex you can have in days the whole donttouchme todd thing and so on and so forth this movie isn t worth the i paid to rent it those who think this is better than the american pie series should go out more american pie was a work of art this is a piece of 
total garbage this pile of steaming crap is one of those message movies that comes across as pretentious self righteous nonsense there is a big difference between the quality of a movie and the message that it attempts to convey powder may be trying to convey a lofty message but i assure you that the presentation is laughable and just plain stupid the only people that could possibly take this dog excrement seriously are those individuals that like to sit around and brood that nobody understands them a terrible terrible terrible movie 
it s the great glass elevator charlie quick what s not in widescreen and has no special features that s right megalodon ! sixty feet of prehistoric terror or so claims the box art this film may be about a shark but the production is all about frankenstein seen jaws how about the abyss alien reptilicus deep blue sea deep star six or leviathan then you ve seen most if not all of megalodon it s all here the high tech multi billion dollar drill site a small but the best at what they do crew the ill timed major storm snow and ice an ill crewman a lost world filled with lost fish stuffed with lost magalodons the standard crew roundtable scar sharing scene a spunky blond girl reporter and her husky semi comic cameraman tiny one man one woman subs a helicopter crash several tragic deaths all capped off with a whiz bang explosion at the end which solves most but not all of the problems megalodon takes no chances by leaving nothing to the imagination it simply takes no risks which is odd since it tries so hard to move in another direction all the time there s a good story here blocked by a very large shark the magalodon doesn t come into view until halfway through the film and up until then you may find yourself wondering when they re just going to get on with it but once the shark does arrive does get into frame you begin to realize that there was something more building here weve seen the destruction of the environment used time and again in these kinds of films it s a backdrop it s something for the creator and builder of the worlds biggest and deepest oil rig to ravage and lay waste to but here the head of the colossus is actually a pretty good guy trying to provide the world with the fuel it needs when they stumble upon the lair of the megalodon there is no talk of drilling for more oil they all are taken by the wonder of finding a lost world it almost seems as if the story might breakaway here and follow a different direction but it never does the shark swims in knocks things about knocks things over breaks through things and then gets blown to bits we skip into a three months later get our coda then our stinger that there is not one but two perhaps more megalodons now loose in the world s oceans nifty but dull there a ton of unanswered questions and by the end you know the movie has cheated you can anyone explain why the earthquakes were needed in this film also was the anchor cable drilled into the ocean floor ever going to break they cut back to it at least three times after each quake and i kept waiting for it to snap and the colossus to tip over never did megalodon is what it is full screen ready for cable jammed with a few nifty ideas and stuffed with off kilter cgi the subs looks fake but look clean while the megalodon itself looks and acts almost exactly like a plastic tub toy shark effects not the best not the worst not jaws or any of the rest its megalodon and it s available for sale or to rent

boring tacky watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled boring and tacky even by horror standards the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet hence the title i ve seen far worse but those worse movies were more quotenjoyablequot than this the following morning you probably won t remember having seen it if only the monster had eaten this movie s negative then we would all be spared 
dont t get it this is the worst of them all not all that funny and no weed jokes it s a waste of time and money get the others and start laughing your ass off 
terrible terrible boring movie i am a lover of japanese movies i even purchased a masterpiece sadakan no for for a vhs i have a huge collection of japanese jems so i know what i m talking about heck i m even japanese myself but let me tell you maborosi must mean major boring this movie can be condensed easily into minutes and probably be still too boring yumiko is traumatized as a kid as grandma says she wants to go away and die please stop you are too young to die but grandma leaves anyway and yumiko dreams about this repeatedly yumiko has a hubby and kid and hubby commits suicide she mops throughout the movie from start to finish she wears nothing but black and rarely smiles and sustains a flat affect a totally unrealistic movie in real life yumiko would have to worry about getting a job and pay bills rather than worrying about her psychological traumas because she has a kid to take care of her husband was some kind of laborer the movie is dreadfully boring boring boring boring it goes into trivial daily life and irrelevant conversations and becomes the whole of the movie with very little plot it goes on and on and on making you sleepy sleepy sleepy masterpiecehow on earth it s another example how winning an international film prize does not necessarily mean it is good now if you have problems with insomnia or need a sleep remedy please by all means purchase this it s hard to follow only because it puts you to sleep sooo well ! i m not exaggerating if you decide to purchase this boring movie and believe the hype of the critics as it is highly overrated well i warned you thank you

why does jet li star in wong jing films this film has been re released as meltdown there are a few reasons for watching this movie jet li chingmy yau the reporter wu ma frankies dad a decent fight scene at the end jacky cheung is also not as aggravating as usual that s it jet li has appeared in three or four films directed by wong jing and just as chow yun fat does in god of gamblers and jackie chan does in city hunter he does what he can the direction of the film however as well as gog and ch stinks the plot copies die hard and speed with some broad satire aimed at jackie chan but that is not the problem put simply jackie chan knows how to direct a film wong jing does not if you want to see jet li go see fist of legend once upon a time in china or just about anything else he has done if you want to see a good hong kong action movie watch films directed by john woo ringo lam tsui hark jackie chan and sammo hung jet li is fun to watch but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this 
why did they bother i am a van damme fan and still hold out for the day when he makes a return to the big screen i bought this recently and now wish i hadn t unfortunatly with this entry it seems van damme has decided to self destruct what remains of his career i hope he made this during his drug addiction years if not then i think he has received one to many kicks to the head and should consult a doctor very predictable throughout which by no means is a bad thing if only the film was enjoyable and didn t treat its audience as if they were year olds logic seems to have been thrown out the window along with the two page script rent this before parting with your hard earned cash if only to see the fight scene in the lapdancing club ! van damme has shown some glimmer of hope with desert heat and replicant but i think the good old days of kickboxer timecop universal soldier and sudden death are long over 
avoid this bootleg this dvd is a poor quality bootleg the real u s title of this film is master killer but the original title is th chamber of shaolin a company called celestial owns the worldwide copyright on all shaw brothers movies their digitally remastered dvd has been available for a couple of years and puts this bootleg to shame that catch is that you must purchase it from a hong kong based web site amazon is not allowed to sell it so they have listed this bootleg find a hong kong based web site and purchase the official dvd 
cuckoo many bright talented artists and mel ferrer came a cropper with this inert misfire hudson s novel was probably unadaptable during the studio bound s perhaps now with the current emphasis on location and a suitably ethnic cast a more satisfactory version could emerge though in any period the mystic aspects of the narrative would be tricky to manage properly but the mgm treatment while a labor of love for the ferrers produced one of hepburn s few flops seemingly doomed from the start any film that prominently features anthony perkins audrey hepburn and a fawn is just too twee for most mere mortals in fairness hepburn gives rima the old college try but as in the unforgiven her refined diction does her in between her finishing school vowels and her innate chic this child of the jungle would fit perfectly in mayfair even audrey s simple linen shift on her looks like the hautest couture dorothy kingsley s dialogue doesn t help much this is the kind of movie where savages noble or otherwise don t seem to have yet discovered contractions throw in a wasted supporting cast although hayakawa and henry silva frequently lend their native hut the air of a particularly louche bar in tiajuana futile attempts by katherine dunham and villa lobos to elevate the proceedings a strong contender for most ludicrous title song ever warbled by perkins and you ve got a real curate s egg too earnest for camp perhaps green mansions main point of interest for today s hepburn fans is that in many of the more successful moments of her work as rima her speeches to her late mother and her final love scene with perkins for instance you can get a pretty fair idea of what her tony winning broadway turn as giradoux s ondine must have been like audrey s ever enchanting but this time as part of the problem herself she simply can t rescue a dud 
not good just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i m a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging 
bad audio track the performances included are good but one can not hear the music that the performers are skating to the music is at a very low volume with some female talking very loudly over it telling that they just did a quottriple something quot that amateur commentary was not necessary and is very distrubing the audio quotengineerquot if you can call him that and the producer of this video should go back to high school and enroll in freshman audio visual 
the tommyknockers got ahold of this movie and put their own little spin on it going to split this into reviews one based on it from the book the other just based on the movie in general the book the tommyknockers is set in the town of haven maine where strange thing s start to happen to the townspeople after bobbie anderson find s a large mysterious object in the woods behind her farm curious she starts digging it up and with each shovel full of removed dirt open s up a terrifying and life altering experience for all those involved the movie based on the stephen king novel starsi watched the movie after reading the book my own personal rule and though at time s felt like they were true to the book was often left going huh at the changes that were implemented certain thing s are left out while replaced by hollywood s cheap imagination the missing teeth as well as the batteries and inventions running off them never really hit home and though the book had a multitude of characters who had important part s of the story we see some simply vanish and never make it to the mini series perhaps the tommyknockers got to them first ! since it was a miniseries and ran over hours there was no reason to chop and hack this thing up and replace it with alternate scenarios and a different ending i was disappointed to see how hilly was found as well as the fate of gard and the ship and marge s ultimate destiny comes out differently as well the movie in general without comparing it to the book starsmargie helgenberger and jimmy smit s do a very good part cast as bobbie and gard the overall pace of the mini series roll s along well and the production and directing is okay the sound is good and set s the mysterious mood that the town of haven is faced with disappearing people mysterious inventions run off batteries and a mob like atmosphere are all displayed as we wait to see who the tommyknockers are and what exactly they want with the townspeople of haven an excellent cast overall considering the many various character s that had to be portrayed in the story 
dull brass interesting only because it was made by europe s premier exploitation director kitty is tedious and has pretensions to being an expose of the nazis this film is nothing more than a forerunner of the italian genre that flourished briefly in the s as to the controversial and perverse elements they are clumsily handled and pointless you ll find more readily available elsewhere and the horror of the nazis is presented much more graphically and forcefully in movies by speilberg and polanski to name but two if you re interested in a more thoughtful attempt at controversy from italian directors with better artistic credentials you might try seeds of evil and pasolini s salo days of sodom 
not a sequel just another werewolf movie for those that waited all these years for a sequel to the classic american werewolf in london the wait is not over american adventurers looking for thrills across europe decide to bungy jump from the eiffel tower but there is a beautiful woman who is going to commit suicide by jumping one of the boys jumps to her rescue but her secret is she is a werewolf and accidentally infects him well it turns out that there is a pack of werewolves in paris and they feed on americans lets talk obvious stereotyping while at times it is good especially when julie delpy is on screen dont waste your time watch the original ! 
wanna sleep watch robot monster by phil tucker my wife complains about falling asleep mid way throughmy favorite tv series voyage to the bottom of the sea either it was carb overload from hotdogs for dinner butrobot monster by phil tucker had me stumbling and writhing in more pain in my couch than my herniated discsjust to stay awake and at least get my money s worthsince it was a netflix rental its all true the dialog was corny and special effects as valuable as the u s dollar after depreciation since the highlights were does ro man want a date with alice andthe camera focusing on how to solder a radio set to communicatewith the leader of ro manbut don t take my word be like me and see for yourself justhow really bad this movie is you wonder if this movie was madeby idiots trying to pass for amateurs 
creaky charles laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised but it s lumbering and creaky with heavy handed theatrics typical of the early talky era i found watching this picture very heavy going 
an exercise in film making not a film roman polanski whom i m none too big a fan is quoted as saying people like truffaut lelouch and godard are like little kids playing at being revolutionaries and i think that quote sums up shoot the piano player fairly well it s an exercise in film using new ideas concepts such as the scene where we don t follow charlie but instead follow the woman leaving the apartment room but in the end is a vapid hollow piece of art like a norman rockwell painting or the work of andy warhol upon initial release the film was torn apart by the general public critics alike but now some years later it s considered a landmark film one of the most if not the most important of the french new wave a movement cited as being the biggest influence on the american cinema of the late s and early s but simply because it was influential doesn t necessarily stamp it s place as flawless everything about the film is fantastic the acting the music the cinematography and yes the radical ideas truffaut used are inspiring but it s not enough to save a film that is utterly meaningless the thing about the french new wave s effect of american cinema is that american film makers took their ideas added a layer of depth to them they were more than just oh let s try this weird shot it ll be experimental the movement on numerous occasions has been compared to jazz which i can understand but don t agree with with jazz yes there s a free flowing improvisation but there s something there than just pretty pictures ideas that would be considered absurd by the standard audience s mind a fantastic example of a scenario where the influence was greater than the original is john cassavettes whose killing of a chinese bookie has the feel of a french new wave film but is also a fantastic work of art 
don t let go of your old copy this is a mixed blessing star is for the dvd stars for the movie i don t need to say anything about the film those familiar with bava s work know this is among his masterpieces i m writing this review to clear up some things about this new unslashed edition on the positive side this version is anamorphic widescreen and it does present noticeably more picture information on the right and left sides of the frame the old vci version was leterboxed a where as this one is x now the bad news the color and contrast have been boosted altered to the point that the image appears blurrier grainier and more damaged than the previous version also the interior sets especially in the fashion house have a putrid yellow green hue to them not present in the old version the soundtrack is horribly remixed making the dialogue sound like it was recorded in a tin can and it pops quite a bit through the opening of the film the french and italian audio channels are reversed none of these audio problems are present on the old version by the way to top it off the dvd menus are gaudy and offputting trying to make this seem like a bloody slasher pic in summution the extra picture information just doesn t outweigh all of the drawbacks of this edition my advice is to hold on to your old release until something better comes along thanks for reading jwh 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
nothing like the book although this movie is based loosely on the book the hour and a half it runs for gives no time to explore all of the nuances of the book s extraordinary adventure i loved the book which was well written and thought out but the movie has basically butchered christopher paolini s great fantasy novel to do a movie like this the time frame needs to be similar to lord of the rings another hour or so and this could have been a good movie the only reason i gave this two stars is for the dragon and jeremy irons rent if you still want to see it don t buy 
what a waste i have to say that even though teti hatcher s performance was good the movie itself was terrible the plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable i can t believe i wasted my money on this one 
missleading and incorrect this movie is entirely fictional and is not based on true events first of all the great saviors family was killed by muslims and so he chooses to go killing some muslims in a completely different country that in in itself shows that the director hates muslims and limits all muslims to being bad the other thing is the way that he portraied bosnian muslims main causes killers of the war which is a complete lie the serbs goal was to eliminate the whole bosnian muslim population and create a dominant ethinc group the serbs ofcourse also he forgot to mention the attack on srebrenica where serbs killed over civillians in just one day i just have to asume that the director loathes all muslims as he completely lied 
a promise is a promise it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment considering the makeup of the cast nicolas cage bridget fonda and rosie perez among others the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning million dollars on the ny state lotto decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day the acting is surprisingly below average the dialogues are way below average while the plot is not bad at all nicolas cage s character is too naive and too slow and that was just sad pitifulbridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland rosie perez s character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing they don t seem to belong subsequently they are not convincing in their roles at all finally somebody shoot the narrator please though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really no masterpiece here if nicolas cage is what you had in mind check out the amazing movies city of angels and or the family man 
horrible do not watch this garbage ! this is the worst movie i have ever seen i m honestly upset with the other reviewers here for misleading me so badly this film is so bad with so many problems i don t know where to even begin i can only hope that someone on the verge of watching this changes their mind after reading this review if i saved one person from buying watching this disaster then i have done my job at the very least buy it from the used bin that s where mine will be 
believe it or not it s terrible the year the cast peter sellers peter o toole woody allen ursula andress the soundtrack burt bacharach tom jones dionne warwick manfred mann the movie believe it or not terrible really as in unwatchable other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits painfully unfunny slapstick routines actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards and no plot to speak of not even fun to watch for s camp value like the party or casino royale i had to turn it off at about the halfway mark grade incompletesafest bet get the soundtrack skip the movie 
dull and unrealistic this film tried to do too many things at the same time it was an attempt to portray life in sarajevo under siege the plight of its citizens the efforts made by foreign aid workers the misadventures of foreign journalists etc in the end it failed in all of these aspects except for the actual documentary footage of the notorious bread line massacre nowhere did this film adequately convey the horror of the war even though based loosely a true story welcome to sarajevo was largely unconvincing the direction and production were poor and the actors generally seemed to be going through the motions thus in most scenes in wartime sarajevo the various characters seem to act as though they re stuck in some provincial bus station rather than huddled in shelters to keep from getting hit by artillery shells or sniper bullets in some ways it almost seems to romanticize life in the city during the siege although you ll have a hard time finding any sarajevan today who looks back on those years with anything resembling fondness another troubling aspect of this film is that it tends to take a very condescending and self serving attitude it s basically up to western reporters and aid workers to save the children of sarajevo rather than the efforts of the locals although the intentions of the producers may have been noble welcome to sarajevo is a misleading and condescending film 
not the original version this has already been expressed here in the reviews but just as a reminder one more time this dvd is not the original version the original version has more material and is much better hopefully someday they ll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
soundtrack intolerable i found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that i had to quit watching this after about of the video the movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise about a the sound of the singing was very grating harsh to my ears since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible it also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content the photography art direction were exquisite 
nice idea but when i came across this movie two key words caught my attention vagina director s cut i love gabriella hall but this movie is kak it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed lots of nudity but not that erotic it looked too cut for a directors cut i did not enjoy the movie the key words did not do the trick 
so so i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it s cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in it ain t that much better on a whole 
like almost totally gross although valley girl came out when i was a teenager it somehow eluded me until now i bought it because of the favorable reviews and of course for the sheer nostalgia i won t say it s a bad movie but i would compare it directly to the last american virgin in terms of screenplay story and acting unlike the last american virgin however this film has an awful sountrack and it didn t really end in a notable way from a filmmaking standpoint this seems amateurish apparently this is where director martha coolidge cut her teeth because she went on to direct the remarkably good college film real genius just two years later the big problem with this film is shallowness we never learn much about any of the characters so it s not easy to care about them i still can t figure out why the lead characters were attracted to each other since the only way they ever describe each other is hot they never engage in deep conversations or share secrets with each other there s no depth to the relationship at all another problem is that all the high school students in this film appear to be about years old while the sexy mother of one teenage girl appears to be under years old herself a whole subplot that revolves around the mother beth played by lee purcell is unsatisfactorily resolved about half way throught the film then never mentioned again even so i like her temptations a lot more than stifler s mom in american pie lisa foreman s lead character julie behaves less like a valley girl of the s than she does an ordinary middle class teenager living in overland park kansas if you re familiar with moon unit zappa s song valley girl you ll find almost none of that kind of language in this film nicolaus cage s character randy is likeable enough but he looks more like a member of jefferson starship than a punk his almost mullet like hair is blown upward on top thats it unfortunately for an odd couple story like this to work you need to emphasize the extreme difference between the characters but these characters could have easily been neighbors from childhood they don t seem at all from the other side of the tracks the obligatory montage scene fails because it continues for the entire length of the song ill melt with you a montage is meant to compress time and dragging it out for an entire song defeats that purpose they should have faded it out after seconds for more effect the most entertaining characters in the film by far are julie s parents a couple of former hippies who were obviously the prototype for berke lander s parents in the hilarious teen film get over it the soundtrack too is terribly inferior to the last american virgin and doesn t represent the early s well at all only the aforementioned ill melt with you stands out as a great song meanwhile a tune that repeats the question johnny are you queer seems oddly out of place at a preppy high school prom from a nostalgia standpoint i didn t feel like i was watching an s movie at all in fact the most pleasant nostalgia in the film was seeing ashtrays on every table even though the characters didn t smoke which reminded me for the first time in years that california was once part of a free country and wasn t always ruled by neurotics frankly i was surprised that the orwellian thought police hadn t airbrushed all those ashtrays out of the film today every surface in california is littered with a fear mongering proposition warning stickers instead i m so grateful i was a teenager in the s rather than today overall this film fails on too many counts to recommend it but i wouldn t blame you for checking it out it s good enough fun for minutes the special edition dvd adds quite a few features that make the dvd worthwhile if you can get it cheap ! 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
stick with suspiria i already knew before buying this movie that i wouldnt like it atleast it comes with phenomena wich is alot better imo inferno is not one of argento s best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to suspiria i like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work it does have all his imagination but not his style pick it up with phenomena and maybe youll like it but i doubt it 
it scared me too years ago i just read doug s review of first man into space and i just had to write respond i was seven years old when i saw this movie as i recall though my recollection here may be faulty it was double billed with tom thumb one of my good friends had a birthday party and we all went to the movies first man into space scared the bejeezus out of us we were so scared we couldn t stop crying they had to take us out of the movie in the middle sometime after the car was pulled over by the state trooper i thus never saw its conclusion a few years ago i found the video of the movie and i triumphantly brought it home to show to my teenagers needless to say they made fun of me throughout the movie dad you were scared by this 
hasn t this been done much better before let s be frank shall we this mock sci fi is just one more take on cant we all just get along how transparent dress up the black guy in a silly rubber suit and pretend he s an alien involve him in sports ! there aren t many films that make me curse out loud but this is one of them treacly and brain dead beyond endurance the only thing that might have saved it would have been a spirited rendition by poor gossett of it isn t easy being green one of the other reviewers mentioned lee marvin and toshiro mifune in hell in the pacific i couldn t agree more that film essentially the same thing is immeasurably better do yourself a favor skip this exploitive garbage and watch either hell in the pacific or some genuine science fiction 
unwatchable save your money i gave up halfway through and shredded the dvd amanda peet was great in saving silverman but she should be mortified by this movie whipped was probably written by two fifteen yearolds on their junior high lunch break absolutely abysmal 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
the thief of bagdad this was awful i m sorry i spent a penny on this 
im the guy in the frozen food section dialling i swear peter segal s anger management is a film with nothing going for it it is best described as boring annoying and devoid of laughs mildmannered dave buznik adam sandler is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding he immediately develops a problematic relationship with buddy rydell jack nicholson the self help expert leading the sessions as the two men spend more and more time together buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling anger management just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like it is essentially a one joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly sandler and nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker furthermore the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings truth be told anger management is one of those projects that was green lighted because of the talent involved and not because of its quality 
free to be you and me as long as you are like me i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my s days in elementary school this video made its rounds in the public schools the songs are catchy and the film quality is good but make no mistake this is propaganda aimed at children i will not be showing it to my kids despite the freewheeling title the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys case in point atalanta a princess finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world on her father s horse she also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of ladies first the tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron the narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal our hosts infant puppets voiced by mel brooks and marlo thomas are revolting there should be a law against using mel brooks voice for a baby apparently i repressed memories of these creatures but seeing them again brought back the horror needless to say i fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry overall this dvd is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
bogus one of the worst movies ever this stuff must have been made up and total lack of common sense makes this movie an amatureish comed 
no teeth to this one maybe i was just expecting something like jaws but i didn t think this movie that great i watched it twice now only because i kept falling asleep the first time the script is very weak and thus so is the story the acting is flat most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from existing documentaries i have seen photographs of at least one scene you can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for the movie are very poorly done don t waste your money if you want to watch it rent it don t buy it 
modern marvels rollacoasters only got five minutes of show when downloaded ! most of it was comercial for modern marvels it say s show should be minutes ! 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show

profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much touted play watching the first fifteen minutes of heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads is colossal torture like status elipticus it s suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen having hopes it might pick up that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums don t take my word for it watch it yourself and see 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
the last picture show meets von ryan s express unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone the attempt to make the protagonist milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often 
unfortunatlly i got a dvd that dosnt work he lagnguge is not english and when i tried changing and choosing english lang it dosnt repond so am stuck with i 
the worst friday ! but if you want the complete set i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan isn t much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie 
contrived implausible crime drama four brothers is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton s increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story reeking of artificiality features mark wahlberg tyrese gibson andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery the quartet launches into action seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced through their investigation in the neighborhood that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first year film student we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith rendering the boys thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best the acting is uniformly flat with the characters little more than wafer thin stereotypes and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second rate given the singleton pedigree in this area the boys running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother s killer is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque with nary a single moment that rings believable or true four brothers is by thebook filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more 
it was great and awful at the same time blue lagoon was a commercial success but due to the terrible acting and the cheesy storyline the movie did very bad with the critics i personally loved the beautiful scenery the ocean and the islands it really does make the movie worth seeing and brooke shields was just about the most gorgeous girl to look at when she made this movie this is why the movie was a commercial success though brooke s acting was just terrible she was so beautiful to look at that no one cared now brooke is trying so hard to become a serious actress she tries and tries and tries however though she has improved somewhat she just is not a good actress i just watched bob the butler and throughout the movie her efforts to try so hard to act well made it that i just couldn t see her character brooke shields trying so hard to act was all that anyone could see however this doesn t for a second take away from her great beauty and sweet nature she is a very nice person and a very lovely woman so if you haven t seen blue lagoon see it if you just want to get lost in the beauty of nature and brooke shields otherwise you ll just laugh at this movie 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
very boring with walk ons by fmaous people this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it s really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you ll miss him 
quotis theah a convick in that theah closet quot strange stuff duvall rants gibbers and fires a shotgun into an empty closet haas watches listens and smiles a lot the great james earl jones wanders in scratches his beard and mutters to himself and walks out again if this sounds like your kind of thing jump right in but nobody s ever going to claim this is horton foote s finest hour 
not good just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i m a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging

attack of the mutant flies the script outrageously lifts the opening set up from quot the big chill quot until the swarm of mutant flies shows up and attacks the cast thats right mutant flies ! the problem is that flies are not scary at all they do not have the shriek factor of spiders scorpions or roaches the terrible cgi effects do not help there are a couple of effective suspense moments but most of the action takes place in daylight which deminishes the scare factor

thoroughly predictable thriller the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another previous reviewers have covered these absurdities the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving previous reviews in this thread provide details 
the return of halloween sorry look elsewhere i remember when i was in fifth grade i snuck downstairs late at night to sneak a peek at the original halloween when it was on hbo i was mesmerized and scared to death at the same time the shape aka michael myers was a chilling and oddly fascinating character the sight of his shadow on the side of a building sent shivers up my spine i remember a scene that showed his silhouette against a house for a few seconds and the camera cut away as someone caught a glimpse of him when the camera returned he was gone little things like that scared me more than what little blood there was halloween sparked a number of imitators that added buckets of blood but none of them had those little scary touches like the scene of the shape against the wall so when halloween h was announced i was at once a little skeptical but excited jamie lee curtis would reprise her role as laurie strode the survivor of the first and second halloween movies h would be ignoring those sequels from to that had basically turned the storyline into another slasher epic with the addition of psychic powers strange secondary characters and a complete loss of focus on the true nature of what had made the original so powerful with a lot to live up to halloween h had the potential to disappoint as easily as it could return the series to greatness unfortunately the movie does not live up to the original it barely matches up to s unnecessary halloween ii it tries very hard to be better than those other now ignored sequels but it doesn t quite make it its now and laurie strode has moved to northern california to take a job as the head of a private school she has a year old son named john josh harnett who attends the school laurie and john have been battling the demons inside laurie s head in different ways laurie copes through alcohol and john tries to keep her straight it s beginning to take a huge toll on both of them and something s got to give a visit from michael myers however is not quite what they need but it s what they get ill leave what little plot is left to the movie if you decide to see it you won t need to take notes to keep anything straight it s as simple as slasher movie plots get with plenty of false scares and predictable dialogue the movie tries hard to be unique even including appearances from l l cool j adam arkin and janet leigh jamie lee curtis real life mom and psycho star however director steve miner who directed friday the th part ii and friday the th part iii attempts to pay homage to the original by aping some of its best scenes only one involving a closet pays off the rest are so blatantly lifted from the original it gives the movie a by thenumbers appearance as if miner expected to regain the greatest of the original by taking the best scenes from it that s like attempting to retain a painting s originality by simply taking a picture of it it may look good from far away but up close it s going to be missing more than a few key elements if nothing else halloween h serves as an adequate final chapter in the splintered timeline of the halloween series that s about it 
you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer

only rent if you really must see it the plot had some potential but unfortunately we ended up with this instead it s not cheesy it s lame this is one of those films where characters make really dumb decisions that make no sense or do really stupid things in the name of trying to create some tension so much so that the movie is more tedious and boring then anything however because the plot wasn t bad and the effects were pretty decent i gave it stars that said i would have to say your not missing anything by passing this one over 
unforgettable unfortunately this movie survives in my memory for over years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one rare or better than this one as an example buffalo is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
a star is born fails to capture audience s sympathy a star is born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons by failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star s tragic downfall the film displays a schizophrenic quality there is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen this is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors it s the nature of the material itself perhaps if we were to see the james mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living the audience would understand what the garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters instead we see garland s character despairing over a not very likeable washed up drunk and we re left feeling as empty as the film itself 
hu i m confused this movie made no sense to me whatsoever it wasn t really funny and it wasn t scary the only thing that i got was that he killed zombies or returners as he called theme and was upssed with one i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot but that was the only good thing in the film it was also boring but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you 
one of my least favorite episodes look to be fair one man s bote is another man s quotmanosquot what i mean by that is some people may love this ep but i personally didn t find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub average riffing doesn t save it the best lines that mike amp the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says unfortunately the feature s horrible pacing slow dialogue scenes and atrocious acting are not enough and it seems like the writers took a break on this one of course even weak mstk is better than pretty much any other show but i must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season and at times feels like a season episode the riffing is sparse and not really funny if you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it s best get either quotmanos hands of fate quot or quotred zone cuba quot 
the worst movie ever made bar none this is without question the worst movie ever made it makes plan from outer space look like roger ebert must be a genius no one could accidentally make a movie this bad i guess it s a comedy that is if you find the contents of a toilet funny

great movie lousy dvd while this is a great movie this dvd reproduction does it severe injustice the sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the dvd is marginal 
dissapointed ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander got my tickets in advance and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater the movie was a huge dissapointment while i wasn t expecting the movie to be just like the book i certainly wasn t expecting that while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears despite the fact that i ve read it over times 
uncle buck with john candy this movie was not entertaining at all bad script etc 
strictly based on a foreigner s point of view being a salvadorean i must say that this movie is based on an outsider s viewpoint first of all there was no dictaroship the death squads were splinter squads operating apart from the government and the military second human rights only came to stir up more trouble as our police military and other sectors have been downgraded in favor of system which is comfortable for the fmln the former guerrillas now a government party the movie portrays them as some kind of heroes and critisices the usa for helping our military which was getting murdered mutilated and tortured by the opressive guerrillas i seriously doubt any salvadorean finds this movie historically accurate i myself do not remember anything portrayed in the film happening in reality and contrary to foreing belief our country is not in same stage as when the guerrillas were terrorising ours and blaming the government for it this is classic propaganda done through a film misinformation to the foreign public in hopes of critsicing our democratic government and liberty loving way of life in the end this movie is nothing more than a confused foreign opinion on something that only us salvadoreans truly understand 
what a bunch of village idiots at first i was really hyped to see this movie with the big named stars especially ms weaver but when it was over i shouted i knew it for a hard core horror movie fan like myself that s definitely a sign of a bad movie review to come this movie broke my record of figuring out the plot even before the first minute was through and the only reason why i sat through the entire movie was because i had my check book to balance and a few crypto puzzles to complete the village reminded me of nothing more than a slap shod script tossed around for a few days among amature script editors then rushed into the credulous hands of famous stars not only did this movie ruin a few good careers it also ruined my respect for those who stared in it tip for the day if someone gives you a free copy of the village sell it on an auction site immediately trust me you won t feel guilty getting rid of it as fast as you can you ll experience more suspense selling it to the highest bidder than having to sit through the entire movie 
not big on mixing musical with fantasy i never saw this movie until i was the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments well so did fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason ! everyone burn your copies now 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
watch the original an exact copy of ang lee s wonderful quoteat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i d already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i d seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you haven t seen either see the better of the two exact same stories eat drink man woman 
utterly forgettable thriller drama very dull indeed melanie griffith rachel leigh cook and hugh dancy star in this straight tovideo film about one female transporter who gets into trouble because of someone plotting against her well that s all about it apparently but the film tries to give something unique to the otherwise unoriginal plot i mean the slightly original character of sarah by melanie griffth who plays that smuggler in trouble given a special job by malcom mcdowell with his customary icouldbeverybaaaad smile sarah agrees to carry a pack hidden in her bag but as you know someone also wants that package and well that s nothing new but she is attacked on the way dont expect any thriller however the film s focus is not about that it is the relations about sarah and jack dancy who live together in a fancy paris apartment but while sarah is away from paris on business jack is attracted to a younger lady jenny cook who also falls for him thus the film makes an effort to include both love and crime nice try considering this interesting point about the character of elder lady sarah but if the factor is taken away from the film the end result is nothing but a flat tired suspence suspence as to its relations and its crimes alike either way the film is emotilnally very void ok two fatally bad things one too incredible characters see sarah is a professional courier who must know the rules of the job which could be dangerous but instead of renting a car and it s europe where that could be pretty easy she takes a train and a night train in which she becomes an easy target in this way the film misses every chance to make it more suspenceful when some character s must die they die like characters in old video games they fall that s all the other one acting let me be honest it was painful to watch the one dimentional performance of melanie griffith who was very good in another day in paradise maybe she is not the greatest actor but certainly she can act but as far as tempo is concerned no i don t think so only the location of paris saves this film from utter forgettableness forget about this one 
stars i m sure it was more exciting in the early s i guess i missed the point i can see how this film could be considered a horror classic i m sure the violence was ground breaking in in fact one of the comments in the making of on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres i don t think it s a well done film overall it s lacking in story music direction and suspense the acting is not too bad but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes if i was craving some good s horror i d rather watch i spit on your grave or the texas chainsaw massacre 
new york stock trader to messenger i don t think so contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script think about it take a dump on a stock and get wiped out now you are a messenger i do not think so i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades but this is crazy thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum yes he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote 
typical van damme is that the rock who is in this movie looking malnourished with the rotted teeth and sinister contact lenses make up this movie is horrible but it is typical for a van damme flick horrible acting over produced with that cheesy waxy feel to it non existent storyline and the usual idiotic ending i have to admit though that i have most of van damme s movies he is a decent martial artist in my opinion his best movies are kickboxer and bloodsport these are his only movies that are actually enjoyable to watch and somewhat inspiring i have a few observations comments questions to make that should be humorous for the seasoned van damme fan isn t it funny that with all his millions of dollars that van damme can t find a plastic surgeon who can hide that silly bump on his forehead why must every character van damme plays speak with a french accent he tries to play a wide variety of different action hero roles but always the character must in some way originate from france isn t this preposterous you d think if van damme was serious about his acting career he would have attempted to remedy this flaw i mean it s not like his acting roles are all that challenging but it would be nice if he was even partially believable in his roles why does van damme always have to show his bare rear end so much does he think women are watching his silly movies you d think someone would realize that mostly men watch action films and the majority of men have no desire to see his naked backside so why show it is it me or does van damme need a good hair stylist his hair is especially stupid in cyborg he looks like he should be in the cast for revenge of the nerds speaking of style was it van damme himself who invented that stupid tucked in shirt with pleated dockers pulled up way too high over the waist with a snazzy belt s look if so for this deed alone he should be reprimanded why was van damme such a huge action hero he is so friggin short that if you saw him in line behind you at a convenience store i don t think he would look all that intimidating at least steven seagal is tall and tough looking although van damme is definitely in better shape you never see seagal showing his muscles lastly even though i can laugh about van damme i am definitely a fan that being said i wonder if any of his other fans share my sentiments about the producers directors and just about everyone else involved with most of his many films i think they should be ashamed of the way they have done their work van damme has alot of heart maybe not so much as stallone but more heart than most action heroes like shwarzenegger etc the people involved with most of van damme films have truly done a disservice to him and to action film fans everywhere they should have taken pride in their work it s not like they weren t paid handsomely for their services 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
a movie about nothing i purchased this dvd with my eyes wide open because i had been forwarned by reviewers i respect and i still place dylan s renaldo and clara near the top of my most pretentiuos doo doo list but wait that was almost years ago and this movie stars jeff bridges and john goodman the dude abides also jessica lange giovanni ribisi val kilmer bruce dern mickey rourke and was co written and directed by larry charles of seinfeld and friends fame so how bad could it be well i planned on watching it one night but after about minutes became fatiqued and fell asleep this went on for about more nights until i finally finished the movie the week before i had watched the uncut heavens gate nearly hours a deliberate slowly paced film in one sitting and yet m and a seemed so much longer i also skipped watching the few deleted scenes something i can t remember ever doing and went straight for the making of and watched and listened to those involved talking about the great script and a movie i can t remember seeing i realize now that deleted scenes would be overkill since the entire movie seems like it s just a bunch of strung together deleted scenes this is not to say the movie is unwatchable i had kept coming back to it night after night in fact there are some very entertaining and surreal moments in the film i just wish there had been more of them for starters i would have liked to have seen more of ribisi for he was the most focused in his part though it also seemed like he was in another movie they could have beefed up the christian slater chris penn bits or even made them the main characters and created a sort of abbott and costello meet jack fate val kilmer was great but he disappeared too soon and some of the songs dylan did with his band were pretty good but they could have given the young girl tinashe kachingwe who stole the show singing the times they are a changin more of dylan s songs to sing the best part of the film for me was jeff bridges as a dudesque reporter asking dylan s jack fate lots of bizarre questions in fact a short that just edited together all these bits would be enjoyable i guess that s most of the good stuff but on the other hand i wish they had removed the entire subplot concerning his dying father richard sarafian angela bassett and mickey rourke and despite old man makeup his father still looks younger than bob things must have been pretty bad in prison less of lange and goodman would have made it less irratating and luke wilson and particularly penelope cruz should have ended up on the cuttingroom floor i m not sure what to make of ed harris in black face except that i felt like he was a refugee from some old fellini film bob dylan acts like he sings which isn t so bad in a film where many of the other actors are so over thetop and watching him is like looking at an abstract painting it doesn t ever change but you keep looking at it to try and find some inner meaning this is larry charles first film and judging by his tv work you would have expected it to be at least funny but where seinfeld was supposed to be a tv show about nothing but was actually about alot this movie really is about nothing 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show

awful film barely saved by a couple of decent acting performances the next generation is basically a remake of the original texas chainsaw massacre in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical though different characters and locations are used the original was a little overrated in my opinion and this remake is quite frankly terrible bad acting with the exception of renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several b movie actors the only major differences from the original are that leatherface now dresses as a woman which was fairly amusing but hardly essential and a tacked on conspiracy theory the conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous i won t explain it theres no point watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though even die hards admit its awful i only gave it stars because i reserve star for the very worst of the worst yes even worse than this

nose candy want some for the first time in reviewing films i found myself immediately uninterested in this story i don t know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters but it felt bland overused and completely unoriginal within the first thirty minutes i found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story i felt as if i had seen this structure before and tart was providing nothing new to surprise me after thinking that it may just be my mood i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning but the same feeling persisted i just didn t care that is not a good sign the characters were bland when i say bland i literally mean that by watching them develop you will never have any flavor hit your palate the story seemed recycled nearly to the point of plagiarism now i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story but she added nothing fresh to the perspective the casting was horrid the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them nor the characters and the stories were vague and sloppy you knew nothing about anyone or anything and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters we instead found ourselves with drugs minor sex and money pushed into our faces these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time yet somehow could not be creatively captured by wayne what immediately pulled me away from this story it was mainly the characters i have seen most of brad renfro s work and honestly he needs to redefine himself director larry clark has defined him and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character within the first twenty minutes of renfro s screen time i was bored i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why it was spectacular nor impressive just repetitive he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role instead of just blandly playing this random socialite without a strong character the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film while i am on the subject nobody showcased the best of their abilities what is going on with dominique swain outside of lolita i don t believe she has really emerged as an actress and following up with roles such as cat storm doesn t help bijou phillips was the only actress that i witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen sadly due to everyone else s horrid acting she was lost rambling here and there and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act melanie griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film s budget probably went to her two scenes that she was in maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from the kids in the hall who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project my biggest problem outside of the acting was the pacing of this film nothing and this is hard for me to say but nothing gelled together there were so many sub stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed the robberies the teenage angst and woe the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is the random kids in the hall guy and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together with this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape family structures were never defined characters were never given any emotion and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers wayne did not complete the task at hand while i hate to put the entire burden on the director with this film i am left with little choice with a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any good behind tart this was a film i had heard nothing about and after viewing it i can see why all wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film tart it is hard for me to say this but wayne ruined this film while i don t believe there was much to fully take from the story any remaining elements of excitement were drained as wayne took the helm while most of the time you can credit some of the story perhaps strong acting or even the music in tart you can credit nothing from the opening sequence until the end i felt like i was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal no consistency no strength overall this film is a waste of your time if you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society you will not find it in this film while i know that was what wayne was attempting to show the final product seems like it was edited on an etch asketch it was an embarrassing film to sit through and encourage nobody to pick it up wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her columbia university education and destroyed two hours of my life avoid at all costs grade out of

stars i m sure it was more exciting in the early s i guess i missed the point i can see how this film could be considered a horror classic i m sure the violence was ground breaking in in fact one of the comments in the making of on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres i don t think it s a well done film overall it s lacking in story music direction and suspense the acting is not too bad but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes if i was craving some good s horror i d rather watch i spit on your grave or the texas chainsaw massacre 
horrible hard as it is to do this film manages to make jet li look very very bad i kept having karate kid flashbacks ! the story is the same old same old american martial arts move cliches fighting for honor and all in a place that is obviously not los angeles the real disappointment is that the martial artists in come cases obviously just local students for god sake are sub par and the choreography suffers for it the action sequences are slow and awkward pass on this one guys 
not even good when i purchased devils rejects this movie came free i watched it and hated it its about a sick individual who is on the internet trying to get women to come over for a party when they do he torchers them with hooks piercings the whole nine yards after he is cought he is put into a mental institution when he comes back as a nice guy the town people still want him dead he gets beat up so slowly he tries to take on some of the town people by now he then goes back for the girl that escaped and well doesnt live because her father kills him its not a good movie at all 
horribly crude stuff the chaplin cult continues to amaze me as it is inexplicable to me that anyone could find anything hinting of greatness in any of these very crude comedy shorts i agree that chaplin s feature films were generally very goodbut this stuff is unfunny and uninspired if i see chaplin zip around that revolving door one more time i will go mad ! in another short chaplin gets everyone at an alcohol rehab center drunk isn t that hilarious he plays a cop in another and hits everyone in his path talk about crude slapstick i saw some of these played to a contemporary audience in a theatre recently and there wasn t a single laugh the audience grew impatient and when the film finally ended people said quotwas that it quot until the late s any keaton lloyd or langdon film was infinitely better than the stuff that chaplin turned out at the time keaton hasn t aged chaplin has 
complete fiction while there has never been a completely factual account of the life of wyatt earp tombstone comes the closest this film is completely fictional first wyatt isn t even married in this version and he becomes enamored with a woman named clementine thus the title doc holliday was a dentist but in this film he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves as a piece of western fiction this film would be alright but since it was decided to use the names wyatt earp doc holliday and the ok corral the entire project is distracting the only accurate facts in this film are that there was a wyatt earp a doc holliday and an ok corral if it wasn t for the excellent performances of henry fonda and especially walter brennen i would have given this film one star 
i hated this film this film after reading all of the reviews i was so excited to view a great film however after about an hour of waiting for something plausible to happen it just drifted and drifted and meandered and oh here s a scene she says no to the main character advances and he ignores her initial rejection and then it meanders more into something so absurd that i started to laugh cmon people ! to all of you and star people just because a film involves beautiful settings and artsy characters that does not constitute a story ! im sorry maybe it s me but message to the character claudia in the movie if some cad starts coming onto you while he s simultaneously searching for his fiancee and your friend who may very well have drowned then get a miles away from this scum and to all viewers watching this exercise in self indulgence and boredom get a miles away from this farce of a film i am an enormous fan of stylish artistic films but just like those paintings at fancy museums that are being portrayed as elite art but instead are just simple circles and triangles on a blank canvas this film is not art it s just boring boring boring uninteresting i could not care about these characters any less other than poor anna who disappeared from that island actually now that i think about it anna was the only smart one there ! she jumped off that island as quickly as she could so as get out of this ostentatious boring pompous self indulgent uneventful dreadful meandering dumb film way to go anna ! you re the only one with any sense even if you did drown trust me that is a better fate than having to survive this dull film so in case you didn t get my point let me spell it out once again i hated this film so completely ! i would rather watch water trickling from my sink at least that has a story ! aaaargh i want my hours back ! i gave up precious hours of my life to watch this pathetic film 
not really an apt title i remember managing to find a drive in that was showing the first run eceg and i remember my girlfriend not saying a word while we watched she was too kind in retrospect it was so totally wrong for the time that one almost has to respect it i say almost it was a numbing experience then and the most one can say for it now is at least the elvis impersonators will leave it alone the story is weak the co stars are painful and the soundtrack so bad the weakest selling record of elvis career managed to kill of the extended playing record but for all that it is elvis and the true beliver will find something in it worth carrying away its just best watched alone 
dismayingly bad it s not just that if lucy fell is a bad film of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer directorstar eric schaeffer s nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday s roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he s cute speaks volumes 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
a b movie with a little more substance michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion he has done such great b movies as this q and it s alive island of the alive how awesome is he anyways i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously thinking that it is going to be your typical movie but you shouldn t because not only is this a b movie but it is supposed to be funny my favorite part is when the stuff started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it who would do that i just started laughing by butt off when that happened so if you watch this movie just sit back and enjoy it for what it s worth don t be too critical on it what i learned from the stuff dairy products are evil ! especially if they come from with in the earth if you like the stuff i recommend watching other b movies such as island of the alive zombi and etc 
kids found it boring if you re trying to instill an appreciation for classical music and i can t imagine any other reason to show peter and the wolf to kids don t buy this version the dvd does have background music from the symphony but the musical aspect is not even mentioned the true test is in its appeal yearold boy yearold boy yearold girl all found it boring 
really really really bad off hand i can t think of a worse movie and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey he s making a buck here that s all star if possible 
a waste of time and money i purchased this dvd hoping it would relay information on coral reefs and the myriad of life living in them while the focus of the movie was on the endangerment of the reefs due to global warming overfishing etc most of the movie was spent above the water focusing on the the filmmaker and his wife and their trivial lives the imagery was beautiful when they were under the water but it s only a small percentage of film very disappointing 
where is the disco song i love the nightlife not the original film doesn t have the original disco scene with i like the night life song they completely ruined the movie 
historically inaccurate but served its purpose at that time good special effects for that time period served its purpose to boost the morale of the american public during the heroic acts by those in the u s military at that time should always be remembered outgunned and outmanned they held their own and then some on wake island and in the philippines however the writers and producer play it pretty loose as far as historical accuracy was concerned no b s ever flew from hawaii to wake island and on to clark field in the philippines after the attack on pearl i believe it is common knowledge that no b s ever sank the japanese fleet advancing on the philippines remember colin kelly what was laughable was the scene where the mary ann makes an emergency landing on maui instead of hickam field on dec th upon landing they re fired upon by local island japanese throughout the movie there are references to sabatoge committed by japanese americans in hawaii on dec th upon landing at hickam field because the japs on maui were shooting at us a colonel goes on about japanese vegetable trucks driving onto the runway at hickam and crashing the tails of rows of p s before the attack never happened in truth there were no acts of sabatoge committed by the japanese population in hawaii this movie only serves to perpetuate the common belief that japanese americans were disloyal and unpatriotic citizens during wwii when in fact this was not the case it should be noted that a good number of japanese americans many of whom were thrown into prison camps after dec th died fighting for the united states during wwii in order to prove their loyalty to this country may i suggest people watch the movie go for broke after watching air force to educate themselves on what really happened in wwii 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
overrated transit station letter writerforhire dora although she writes letters she never sends is relatively closed off from the world around her but is forced to open up when she is begged to write a letter for a woman to her young son s long lost father as dora witnesses this mother get hit by a bus in the next moment she realizes the young son is basically orphaned for the moment so she opens up but not in the feel good maternal instinctto spare way american viewers might expect no dora is keen to exploit this find and tries to sell josue the little boy for a television eventually though dora forms a kind of bond with josue and goes out searching for the boy s father unfortunately it seems too easy for dora who is obviously hardened to life and all its sensitivities to break down all these carefully formed barriers her emotion somehow does not seem authentic toward the boy as a result the performance is nowhere near the triumph most reviewers have claimed and the film lacks a certain credibility sure the film is watchable and somewhat interesting but it was overrated 
disgusting and pointless listen bunuel what are we going to do the witch has quit says too much nudity who does she think she is mother theresa i am a little busy jp quiet babe ! can t you see i am talking to my producer here just get another broad for the role anybody only with a good front but maestro ! we d have to re shoot half of the movie fernando is already talking of another engagement in any event with his rate if we use him again it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick we might as well scrap the whole thing dont worry jp we ll keep shooting as if nothing happened that s what being great director all about they are morons or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage most won t even notice that the face is different and those who do will find a good explanation for it subliminal surreal existential women are alike all that nonsense you know relax and have a drink 
i know it is a very bad movie before clicking the link on this page for this film i knew that someone would say very bad movie or very bad film it is awful but me and my friend use to laugh when we d mention the title of this film and at the end when he s spinning around in a wheelchair how can some of the best actors be in such a film great cast bad script bad movie it s stupid and very violent there are parts that are funny though like when daniel stern says have you done this before when he knew what to do with the body yes it is awful it really is the darkest comedy ever they went way too far it s almost as sick as the movie freeway another movie with great actors in such a terrible film atrocious films 
stick with the disney version when i watched the version with paul ruebens as the title character i liked it so i decided to watch this with my little brother i did not like this movie at all i feel bad for feeling that way cause jonathan taylor thomas was great in the lion king man of the house and home improvement but this movie is not enjoyable or watchable at all 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
dvd buyer beware viewers hoping to see the controversial quotpistolquot scene in which mcgillis s character is forced by her jealous husband to open her legs for his gun will be disappointed to find that it has been cut from the r rated dvd version for that you ll apparently have to stick with the unrated vhs tape other than that the movie is a decent if unspectacular b thriller and the digital transfer is pretty good 
watch kentucky fried movie instead i love these whacky kind of comedys and when i heard about this one i tried to track it down for about years finally after it s release here for under aus i was highly disapointed by waiting in anticipation for what i was sure was going to be histerical cause of what other reviewers wrote about it it was a complete bore for about minutes i didnt think what they where doing was funny at all the only funny bits where a couple of the sketches chevy chase was in and an amusing puppet but the or laughs i had during this movie didnt save it id recomend you watch kentucky fried movie instead of this snore fest even it s attempt a stoner humour failed beleive me i love these kind of movies but this is by far one of the biggest piles of i have ever seen that so many have said is a classic it doesnt compete with goof satire movies like kentucky fried movie airplane flying high naked gun repossessed silence of the hams spaceballs hotshots loaded weopen scary movie history of the world young frankinstein anything by monty pythoncheck out one of those instead 
hmmm fun but don t take it as history this movie is a bit new fantasy they go waaayy beyond reinventing a story still garbo does a nice acting job too bad they didn t thought it would be neccisary to dy her hair black like mata hari was in real life the movie is still a good classic but don t take it as history mata hari the legend 
just ok i v seen a multitude of documentaries both low and high budget and although i found the story interesting i felt this film was not up the hype it was given worth seeing but not worth owning 
not a definite favorite i don t like the fact that somebody can take a horror movie and turn it into a joke i couldn t even get through this movie once i just don t like films that express monsters as four legged dog creatures the relic is a story about a ritual gone wrong when some foolish explorer actually drinks this weird concoction from a tribe of indians mysteriously enough the liquid turns him into a beastly creature that lives in the sewers under a mansion dont get this movie 
duped duped duped duped ! i kept readin stuff about youll like this if you re into doc savage well i like doc savage and was not into this it was excruciatingly dull and probably the hardest film i ve ever made myself sit through to get my moneys worth and personally if it had just come on tv and i d never even heard of it i truly doubt i would have made a single doc savage connection duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuped 
nothing wrong with movie but dvd fails this has always been a favorite film of mine the story is old fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine despite having the vhs i wanted more and ordered the dvd beware this dvd claims on its packaging to have closed captioning but it does not no subtitles in any language no line captioning nor does it have anything else interactive menus means scene selections this plain vanilla release doesn t even have a trailer this film and cast deserves better and i see no reason lion s gate reissued this dvd with nothing added since i bought it online i can t return it and neither lion s gate nor artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people i bought it from 
unbox video not yet working will not play once video was downloaded i get the error message can not play file please try again later error x i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed i was told the unbox saturday and sunday hours i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again feb 
boring i only liked it when pinnochio talked that was funny but the rest of the movie was discusting some of the scens were very sick not the blood but other things there was no blood hardly and i could have made it alot better i espected a good film but it was and i would never see it again 
very disappointing i didn t have high expectations for this movie yet it still managed to completely disappoint me i adore robin williams and his performance was the best part of the movie but the script was abysmal and sara played by marcia gay harden was a completely one dimensional character the antics of the sidekick robot and the flubber itself were just plain embarrasing to watch too bad because the idea is great but frankly the original was pretty bad too they really could have done so much with this story either the first or the second time around 
see this movie at lest once to see just how bad it is unlike it s predecessor heavy metal k has one single minute story arch talking place in the far future using both hand drawn animation and very bad cgi bad even for the basic plot is that a miner named tyler michael ironsides stumbles across a green glowing crystal that is a literal key to the fountain of youth the only draw back is that the moment he touches it tyler goes completely bonkers and starts killing a lot of people the key draws tyler to a settlement called eden full of people who haves traces of the life giving compound in them giving them a healthy good looking looks tyler probtly kills half of the population and kidnaps the rest a lone survivor of the raid julie julie strian begins a blind quest of revenge everything that could be bad in any given movie is bad in hmk the dialog is terrible both written and performed the camera work is terrible there s no back story to speak of tere are loop holes that even a baby can see not even a connection to the first firm with the loc nar which the key is suppose to be a shard from except that it s green also there are not special features on this dvd i don t mind the violence or the nudity in fact i want to see more of that in western animation but this movie is just as forgettable as any other movie that julie strian stars in 
man oh man you talk about disappointed this is the icing on the cake all i hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was not even close whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong i love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such there are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the s but this is not one of them seriously don t buy this i don t know why it is so highly regarded the acting story and especially the music is el terrible it s like porn quality acting a story written in about minutes and music from a disney movie it could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy through in some disturbing music and made the bad guys well more bad it could be remade which i m usually against 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
ugh this is an extremely dry anime the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor not so for the anime the character batou was especially funny in the manga but for reasons unknown he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking these really make the movie crawl one minute there s action next you re listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism seriously these little talks take up of the movie the visuals are awesome no question about that even so they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story altogether not much actually happens during the movie if you must see it rent it first to be sure you want it 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
bad from beginning to end not sure what is worse the horrible script or the horrible acting typical mean girl makes epiphany and changes to good person script watching schneider dress in women s clothes for an entire movie is just creepy using lemon juice for eye drops would be more enjoyable than watching this movie 
bad misfire i ve never read the balzac novel this movie is based upon but if balzac wrote a coherent story it didn t make it to the screen this time around the settings and costumes are glorious leading one to expect somewhat high brow entertainment perhaps on the order of merchant ivory not to be a sophomoric joke repeatedly cropping up in the film is elizabeth shue s naked backside huh wouldn t the gendarmes come running in paris sacre bleu none of these people are very nice but they don t deserve the mischief cousin bette inflicts upon them and what is jenny cadine s motivation for letting herself be used in bette s schemes nothing makes sense and the whole movie was just bad misfire avoid if possible 
quite boring the young actor is great in this movie but the film itself is non exciting and a bit boring 
irritating and unorigional i don t remember seeing isild le besco in any other films but she does look a bit familiar if i have seen her elsewhere it must have been in a role that she performed with much greater insight and finesse than gwen from girls can t swim or i definitely would remember i m still not sure what the title actually means something about young women struggling to find their way blah blah blah but it actually wasn t a terrible film nevertheless le besco s performance is one of the most irritating i ve seen in years i was reminded of dorothy parker s cutting remark when critiquing a katherine hepburn film she runs the gamut of emotions from a to b le besco was either shown with an extremely obnoxous smile plastered on her face or she was smacking her friends or family in a hissy fit of rage these tantrums always ended with gwen running off to the sea with all the grace of a three legged moose what made lebesco s performance stand out even more was the fact that everyone else s performances were nearly flawless this film was recommended to me after purchasing leffrontee a truly marvelous picture while watching the first minutes of girls can t swim i could see that i was not the only person who admired leffontees subtle brilliance obviously the director and or screenwriter of girls cant swim intended on building upon the other film s message but as a lark they subtracted all of its poignance and sensitivity i give the film out of because despite its flaws it is still superior to the vast majority of toejam that hollywood produces each year 
be leary of all these excellent reviews this movie is a shakespeare play the dialog is impossible to understand for much of this movie anyone who says that they understand everything these actors are saying must be lying no one speaks this way now and it is very hard to follow i wish i had known that it was shakespeare before i bought it but for some reason i didn t the movie is also like a play but in a movie format this might not be to everyone s liking just be cautious of all these rave reviews people here claiming this review as not helpful are the ones pretending like they understand every word of a shakespeare play i would just like to continuously pause the dvd and ask them what the actors just said and let them fumble over themselves trying to explain 
fine historic rendition filmed in this movie is in black and white and might be considered dull and slow moving by today s standards an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research 
anti southern propaganda this movies rates right up there with schindlers list in terms of unapologetic propaganda fortunately ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making gettysburg and the even better gods and generals if you want to see a real accurate depiction of the war for southern independence aka the civil war watch gods and generals or gone with the wind and stay away from movie garbage like andersonville also watch for the extended version dvd of gods and generals coming for the christmas season of 
hands down the worst of the series that has to do with michael yup definately the worst halloween movie come on michael on a reality show ha ! what the f k does that have to do with the series not only that but the plot is completely pointless the acting sucks and dr loomis and jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie ! not only that but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary and therefore comes off as pretentious don t get me wrong i love gore in movies horror or not but any knowledgable halloween fan knows that the halloween movies were always scary without the gore along with halloween which actually had nothing to do with michael halloween resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series there are a many more problems with the movie than the ones i listed but i m tired of typing so i ll let other reviewers explain why it s so bad bottom line watch any halloween movie other than this or halloween 
it certainly doesn t age well i have wanted to see this movie since it came out in when i was first becoming interested in s radicalism i was at the time and now i really wish that i had seen it then and got that particular mania out of my system despite great acting by actors that had yet to be established ironically kevin kline s future wife phoebe cates would be in fast times at ridgement high that other movie with a cast of well known actors that the casting director somehow managed to find before they were famous the overall script is just a tedious mess of characters acting badly they are either guilty about selling out or they are trying to live the pissed off radical stereotype one that wears very thin after your th birthday and meg tilly is just there to say some of the funniest strange lines its like she was auditioning for the part of river on firefly years too early i won t deny that it s cool seeing jeff goldblum playing creepy and kevin kline fighting it otu with jeff daniels but the storyline feels dated last the special features are pretty weak the trailer is badly done the making of featurette has lawrence kasdan saying the exact same things he says on the liner notes and the extra scenes don t even show the kevin costner scenes that they filmed and edited out which is a shame since everyone goes on about how his character was the bright spot and the center of the group but we never get the sense that he s anything but a corpse of course halfway through the movie i started to wish that kasdan would have just done a movie abotu the costner character with his friends as minor players but then again when kasdan and costner did team up they produced the painfully dull wyatt earp so this is an ok movie but it s not great it doesn t deserve the respect it gets i m sure there are better movies abotu college friends reuniting and or the s there have to be anyhow watch it if you have the burning desire but don t pay full price 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
captives i have seen julia ormond in some good movies and she is a great actress this is not one of them senseless subject the audio is bad or the language is not what i am used with so i understood only half of what they said in the movie stay away from this one 
how much did they spend on this garbage worst levinson film i ve seen since envy i actually wish they had given us director commentary on this disc because i would have listened to a little of it just to see what barry levinson was thimking and i would cross my fingers and hope he would blame the whole thing on a really bad drug trip take a look at the man s filmography and tell me if you think this absolute disgrace belongs there worse he wasn t alone someone else liked the idea enough to co write it everyone else can blame a large paycheck but levinson actually came up with the idea this is one of the most beautiful terrible films i ever seen if they took one tenth of the imagination they put into the set and toy designs and invested it into the screenplay they might have had a movie 
he knows you re adork this movie really showcases the extreme dorkiness of the early s but it s really no one s fault they didn t know they were dorks back then that s just the way everyone acted before michael jackson came along clarence beeks the breakfast club guy turns in his usual mcgruff the crime dog performance and nice appearance by tom hanks too his nd best performance very closely behind saving private ryan which i would recommend watching immediately after seeing this movie they go well together oh well at least this movie gave the police squad ! an idea on how to open up their show and it s still better than hercules in new york although by very much no 
good book bad movie i loved the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first this movie is boring and did no justice to the book 
poor history and a screenplay over dramatic i m glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor over zealous and fanatic as was a common religious stance in those times promoted by both sides of the protestant catholic conflict she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes and throughout the film there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth no objectivity whatsoever i was sorely disappointed if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived i would recommend the superb bbc series elizabeth r with glenda jackson and if you want even further background look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary queen of scots although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it for example mary stuart and elizabeth never met although it was mary s great desire and even another title anne of the thousand days those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times this film just doesn t cut it 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
unfortunate edition this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film s mood i m not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition s music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge oftheseat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition 
the can be written for a democrat or republican for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his her dirty secrets covered up i feel that it s the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens and our government don t really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i can t fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time and believe me i don t feel it s right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man and if he does have the values his her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing and own up to his her mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it s alright to cover things up and there are no absolutes or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who s rich do we wait until then to change the moral that s pathetic and so is this movie 
trite the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i don t know where to begin whatever you do don t buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users

that movie was bad i hoped i could leave the theatre but i was hoping it would get better here let me put it this way d suckedplot suckedactors suckedmovie suckedplease don t make a sequel 
great stars and a great story can t prod this sleepy production awake what ever happened to the tight and taut political thriller movies of the sixties remember seven days in may the parallax view even the original manchurian candidate well unfortunately they find no suitable heir to their tradition in this movie the manchurian candidate remake provides a great story line and the original provides a great precedent they even have a great cast of seasoned actors and stars but the final result is slow plodding and whatever tension or mystery is built and there is not much of that is plainly dissipated so early that i kept wanting the damn assassination to be over and the hero shot so i could go to bed i m not sure if it s bad writing or bad editing to blame but the movie is a real disappointment i don t think the big name stars will want to remember it either the only thing worse are the dvd extras there are a series of short interviews with a selection of pundits discussing contemporary political challenges with terrorism and civil liberties under threat this should be a lively discussion unfortunately the pundits are all wannabe no bodies with absolutlely nothing valuable to say to make things worse none of them seem capable of making a logical adult sentence all vibe and no verbs the pundits all seemed to reflect the same leftoid point of view too nothing wrong with that i use the term leftoid because i think they are hollow shells pod people not real leftists these pundits if anything dumb down the left or liberal position so much that it is must be embarassing for genuine liberals or radicals to watch i can t see these guys persuading anyone what a waste surely they could have got a few talking heads that could actually talk from across the political spectrum if not they shouldn t have bothered 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
pipi longstocking pipi longstockingpippi longstocking by astrid lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named pipi she has a horse and a monkey named mr nelson next door are two very polite children named tommy and annika and they become friends i like that i can relate to annika in that she is always hesitant but after she gets started she doesn t want to stop pipi s fother is a sea man and left her at the house with a suitcase full of gold pieces pipi likes to go on adventures one was when pipi tricked two thieves into leaving her house with nothing this is just one example of the many heroic adventures in this exciting book i like that it has a moral that is deep so you have fun reading it and you close the book with a smile 
did i ever tell you about the time i invented snowboarding out cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous raunch button to be successful it tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor sexual slap stick classic hollywood references and x treme sport clips but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement while i will not be generous to this film i will begin this review by mentioning how proud i am of out cold again this was nowhere near a good film but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis i saw out cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous original and creative but just failed miserably one must give credit to those films that fail while trying because so many films today just honestly fail to try unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films as big boobs beer drinking and clich characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture out cold aims towards a general audience that i despise that audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity why do we as audience members do that is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor while out cold did not begin the trend in hollywood it did contribute to it and thus continuing films like date movie american wedding and dude where s my car to plague our theaters i think i have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of hollywood so let s look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed i have to get this first one out in the open why painfully i ask this question did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor snowboarding and casablanca together in one film the first two matched but the last was just pure rubbish outside of an adult audience not many children or teens would catch the classic hollywood film reference thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre now when the audience of out cold actually connect casablanca to out cold they will say lines like this movie is just like out cold this makes me so angry if parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say out cold took quite a bit from casablanca instead of the other way around casablanca needs to come first with that said our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters were there any great question ! i didn t see any instead i saw actors reacting to certain situations there were no definitions to anyone sure one could argue that there were some characters with pig pen and inga but when i see these moments i see clichs not characters anyone can play a druggie stoner big breasted woman town idiot and so forth but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest nothing of the sort happened here jason london was horrid as the title character and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as illinois jason s friends were obnoxiously unexciting and lee majors walked on set said his lines and walked off again there was nothing of value nobody went beyond the lines on their script which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film if i were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of david koechner of whom i cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth he is the prime example of what i was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers he was a unique character for bull mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead yet i do not blame the cast for it all the filmmakers the malloy brothers had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience as you may or may not have noticed they went with the latter the entire king of the mountain bit was horrendous not because of the storyline element but the fact that everyone s beer was flying nobody recognized anyone and only the characters we were familiar with were winners just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits bull mountain the funniest bit that i think the malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk the first one with the polar bear was not funny rather juvenile but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face it was this type of humor that i was expecting the entire film but overall continued to keep falling short overall out cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom sure there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public i am tired of this tween genre of film and while i know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie i am still tired of it it is as if most directors are just using the cut paste feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success but over time they just become boring again i will say that of most of the films in this genre out cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold but in the end it was nothing spectacular i don t think i could muster the strength to watch it again grade out of 
out of horrible q the winged serpent was one of the worst movies i have even seen i went into the film knowing it was a b movie but still wanting to be entertained i was not entertained for a film the gore in q the winged serpent probably shocked quite a few people there is also a scene that is quite enticing but aside from these two points of note the film offered little else including entertainment the acting was passable but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out the ok acting goes to waste save your money this is one of the worst movies ever made there are far better b movies it is the type of movie i would have liked in college in if i had been drunk and looking for laughs but this is and there are better bad movies with better gore and nudity you won t like q the winged serpent at all even for the drunk college student there are far better ways to spend minutes stay away total score out of out of enjoyment a rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film out of acting how good was the acting out of immersion did the movie suck me into the story out of intangibles special effects movie pace is the movie forgettable or something you will talk about and remember for weeks years out of must see is this movie worth seeing renting out of must buy is this movie a must buy purchase 
where is the old hunter buldeo the best of rudyard kipling s jungle book stories took place in the man village because that s where mowgli meets a superstitious old hunter named buldeo buldeo claims that the tiger shere khan is supernatural the ghost of a wicked old money lender when mowgli says that shere khan is only a very disagreeable tiger buldeo threatens to spank our young hero when buldeo learns that mowgli has a vendetta with the tiger and a black panther as his personal body guard the old man tells the other villagers that mowgli is a demon child who is able to turn himself from a boy to a wolf and back to a boy at will this is great story telling but where is buldeo he isn t in the movie at all ! it s like leaving the wicked witch out of the movie version of the wizard of oz on a side note in the kipling stories the black panther bagheera has a secret so shameful he can tell no one but mowgli bagheera was born in a zoo chained and keep in a cage for the amusement of men but rather than blame mowgli for the cruelty he suffered in captivity bagheera sees the boy as a kindred spirit they were both separated from their own kind at an early age once we have that bit of information the relationship between the boy and the panther makes sense we are able to understand bagheera s total devotion to the mowgli but the movie never explains that i realize that the movie shouldn t follow the book completely but since the book was so much richer the movie seemed like a let down 
the snake man cometh okay the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful the only good thing going for this movie was the return of snake plissken this film s plot was essentially a rehash of the original escape from new york a bit more special effects which in fact did not make this a better movie when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character characters kurt russell s character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them obviously the movie doesn t really know where it s going as it takes two scenes minutes of the film st scene president commandant and lackey give snake the mission nd scene commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission to explan to the audience what s the basic conflict i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer carpenterrussell please don t tell me money caused you to revisit a cult figure some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson stacy keach steve buscemi and pam grier robertson keach and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters sorry snake i don t love l athebiggreenpointyearedone 
exploitation versus art ingmar bergman s oscar winner and wes craven s shocker tell the same tale there is an interesting comparison to be made between ingmar bergman s classic the virgin spring and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired last house on the left by wes craven they share identical plots feature graphic rape scenes and before it s all over turn average men into murderers and yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and s oscar winning best foreign film and the other appreciated only in underground circles but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation so just how different are they not as different as you might imagine but as different as art and exploitation the virgin spring is easily one of bergman s most accessible films telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren t accustomed to seeing a young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy though they initially seem helpful their actions quickly become violent after a graphic for the time rape the girl is murdered later the wrongdoers happen upon the girl s home and seek shelter from her family both groups unaware of who the other is suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought it is a powerful tale of love loss and the depths people can be driven into where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code where savagery and rage take over bergman s film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by max von sydow as the father real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it s a winning combination but what endures in the story of the virgin spring is how strong a component faith becomes when there is nothing left to believe in can you still believe a classic in every sense the virgin spring still has the power to shock but there s something very redemptive about the film last house on the left however is probably more notorious than acclaimed the plot as i ve said is identical coming years later in wes craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale it is a shocker and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the torture cinema of today it is brutal uncompromising and graphic and the film was championed in the underground horror market working with a small budget the film lacks the artistry of the virgin spring while it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock what it lacks is depth and subtlety the characters aren t particularly drawn out so their actions don t have the emotional resonance of the earlier film without contemplating faith and moral choices what we re left with is straightforward revenge and the film ultimately has no redemption no uplift it s violence for the sake of violence it remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it s own right and therein lies the difference between art and exploitation kgharris 
don t be quotconquot vinced into watching this to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky rodney eastman was in the movie for about mins but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting dollars 
it watched it on fast forward except for two cuties william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard on 
just not gripping admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it s moments of entertainment but overall it s long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this didn t do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman s silent scientific discoveries completely amusing couldn t wait for the movie to end honestly 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
wayne and hepburn take african queen route the unique screen chemistry between john wayne and katharine hepburn barely elevates a western rehash of the african queen without wayne and hepburn this belated sequel to true grit wouldn t pass muster as a made fortv movie it s too bad peter bogdanovich didn t take up the duke s offer to direct the project he might have improved upon martha hyer s routine script this was wayne s next tolast western but he would end his career in a blaze of glory with the shootist 
no need to suicide i get the story line but grown women need to suicide the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself it is not matching the character 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
awful i thought this movie was absolutely awful it is one of the worst movie s i have seen in quite a while you keep waiting for the movie to get interesting but it never does i don t recommend this movie especially not to a guy he would be bored out of his mind by this one 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
ewwww that smell this stinks buy flying daggers just plain hero or buy fong sai yuk at an online retailer 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs

the usual cardone fare the forsaken j s cardone i should probably know better by now and yet i still subject myself to j s cardone movies in this one sean a guy dawsons creek s kerr smith hired to drive a car from los angeles to miami picks up a hitchhiker nick final destination s brendan fehr in the middle of the desert the two of them encounter megan a sick girl coyote ugly s izabella miko when they stop for the night in town nick insists she come with them saying he knows what s wrong with her and eventually tells sean that the group have vampires on their tail well the word vampires doesn t exactly crop up seriously but come on you know what they are the rest of the movie can be summed up with things blow up cardone is one of the straight toscifichanel directors who fills his movies with young andbeautifuls who have limited if any acting ability but are relatively easy on the eyes in their defense this is not a new tactic witness the brilliant film career of say farrah fawcett smith is a bit above the average y nb in acting ability though the other two here are right on the mark the minor characters don t have much to go on either as the script came straight out of a write your first screenplay in twenty one days kind of book which could make a passable film if you had a really original or even a really good fast paced plot alas no such thing exists here this movie deserves a mercifully quick slide into obscurity about the only was i can imagine it having any longevity at all is if it s somehow turned into a drinking game 
sad to see laurel amp hardy in decline in this mgm comedy directed by sam taylor laurel amp hardy are the chef and butler who foil a plot by enemy agents to poison the young exiled king christopher david leland on the one hand quotnothing but trouble quot spends time developing the boy kings growing love for the joys of common democracy such as playing football then we have the comic sequences in which laurel amp hardy wreck a dinner party try to take a steak away from a hungry lion and end up on the ledge of a skyscraper clearly the boys are getting too old for this kind of stuff not as bad as quotthe big noise quot but too close for comfort watching this one will only make you feel sad and not in a good way

children lend me your ears children of the corn had some potential a corn cult for children with a charismatic adolescent as its leader takes over a rural town in nebraska based on a short story by stephen king this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept unfortunately some very weak execution is what mars the movie its director fritz kiersch sometimes works as alan smithee the pseudonym for directors who don t want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys this movie doesn t quite warrant that though it isn t very good either there is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening yet simply is not most egregious is the use of hokey faux sacred music aside from linda hamilton john franklin and robbie kiger the performances are pretty weak it doesn t help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful isaac chroner franklin instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town his advice nearly prevents vicky and burt stanton from seeking medical help there but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids if the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh the incredibly lame final scene certainly will that is not to say this movie is all bad however though never scary there are a few effective moments throughout i don t want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie die hard horror fans might want to check out this release though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear this anchor bay dvd is anamorphic widescreen with good picture and sound though this is not the director s cut 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
monotone mediocre instruction the level of detail in the instuction varies widely some asanas are almost painfully dissected others seemingly glossed over also instruction is delivered in a very serious sounding monotone i would recommend the yoga zone tapes over these 
watch das boot instead i just finished watching das boot to even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous where das boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war u is just more hollywood tripe if you just want splosions and escapism i guess u does the trick if you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come go with das boot 
this gets stars i read all the reviews where everyone said this movie was so hilarious so i gambled and bought it man this movie really stunk i mean it s like it could have been funny but none of the re dubbing was very funny at all i watched this movie with some good expectations but as it droned on and on it slowly became apparent to me that no laughs were coming in fact as i kept watching it i kept thinking to myself geez even i could dub funnier dialogue into the movie than this ! dont get me wrong dubbing over a corny japanese spy movie definitely sounds like it would be very funny it s an idea that has the potential to be very funny it just wasn t done very well here don t expect many laughs from this movie for most of the movie no one is even talking at all ! you re just watching a bad not funny movie but if that s what you like then by all means buy it ps by the way this movie has it s occasional sexually interesting scenes but you don t ever get to see anything they ve edited out anything that might have been worth seeing so not only is it not funny but where the original movie would have turned you on you are denied that as well a nitpick to be sure but it didn t make me like this movie any better ps if you want to go watch something funny watch this is spinal tap that movie is truly hilarious it does not disappoint it doesn t have anything to do with woody allen but it will wash the bad taste out of your mouth that whats up tiger lily is guaranteed to leave you with 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
super awful it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it s one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her 
columbia wimps out too bad republic didn t make this serial because over there they at least had commando cody and captain marvel up in the skies instead we get some fake animation everytime our boy in blue jumps i m sure that some think it s cute but i felt cheated i give them stars for trying though 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
embarrasing to watch i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i couldn t find anything about this film i remember enjoying it s a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty s character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an s kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you ll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more 
brit pomposity at its erworst lots of dramatic images just watch it muted the narrative is merely one long whine and more often than not misstates details shows numerous clips with no explanation or description given very short on details long on opinion 
bad jet bad i know this was one of jet li s earlier films based on the clothing music and hairstyles of the characters in the movie and jet li looked much younger anyway i was quite disappointed i am glad jet s movies have gotten better because this one was my mouth hung open through most of it asians complain about being stereotyped in other people s movies but there were stereotypes about everyone in this movie and i know i am just rambling on but my goodnes it was pretty bad i gave it just one extra start just because it was jet ! 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
don t waste your precious lifetime on this one of the worst sci fi movies ever pitiful scenario a shoot em with no joy stick 
pretty forgotten by now the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that s a bad sign that the movie isn t going to be great ill try and remember that next time the only reason i am giving the fogotten stars is the scene with alfe woodward you ll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that s it happy viewing 
watch out for this title for those of you looking for more eva action after seeing the original series take heed don t buy this dvd ! the death part of the dvd part is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season and the second half rebirth part is new stuff very good but ! if you buy the end of evangelion you get rebirth and a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material so don t buy deathrebirth buy the end of evangelion instead 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
the most stupidest horror movie of all this movie is god awful i mean poor rene zellwegger being cast in this movie what did she turn down if this is what she picked don t get this movie see it on tv don t even rent it don t get it please i m saving you bucks 
too many unanswered questions i don t have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression this movie was not what i expected and the storyline had too many holes in it 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
belongs in a litter box when i watched this stinker i felt like sniffing it and covering it up this is just another attempt to cash in on nostalgia obviously the producers of the film were aiming at parents fond memories of the dr seuss classic childrens book and tried to exploit it into an updated version it fails miserably it is another example of hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script dont get me wrong this movie looks great it has awesome costumes and set design but the problem is it seems like they whipped the screenplay out in minutes even the kids think this movie stinks do your child a favor avoid this film and instead sit down and read your child the original book they will appreciate it way more 
pretty stupid and obnoxious almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of shaft which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you d be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree 
the devil made this movie i made my girlfriend a deal i ll watch the devil wears prada with you if you watch kung fu hustle with me we watched kung fu hustle first and she enjoyed it although she fell asleep near the end the next day we watched this i found it unbearable to even sit through the first half hour wow what a horrible movie in every way the over thetop cuteness the dumbed down script and generic characters all awful despite their supposed intentions it seems to me that movies like this are actually really demeaning to women i know it s supposed to be a chick flick but how i don t see how most women don t find this movie completely insulting and condescending aside from all that this film uses the same old trick of finding a hot chick and dressing her up in a sweater to make her ugly and fat oh and i m sure everyone who works at a fashion magazine making k a year is a ridiculously hot model i know i didn t finish the movie but i find it hard to believe anything that happens in the second half could possibly forgive the first half although my girlfriend did say that even though she agreed with me on almost everything i said about the movie part of her didn t really mind watching it must be something a man will never understand ps at least meryl streep was goo 
too true to life i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch that is how good it is 
not too bad but not too good i actually had this on my shelf for or years i tried to watch it a time or and just could not get past the first or minutes i was finally in the mood to watch it the other night let me say i am a big fan of ashley judd and i have loved every movie i have seen her in she did a great job as always just poor script writing it leaves a lot of questions unanswered such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms etc this fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point i may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something i missed 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show

movie is great this dvd release is horrible don t buy this seriously someone is bound to release a better version this is pan and scan cropped at and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape like a inch vhs there are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film and no it s not the print the film is fine it s the transfer cheap cheap cheap the compression is abysmal notice the obvious scan lines on the titles and the sound is piss poor how is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the us disgraceful 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
i won t buy it someone just today told me i should see this film what a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality dvds being produced by fox lorber oh well 
do not buy this film starts well but gets boring past the first mns despite winston s effects you can enjoy for about seconds in the whole movie and i guess for a few more seconds at the very end which i didn t even wait for though everything is well made in that film it doesn t have the least interest either to a horror fan or to the common viewer which i guess is the reason why you can find so many low priced copies of it on both dvd and vhs there are things that kill a horror film like having to hear a jazz piano chorus during a chase scene featuring a monster you don t even see anything of but the eyes of the actor who plays it then you already jumped to something else before anything actually happened and that s the way it is to the end 
snore don t let the cover fool you this film isn t half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it s my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove or at least something interesting to watch and it s not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy division new order happy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost came off as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i wouldn t call this bad it had it s good parts just not many 
kentucky fried movie i remember this movie back in the s as being much much funnier i bought it i saw it and i will never watch it again it is in the give away pil 
garbage this movie was really a waste of money the writing the directin are all very bad it is also very low budget which i thought would increase the realness but i was wrong safe your money and keep searchin 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
not what i hoped for i m a big fan of colin firth and i was disappointed of this movie i felt sleep wish i never do on an average good movie i do not recommended if you ve seen bridget jones diaries not even close 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
if only the movie would have followed the book this movie was awful that s all i can say about it it killed the book which happens to be one of my favorites when i got this movie after reading the book i excitedly stuck it in my vcr yes vcr no affordable dvd players at the time i was expecting so much more than what i received i know movies have to cut out a lot from the books to fit them into hours but i ve never before seen a movie cut out the main hero ! now that s just ridiculous ! if i were the author david baldacci i would be furious that my story had been so badly butchered clint eastwood had to be the star so he twisted the whole plot around to make luther whitney the hero when in the book luther whitney is gunned down half way though in the movie the book s hero jack graham is totally non existentmy advice to you if you re looking to buy a good movie look someplace else read the book sigh if only the movie would ve followed the book a little more closely it might have been a blockbuster hit too bad 
poor history and a screenplay over dramatic i m glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor over zealous and fanatic as was a common religious stance in those times promoted by both sides of the protestant catholic conflict she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes and throughout the film there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth no objectivity whatsoever i was sorely disappointed if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived i would recommend the superb bbc series elizabeth r with glenda jackson and if you want even further background look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary queen of scots although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it for example mary stuart and elizabeth never met although it was mary s great desire and even another title anne of the thousand days those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times this film just doesn t cut it 
i didn t like this movie i watched this movie called water and i hated it and thought it was terrible and boring and it just wasn t funny at all i like michael caine but i thought his talents were wasted in this movie ! the only good things about this movie are the beautiful carribean island location and the reggae music which is one of my favorite kinds of music but the plot doesn t do justice to the location and music 
sucks that s all you need to know it is terrible bad boring i could hardly finish it 
great cast no logic we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
yeah right ok so i am not a big vampire movie fan so maybe that had something to do with the fact that i thought this movie sucked but i am always open minded to all sorts of films so i thought i would give this one a whirl it started out with some potential but within the first minutes i knew it was going to be hopeless i should have just turned the darned thing off it was so unrealistic ok i know it s a vampire movie so what did i expect but i just didn t believe that the main character kerr would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie and then the girl izabella miko who had about lines in the movie that was just lame and pointless she must have felt like such a loser telling people yeah i m in this movie the forsaken and i m in it almost the entire time butahhhwell just call me zombie girl anyways i highly recommend a pass on this one unless you are a complete vampire fanatic 
almost unwatchable sci fi turkey this blatently derivative hat tip to ridley scott s alien with a hint of stanley donen s saturn thrown in movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over use of strobe lighting ever this makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is presumably employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills throw in a ridiculously precocious ship s computer and a downright silly robot and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space james spader and angela bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull the quothappy ever after quot finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness supernova s only redeeming factor is that it is very short 
pheelyp es a weeynie this is a ho hum buddy picture about a bunch of guys driving aimlessly around the west for one last fandango before they get drafted most of their time is spent ragging on one guy pheelyp to the point where one wonders why he is friends with the other three the peril of vietnam hangs in the background while these dopes carry on with their fake texas accents passable popcorn fun if you ve got nothing better to do 
politically correct retelling ruins the message although it looks the same as the hg wells story and the movie this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man s nature into a mildly fun sci fi outing alexander s motivation for building the time machine is entirely different and what he learns years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind that is if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time travel paradoxes so the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the george pal version we don t even find out anything about what we are about to see but things get worse is in the distant future although the writing tries to dance around the fact they have de fanged the harsh reality of the eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete instead of unknowing sheep they are new agey world culture pluralists the dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense and there is no rod taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts the only reason why i give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci fi films in years and i found some of the special fx the moon and jeremy irons cheesy as they may have been fun 
unforgettable unfortunately this movie survives in my memory for over years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one rare or better than this one as an example buffalo is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
garbage don t waste your time or money with this dvd the best part of the dvd is probably the trailers and most of those are garbage also my dvd came loose in the package and scratched too bad it didn t do any damage to ruin the movie i couldn t wait until the movie was over i would have stopped it earlier but wanted to see if any damage was done you ll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier the last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off don t waste your money spend it on the cheap horror dvd s because at least those can be somewhat entertaining 
starts out strong but fizzles quickly let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers weren t the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it s absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it s now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still didn t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they re cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language 
out of horrible q the winged serpent was one of the worst movies i have even seen i went into the film knowing it was a b movie but still wanting to be entertained i was not entertained for a film the gore in q the winged serpent probably shocked quite a few people there is also a scene that is quite enticing but aside from these two points of note the film offered little else including entertainment the acting was passable but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out the ok acting goes to waste save your money this is one of the worst movies ever made there are far better b movies it is the type of movie i would have liked in college in if i had been drunk and looking for laughs but this is and there are better bad movies with better gore and nudity you won t like q the winged serpent at all even for the drunk college student there are far better ways to spend minutes stay away total score out of out of enjoyment a rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film out of acting how good was the acting out of immersion did the movie suck me into the story out of intangibles special effects movie pace is the movie forgettable or something you will talk about and remember for weeks years out of must see is this movie worth seeing renting out of must buy is this movie a must buy purchase 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
snore don t let the cover fool you this film isn t half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it s my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove or at least something interesting to watch and it s not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy division new order happy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost came off as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i wouldn t call this bad it had it s good parts just not many 
attack of the ft pms woman not as good as the original but at least it is in color ! this was not one of daryl hannah s finest moment some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city over all the cast wasn t that good however if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you now we wait for the wasp woman to be remade ! 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
great acting but unbelievable story line this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting especially the girls playing christy and ariel is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but couldn t he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but can t find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i can t imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter s eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed

i love christmas movies but this one was both depressing and annoying from the back cover miracles do happen awardwinning actress mary steenburgen tvs joan of arcadia hope springs gives a solid performance as ginny grainger a young mother who rediscovers the joy and beauty of christmas thanks to the unshakeable faith of her six yearold daughter abbie elisabeth harnois and gideon harry dean stanton ginny s very own guardian angel ginny s wonderous experience will touch your heart and warm your soul in the timeless tradition of past disney favorites one magic christmas fulfills all your most treasured christmas fantasies share it with those you love and my review im such a sucker for christmas stuff i probably own more christmas books and movies than regular ones so this review is not from a bah humbug scrooge and i don t expect all of my christmas films to be happy happy joy joy all of the time my absolute favorite of all time is it s a wonderful life which can be very dark in places first off i don t think that the acting was bad in this movie and the cinematography was pretty good as well i made my judgment based on the content and the storyline which in my opinion flopped what i really found annoying was the way ginny the heroine was constantly being villified for example let me paint you a picture of her life her husband was laid off and hasn t worked in six months they have two young children she s making minimum wage and they re barely scraping by they ve also been evicted from their home since it s owned by her husband s previous employer and are forced to move in with her father inlaw they have very little saved in the bank and yet her husband wants to take out to buy christmas presents for the kids she understandably balks at the idea first of all is way too much to spend on presents for just two kids even if you re rich unless you want your kids to become spoiled ! remember this movie was originally made in so that number is even more outrageous plus they have only one meager paycheck to live on and no house of their own i think that she s being reasonable but she s painted as the bad guy for not blowing a bunch of their savings on toys then her husband wants to sink what little money they have into his own bike shop and possibly go into debt to own his own business again she s villified for being the only responsible one and telling her husband that he needs to get a steady job with a steady paycheck after all they may need their savings to survive this is not the time to be blowing it on dreams that may never pan out and usually don t since most small businesses fail in the first year but no she s shown to be a mean cold hearted witch for saying this grr it was just so irritating yes you want to give your kids a magical christmas yes the husband has always dreamed of owning his own shop but you have to be responsible especially when you have children to feed the clothe i don t think she was being a scrooge for wanting to be a responsible adult she did buy her kids resonably priced gifts after all but the film painted her as such and this film was so depressing it felt like the world was constantly kicking this family while it was down the happy ending was a long time in coming also i d be very hesitant to show this movie to impressionable young children i certainly wouldn t want one of my children to think that they can constantly disobey me run away from home in the middle of the night or talk to creepy looking strangers in trench coats that s how kids end up abducted or killed ! not really realistic i really expected better from disney especially when i really loved one of their other christmas movies the santa clause there are way better christmas movies out there see my list christmas movies that i watch every year for movies that are worth your time and money i don t recommend one magic christmas if you re still determined to watch it try to rent it first or you might find yourself upset that you wasted your money like i was 
rent before you buy there are not many movies i have switched off after the first minutes but this is one of them and i recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise 
unfunny and stupid i m going to weigh in on these dreadfully unfunny films these films are both stupid and terribly dated i can t understand how even a contemporary audience back in the s could enjoy this unfunny nonsense i wanted to stay til the end but i found myself fast forwarding because i just couldn t take it there is absolutely nothing funny about buster keaton or either of these terrible waste of time flicks 
contrary to most other reviews here this is not a good film i actually bought this film without seeing it first so overwhelmingly positive were most of the other reviews found here after watching about the first minutes both my fiancee and i were asking ourselves how could anyone think this film is good this is one of the worst films i ve ever watched the opening sequence is great but the rest of film moved at a snail s pace and the plot was absolutely pointless yes mulcahy s style is great as in his other films but he should have become a director of photography not a director of people while dolph is as good as dolph typically gets in a film the other actors were grade z cast offs although it was fun to see psycho from stripes working again as a security guard who delivered their lines as if they had memorized them five minutes before shooting there is barely any action during the remainder of the film and the flashback sequences show a plot which is just as lame as the story currently unfolding the female lead was simply not believable as a sniper i don t know how anybody was able to receive financing to film so stupid a story but i guess the direct todvd trade is only interested in making a profit of the same amount of money i paid for this film at wal mart i was very disappointed because i was all set to see a great lundgren movie and i m even madder at all the amazon com reviewers who whet my appetite with their great reviews jean claude van damme s newest flick derailed is even better than this piece of and i hated that movie 
just awful one of the worst movies i ve ever seen to begin with it butchers a classic book my kids were appalled when frightful the falcon was killed but beyond that everything about it is just awful screenplay acting direction music dream sequence totally amateur not one entertaining minute in the picture negative five stars 
an easy film to sum up just repeat the following several times draggy plot uninspired acting especially allen who almost sinks it unimaginative story direction etc then get a hitchcock film 
truth this film was funded by the centeral intelligence agency in the s and was maipulated to suit the need of a capitalistic propoganda machin 
senseless and absurd sorry can t finish this garbage movie is this girl retarded or what watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all how and why the garbage collecting turned cow feeder young guy would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer there s no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath the girl didn t look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless what life was too boring then what started becoming natural born killer give me a break bone chilling you can always say that again but won t make me care a bit more 
this film hasn t aged well when i first saw this film as a college student i thought it was ok but not great now that i ve seen it for the second time i don t even think it is ok i guess when i was younger i either missed or wasn t so bothered by the way robert redford s character treats barbara streisand s not to mention the way he treats his daughter he just leaves katie right at the point when he finds out she s pregnant with his child and at the end of the movie it appears that he has never kept in touch with either of them this bothered me to the point where i just couldn t have any sympathy or any positive views about redford s character and without this the movie doesn t work at all 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
once again a king story is ruined on film in the short story collection night shift mr king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least movies that i know of this mess trucks twice once by king as maximam overdrive and once as a t v movie night surf the boogyman not the new one graveyard shift the mangler and maybe more and not one has been done right ! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve he who walks behind the rows more like we steped in something behind the rows and we steped in this flameing piece of junk skip it 
speechless as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is this production was a waste of time space and money everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves the acting is bad the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff don t stink which it does badly it s not the worse movie i ve seen but it s surprisingly close please don t waste your time with this film 
buyer beware i was duped into thinking this was a music performance video it s nothing but a documentary about the s as a documentary it s great but definately not for a music buff musician like me who collects music videos 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
did it backwards ordered diva read reviews canceled order will someone please produce a dvd vhs re make of diva with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film i was so excited to finally find this movie but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it i hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they ll re issue a quality dvd and or video soon 
stop the world i want to get off five of six episodes of mini series orson welles created for british television the first episode takes place in st germain des pres in paris it opens with a very young art buchwald at the typewriter providing a typed narration of sorts the idea was jettisoned for the remaining episodes we catch a quick glance of jean cocteau and simone de beauvoir waving at the camera and running away most of the episode is taken up with welles interview of an old american expatriate in a tunic episode two takes place in london and splits its time between welles interviewing a handful of old women who live in a home for destitute widows and the chelsea pensioners retired soldiers interviewed in a pub episode three is a loving look at the madrid bullfight with much history and explanatory narration supplied by writer kenneth tynan and then wife elaine dundy episodes four and five take place in the land of the basques an aboriginal people living on the border of spain and france you can probably file this one under failed experiment in the first two episodes welles seems to think that the audience will find his tittering eccentrics as interesting as he does either that or more likely he went into this project without a plan or purpose and ran the camera at the first thing that wouldn t run away the third episode the bullfight seems to support this argument not only is it the only interesting episode it s the only one that seems to have been thought out beforehand why was bullfighting so popular in the s anyway the final two episodes show a real loss of whatever steam this project had marginally interesting to begin with episode five repeats two full scenes from episode four recommended only for die hard fans of orson welles

corny movie i admit that i m a die hard johnny depp fan but this wasn t anywhere near one of his best he is adorable in the movie but the plot is extremely corny and i found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of bikini sporting girls but not much else although there are a few remotely funny parts it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is but then again it was worth it to watch johnny 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
corny clunky a deserved turkey of the early s the rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around los angeles particularly the miracle mile area it s wafer thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that can t stand on its own two feet the plotting of the rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare unfortunately the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious worse still is the execution of the material every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma bill campbell ever hear of him anymore he overacts every single scene timothy dalton hammy jennifer connelly is the only one to come out unscathed the direction is beyond weak when the rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged so cloyingly goofy that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening add to this foul mixture a horrendous james horner score you get the idea still some nice set design and an effective animated film withinafilm make for a couple high points 
and now you see how our state was suckered into the oil biz i came upon this film while browsing my university library my curiosity was picqued since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking mardi gras and eating cajun food this film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in jean lafitte national park looking out over a marsh through which runs a large gas pipeline the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by exxonmobil shell texaco et al all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands if they re cleaning anything it s their own mess and what methods are they using biorestorative detonations i believe was the term used are those lifegiving bombs back to the film funded as propaganda by standard oil co when local sentiment was turning against the company i ll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled cajuns smile broadly at the blessed oil rig plopped in their marsh and the way the young boy is given the disney naturefilm treatment as amusingly naive as lobo the wolf or henry the mountain burro no just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state and then visit the beautiful scenery of norco la in the middle of the famed cancer alley 
will this horror ever end is it generally a rule that miniseries based off books have to suck so badly i ve seen a million tv miniseries based off novels that have sucked so horrendously but none like this get this straight before i continue i love the book version of the tommyknockers it s my alltime favorite stephen king novel secondfavorite the girl who loved tom gordon review to come later and i liked how it took the time to reveal key things about the plot how haven got started and the sowing and reaping the itinerant preacher got on with the virgins in the cornfield how gard and bobbi originally got to be such good friends more than that actually they dated for some time and what actually went on in the woods that unleashed the evil here bulls t utter bulls t here is why i think the movie sucked the series is only hours long what the f k a novel the size of the tommyknockers can t possibly be fit into a hour long series what about the minor stuff that although minor can t be taken out without a serious loss in credibility like hilly there wasn t much of him or his disappearing act with his little brother david and there certainly wasn t enough of his tenure at altair or their frantic search for his body and what about gard and how he opened up the hole to suck in his conniving ex poker buddy after getting cheated on a poker game that scene would have been amazing in the movie but no none of it the changes the authors made in the plotline seriously get some things at least partially right then change what you have to in order to fulfill whatever sick and twisted purpose you had in mind when changing the original but they take it too far example in the novel gard and bobbi s teeth originally fell out because of their becoming now nothing and the aliens themselves have a full set of teeth that part in the novel so why the insert obscenity here did they change it the only reason i gave this particular hellfest two stars is cause the original was made by stephen king no other reason if you are looking for a good time buy the damn book it s the real thing unlike this piece of s toverall starswhy for failure to be entertainin 
so many gaps in the story this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he s suffered in cuba and that s about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what s going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it s trying to convey it s lost in the plotless story 
disappointed this will only please the most ardent vampire fans why it s exceedinly poorly written i figured when i watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn t matter sadly it was neither don t get me wrong it was bad but in all of the wrong ways for example the writing plot dialog character development is basically not there well they are they re just about as interesting as chalk unfortunately the acting s not bad this results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie you can t laugh at the bad dialog because it isn t bad enough it s just flat and you can t laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it s acceptable it s got gore and blood but it isn t the least bit scary in general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of amityville horror to be released ryan reynolds may not play a vampire but that movie had more development in it s credits than this had in it s entirety 
wake up i agree where is the dvd for a soon to be obsolete format get real this is an excellent mini series on the worse medium 
dismayingly bad it s not just that if lucy fell is a bad film of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer directorstar eric schaeffer s nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday s roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he s cute speaks volumes 
embarassing performance by szeryng make no mistake i m a big fan of szeryng however he had a reputation of occasionally having one or more cocktails before a performance and in this video he appears to be lit up like a christmas tree and the result is sloppy and demeaning 
a priest struggling with faith this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film diary of a country priest with the french title of journal d un cur de campagne is one that i found to be boring despite my religious background it took me four tries to finish the film without falling asleep in this film a priest with health problems starts work at a church in rural france through his diary entries he reveals his crisis of faith and the way the villagers dislike him he later befriends a priest in a neighboring village and learns that he has cancer the film does have some nice scenery of norther france but that is about it the special features on the dvd are a theatrical trailer audio commentary by peter cowie and the standard essay about the film in the liner notes this film is recommend for those interested in the topic or for insomniacs 
whatever nazi s secretly in la with a blimp and a whole army this guy has a jet pack that shoots fire out of it but it never burns him it burns other things though totally stupid and wierd there is this super tall guy who is like soooo strong he bends people in half jetpacked germans taking over usa give me a break 
tiresome the story of o attempts to defy the wisdom of the commandments of hot movies and fails i won t bore you with all of the commandments just thou shalt not make a hot movie with an entire cast of non hot actors shot in that hazy sometimes dreamy kind of way that i dislike tsoo is about a rich guy who sends his girlfriend to a mansion where unattractive masters train unattractive slaves how to be obedient after graduation the rich guy loses his woman to his older much older step brotherother stuff happens banging branding eating talking talking talking whipping but it s all unimportant and not hot 
you never know who they really are but you do clownhouse is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor while hearing of salva s conviction when jeepers creepers came out i never knew it had anything to do with this movie nor had i ever heard of this in the first place i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides it and came across this weird little halloweenlike suspense tale while the sex scandal never once popped into my head except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid i still didn t care for this too much despite its pluses like halloween this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out but sadly it didn t really get to me if i was about or so this would ve scared the hell out of me i m not saying i hated this it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children it lost some effect for me i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on and it would ve been a creepier experience horror movie fans should like this even though i personally thought it would be better the atmosphere is very very creepy and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way but it just didn t do it for me rent it first 
sentimental and fake having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i can t fathom the entire plot is self serving shallow and unrealistic i guess it s supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i don t condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who don t get it and it doesn t mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the writer director gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you can t keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it s not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that wouldn t bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself 
silly claptrap ridiculous laughable ! written by a patriarchial mentality if a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants then a man must ask a woman no man understands women ! the only woman who could be explained by this nonsense is one who s been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy and there are quite a few of that type in america and in saudi arabia and in afghanistan and for a book that does explain women to both women and men see simon de beauvoir s the second sex excellent text i ve read and reread it many times with greeat benefit 
plot holes the first half hour of this minute movie is actually quite good in fact it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don t know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates she was however but we the audience don t know that however the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam is unexplained especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin however it turns out she isn t so that s why the movie lasts longer than minutes fortunately we re not dealing with unwanted pregnancies either so this doesn t turn into a soap opera however we do have the dreamboat hero who dreams up the rumor about her being raped and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that s true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film dreamboat takes the turn as lead character and it s his story we re following whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film and basically it s her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out dreamboat and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out and everyone else in a way the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth though the characters don t have the same truth in mind it s about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it s not the comic book variety isn t fun for an audience it s just distasteful in other words the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first half hour and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved it might be worth viewing if only once but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that s the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip or in this case deliberate lies is that what goes around comes around and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first min then quit midway but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once just to be sure where this is headed 
power i could not get interested in this movie it was slow moving and boring 
where dvd i m going nuts here i might be in a slightly foul mood on account of my having just returned from a shopping experience which resulted in my receiving a parking ticket but i used to watch kb s hamlet on a fairly regular basis whether is was on cable or vhs i found i could never get enough i signed the petition i m one of those people who s written letters in the hopes they ll actually make a difference that said where is the frikkin dvd i mean has anybody else noticed that kb s hamlet has already missed the dvd boat while the world is moving toward hd dvd we still have yet to see a sign of the stupid thing i haven t owned a vcr since back before amazon even really existed or was at least widely known i was an early adopter of dvd now years later years after the first time i inquired about this release i still can t believe it isn t out reality check people forbidden planet fine movie though it may have been and in context of this discussion as beneath its sci fi exterior one can find an interesting retelling of the tempest it s gone from film decades before i was born to vhs beta to dvd and now to hd dvdwhy is it that a film like forbidden frikkin planet gets pushed up through the years and transferred over and over again to the latest medium when the finest version of hamlet ever produced for the screen has been left behind whats going on is kb being held at gunpoint by mel gibson s handlers is there blackmail involved did kb contract george lucas to add a bunch of cgi ewoks to each scene cause i can t figure out for the life of me why we haven t seen this stupid thing yet was it that hard to commit it to vhs it seems to me that it was readily and easily done so what s the deal with dvd is the money just not good enough mr branagh i realize that your talents lie in theater rather than finances but of zero is zero it makes me wonder then is it some artistic issue when transferred to the higher fidelity formats of dvd and hd dvd are there imperfections present that were undetectable when the film was out in vhs format can we see more clearly how charleton heston s weird teeth have yellowed and browned over the years and formed into this strange rolling dental pattern greatly in need of modern dentistry my dentist could set those teeth painlessly over a four month period without the use of orthodontics for years i ve wondered about this college came and went i ve moved to three different continents my own career has gone from peon to mr importantpants and yet we are still without even a dvd version of hamlet yes i realize there s a version of the film available for digitital download but please don t make me any more uppity than i already am i want the film and i want it in its full glory with proper aspect ratio and preferably on hd dvd so i can see it in all its glory which would be especially nice considering the mm film used to record this sucker i hate to give what is easily the best film version of hamlet ever produced and no this point is not open to argument it s not an opinion but rather a scientifically proven fact one star but given that the man and his peeps have had over a decade to get the job done i think it s really just about time to see it hitting store shelves if it is hitting shelves by the by i apologize for the rant but i m tired of waiting i want to see this movie on a disc before i die widescreenpreferably hd i don t care about the bonus materials you can keep em if thats what s taking so long but just get some dummy college intern to do the transfer and throw together a dvd menu if it can be done for forbidden planet then it can be done for hamlet i have spoken and i am awesome 
no information no pictures the film shows no action except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body and you ask yourself in what relation to the subject of the film this stands sorry forgot the secondsceen of a naked young man just the head of yearold lads who wonder why they got infected when they work as prostitute explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in prag like advertising you are provided with not the least background information about their education why they left their home town why they have no normal job i would wonder what politics think and do about the youth in the new ec country what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school and what other chances they have in life 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
historical interpretaion at its worst this film may possibly be the worst about this topic ever made the performances are terrible particularly lance henrikson as lincoln he appears to be doing an impersonation of gregory peck playing lincoln and a very bad one at that the portrayal of booth seems to come about from the makers of this film watching too many s serial killer shockers i particaularly like the scene where morrow is wearing granny sunglasses that make him look like a reject from strawberry alarm clock his portrayal of booth as the crazed maniac is laughable the sets however are very credible and appealing overall a terrible film avoid it unless you are in the mood for a good laugh 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
not a definite favorite i don t like the fact that somebody can take a horror movie and turn it into a joke i couldn t even get through this movie once i just don t like films that express monsters as four legged dog creatures the relic is a story about a ritual gone wrong when some foolish explorer actually drinks this weird concoction from a tribe of indians mysteriously enough the liquid turns him into a beastly creature that lives in the sewers under a mansion dont get this movie 
this movie is a clunker wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters 
worthless western the claim purports to be an adaptation of thomas hardy s classic novel the mayor of casterbridge transplanted to the old west the producers clearly wanted the claim to be accepted as a literate western and it is clear that the critics fell for it however as anyone who has read the original hardy novel can tell you the movie fails as a hardy adaptation meanwhile any fan of movie westerns can tell you that the claim is a failure in that department as well the claim begins in where daniel dillon peter mullan lords supreme over his company town his gold mining company is a topflight operation dillon is easily one of the most admired men in california if not in the nation however dillon is not a terribly happy man deep down he broods over a dark secret that if exposed could lead to the destruction of his reputation you see the gold claim was originally made by another man but dillon sold his wife and daughter to the original claimant in exchange for the claim the prospector thereupon took both wife and child to boston and raised the family there meanwhile dillon ruthlessly exploited the gold claim to become one of the richest men in all of california needless to say if it became public knowldege that dillon s success was based on the sale of human beings that would be nothing short of disastrous matters are brought to a head when his wife nastassja kinski daughter milla jovovich and his wife s subsequent daughter with the other man sarah polley show up in town and request that he take them in as his family just when you think that things are going to get interesting the rug is pulled out from the audience s feet when it is revealed that dillon conveniently never married after making his dirty deal this enabled him to marry his ex wife without never having to publically admit that they were previously married or what happened to that union this effectively removed all dramatic tension and helped make the claim a colossal bore 
horrible i was forced to watch this movie for college it was the most vulgar unnecessary piece of junk i have ever seen this is a perfect example of the demoralization of america 
no point very blank as i recall was not the most prolific year for movies and point blank in my opinion would be one of the worst films i have ever watched notwithstanding the very violent nature of the film the acting by such notables as lee marvin carroll o conner and angie dickinson continually appear to search for conviction with their dis jointed and nonsensical dialogue flashbacks san quentin the san francisco skyline cannot save this film from the trash heap of celluloid history if your a lee marvin fan better to watch the man who shot libery valance twice than waste your time on point blank your disposition will be better for it 
give your fast forward a work out let s just be honest this film is terrible and not in the way that attack of the killer tomatoes is so terrible that it s great more like the way caddyshack ii is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame i was a kid when this film was released and while it was not particularly exciting then it is insanely tedious now it is a genuine test of patience but with no pay off what soeverheres some potentially helpful information the slasher film can branch in two directions supernatural friday the th ii halloween nightmare on elm street etc and crime revenge i spit on your grave friday the th tcm scream urban legend ect this one falls under the latter heading and while realism can render a more potent effect this could really happen ! this film simply fails to engage the viewer on any level the goal of a slasher film is two fold to horrify and repulse this does neither the horror element is non existent there is no point in expounding since there is nothing to examine and if you love gore and who doesn t try another film the murders are barely visible literally and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn many of the film s problems are technical the cinematography is just horrendous the entirely film is extremely underlit the colors are needlessly washed out and the film stock is grade f and this as you know is not because the film is over twenty five years old the problem was always there there is one good moment in the entire film when the school s bad boy has his head lopped off and it clumsily thunks down the prom court walk way still it is more comic relief than genuine horror the soundtrack could not be worse i am not referring to the disco tunes we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period but the tracks made for the film they sound like they were squeaked out by the carpenters so imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster psuedo thoughtful ballads like the final song on the track words cannot explain how wildly offensive it is ! did i mention that leslie nielson has a meaty role yes that leslie nielsen from airplane and naked gun he plays a tough minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter i know it sounds funny but it s not trust me ! if you dig watching unattractive teenagers disco the night away hey this film is totally for you but if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle period of its reign look elsewhere like halloween friday the th etc id be willing to get all ed mcmahon s star search on you and give this film a star but it is an important milestone in the slasher sub genre i will not spoil the film and tell you why though so if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar watch it on picture inpicture maybe after a few drinks on a day when the cable is out on fast forward 
profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much touted play watching the first fifteen minutes of heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads is colossal torture like status elipticus it s suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen having hopes it might pick up that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums don t take my word for it watch it yourself and see 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters

this movie ruined my life bad moon begins in some south american country where michael pare and his girlfriend are attacked by a werewolf the movie stumbles quickly into the perspective of thor a wonderfully loyal german shepherd owned by mariel hemingway whom i tend to think is kind of scary looking with her weird cheekbones and her sunken eyes and her son the little boy who played dennis the menace michael pare who is mariel s brother soon comes into the picture struggling to come to grips with the attack and his living a life as a werewolf at first you feel pity for his character i mean the guy witnessed his lover attacked and eaten by a monster and is now himself living the life of the beast but you soon feel nothing but disgust and hatred towards the man when he decides to have a mental battle with thor the movie was scary and tense in parts and the gore factor was high but i had such a hard time with some scenes in the film i was very disturbed by the scene where michael pare s character entices thor to bite him therefore getting thor hauled off by animal control people in a truly heartwrenching scene that still to this day makes me sick the movie is good in some aspects the directing is good and you truly fear for the people in the situations they are in the creature effects are excellent and i much rather prefer costume physical makeup werewolves over the newer van helsing type werewolf that cgi designs have come up with there is nothing worse than a computer animated werewolf just watch the movie cursed to see what i mean this movie to me is all about watching a poor territorial dog who wants to protect his owners get pushed around the cgi in this movie was awful just because it was and cgi was pretty much new to movies at that time so the transformation scene in the end was a crapfest the hero of the movie thor is what i am giving this movie stars for because the dog really does pull through for the viewer and make them care you kind of watch the movie only for the dog you want the dog to live and get through it and almost could care less about the family by the end of the film overall the movie was scary and the werewolf was pretty good compared to some of the crap that has been out there in the past but the dog getting knocked around and tortured throughout the movie was enough to ruin my life forever at least the ending was somewhat happy i was somewhat confused by the dream she had but it seems to end with everything alright oh well the movie was decent but could have been longer and could have had less traumatic incidents involving the dog 
d tv no it s certainly not as good as the first one but i did enjoy some of demons the beginning is cool enough with the demon s resurrection and it s gaining access into sally s apartment via the tv set the tension and dread seem to build quite nicely that is right up to the scene where the kid demons chest pops open to reveal an idiotic rubber demon puppet ! ugg ! it reminded me of those stupid monsters in ghoulies hobgoblin or some other wretched s mess ! the apartment building setting was interesting but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few precious bursts of action we actually get i did like the weightlifter folks in the gym they were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders ! the battle in the parking garage was ok too maybe i just expected d to be a bit more frightening and disturbing 
not having goodtimes with goodtimes home video futureworld is really not a bad follow up to westworld but goodtimes home video makes viewing this film a very bad time the only thing good about it is seeing yul brynner back if this is the only way we can get to see him he was very good if only for a short segment in this film hard to recommend this version at all 
get real quite possibly the stupidest movie ever made wellwrittencould have fooled me artfully shot i guess it had its moments especially if you like a lot of very black shadows covering most of what you want to see but the rest of it is no better than the standards of crappy s tv finely edited i guess there s an art to cutting a real turkeynot a campfest not a comedy just plain bad get some busty dolls and some dopey guys throw them in a stew show some teasers of the breasts add a cheesy dashed off script by a guy who suddenly exemplars do as i say not as i do and plan on it becoming a cult classic this is not the rocky horror picture show and you d have so much more fun watching that one again instead roger ebert do you really chuckle when you remember this one claim to movie making fame i thought your profession was about helping people to not waste their time you sure wasted mine 
paris when it fizzles in when this movie came out in the theaters the reviews it got were not good i was at the time and remember my mother reading about it in the newspaper and the headline for this movie was paris when it fizzles there was little chemistry between hepburn and holden when i finally saw the movie they were right i simply like both actors mainly because i liked them in sabrina but like the critics said it fizzled 
bo ring possibly one of the worst movies ever made bo and john derek managed to massacre the tarzan legend while wreaking cinematic havoc with this unbelievably bad waste of celluloid where to begin the lousy script the poopy cinematography the atrocious acting i can t think of enough adjectives to describe how putrid this actually is as for erotic forget it jane should have boffed the ape instead jane and papa head through the jungle delayed by her repeated falls into the river despite the time period when women were supposed to be modest jane doesn t seem to know what underwear is yeesh i can t believe people actually paid to see this tripe if you must watch it rent it and save some you ll be glad you di 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
kathy smith pregnancy workout i am a big fan of kathy smith but this video is quite outdated i don t know the date but guessing late s the workout is fine but wish i bought something more up to date since so much about pregnancy fitness has changed in the last years in the middle of the workout there is an unnecessary pause where kathy and the others in the video stop to perform a rap song awfully silly and waste of precious time ! 
spinal tap goes folk a mighty wind seems to be this is spinal tap done in a folk medium unfortunately the gags and cliches in this film seem to be lifted as another reviewer stated from most of christopher guest s previous efforts to put it mildly halfway through the film i was half asleep and wishing a dwarf would crush stonehenge

poor jayne what a waste the las vegas hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars jayne mansfield mamie van buren and ferlin huskey it appears to be a low budget film due to the photography acting and settings if you are a jayne or mamie fan you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only one highlight of the film is ferlin husky s dream sequence of jayne singing that makes it air time of jayne is very small trivia the siamese cat in the film which jayne is holding belonged to jayne s friend may mann 
awful i rented this movie from netflix recently expecting a wonderfully campy cheesy horror film wrong its just an hour and a half of boring film the plot is lacking the characters are annoying especially duane its simply a ridiculous film

was this review helpful to you celine dion is the bomb how like the bomb in this dvf is the bomb celine hee was this review helpful to you well 
befuddled i am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie it is merely a monument to hollywood s stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale in dumas s book the count learns that he cannot play god dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life he abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful god hollywood gives us instead triumphant revenge 
my friend i saw this in the s and i can remember some of the scenes to this day im now i was my friend at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i didn tfor a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what s considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horrorandbrutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved

why bother i find myself rehashing my own reviews at this point but nonetheless i aspire to write a review on each instalment producers have tested logistics to new levels by taking jason on a murderous vacation to new york the film begins on camp crystal where two teenage lovers are discussing the legend of jason whilst they speak of him jason is electrocuted again back to life by the contact of the boat s anchor more conveniently he finds a hockey mask on the boat to cover up his unsightly face cue two dead teens with very bad gory effects and jason s off on his way to new york cue once again a series of brutal murders on the boat with female heroine jensen dagett avoiding him at all costs until he reaches new york shores as a side story the heroine has had previous contact with jason when she is swimming in the water so she is frightened of the water as a result at this stage a change of scenery was needed but it doesn t work well at all what s so scary in new york comedy is used to no effect in this movie and again the death scenes are more elaborate can this unlucky lady stop jason in his tracks one more time will this beast ever die i rest my case 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
if you re a school teacher and thinking about using this film in your class please read this first whether william golding deserved nobel prize or not is still a debatable point but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book and its name is lord of the flies but let s not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while because after all no one i am afraid can bring the multi layered world of words onto the screen even those who loved the version would admit that you can interpret the meaning of lord of the flies but who can really visualize it or the imaginary conversations of simon for that matter the biggest problem of harry hook s new version is not the changes done to the film the boys are american military school cadets using dirty words frequently but those parts didn t annoy me much real problem is something more essential to the film which is storytelling in short the film doesn t know what it wants to be on the film s video cover you can read and i quote this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul well not exactly for as adventure story it lacks pace the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing as allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character the conflict between ralph and jack should be clearer and piggy s role should be more than that of a whining fat boy and don t forget simon who sees things it is true but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us it is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful it could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop opposite of optimistic tales of jules verne s adventure stories by watching this film you can follow the story of the book but find no tension or thought provoking words in it balthazar getty s feature film debut and lewis m allen one of the producers of the film had also produced peter brook version in 
you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer

embarassing performance by szeryng make no mistake i m a big fan of szeryng however he had a reputation of occasionally having one or more cocktails before a performance and in this video he appears to be lit up like a christmas tree and the result is sloppy and demeaning 
lost souls the rules of attraction lost soulsamos lassen and cinema pridethe rules of attraction is a twisted story about sex drugs and college life three students at camden college are involved in a love triangle sean bateman a womanizing drug dealer is love with lauren a virgin but who is more infatuated with her ex boyfriend then there is paul who is bisexual and used to date lauren before he came out paul however is interested in sean who he thinks is bisexual throw in a bunch of other characters and you have a mess in fact everyone in this money is suffering from some kind of problem and each is only looking out for him or herself we can tell right away that no good can come from these people and we are told so right in the beginning as the first scene of the movie is the end of the story and the rest of the movie tells us how we got to that point in fact a more apt name for this movie would be les miserables as that is what everyone turns out to be in reality the film is a satire of those crazy teen movies like american pie and theres something about mary if we look at the movie like this it is ingenious if on the other hand we look at it as just a movie it bombs the characters are not the kind of people that you would want to call friends but that does not mean they are not interesting the problem with them is that we all know someone like them and they are realistic without the acting this film does not move and the cast manages to succeed at that for a young cast the acting is good better than what i had expected his direction however is highly stylized and the tricks that roger avary employs just do not always work but by and large when i consider what he had to work with his job is admirable i think a lot of people were expecting a fluff movie with a young cast and what they got is a dark and realistic movie it destroys some of the myths about drugs and college life and because of this the movie has been deemed offensive by many the treason for the offense is that many cannot understand that there are really this shallow who have no feeling there seems to be no narrative focus no beginning and no end and the focus is on a group of selfish ambiguous characters who traffic in rape drugs and homosexuality and general obsessions we don t see smiling happy college kids rather we are given kids who have problems and they aren t pretty problems either the characters are lost souls pathetic people that we do not want to emulate there is no resolution there is no love everything seems to be overdone and excessive the first time i watched the film i thought that my distrust in humanity had been validated and that perhaps i should consider becoming a loner the characters are vile and horrible and not much more than amalgams of the worst that society has to offer the only character that elicits sympathy dies right way the satire on wasted youth never quite reaches its conclusion and comes off more as sour grapes on the other hand the movie can be classified as brilliant it was true to the novel from which it was adapted and resented real characters even if we d not want to admit that people like this really exist we are not supposed to like these people because they are too much into not being attached to anyone or to themselves on first viewing i found the whole movie to be an appalling mess on second viewing i eased up a bit and by the third viewing i was really into it but then if it takes three viewings to appreciate a movie i wonder if it is worth the effort it is a challenging film when sex means no more than a handshake you want to question our value system likewise i am still questioning the rules of attraction maybe one day i will shout its praises right now i am not in the mood for a fourth viewing 
for song dance fans only the band wagon is one of the ny times best films ever made and i ve seen about of them you may be a big fan of the traditional hollywood musical and if so this is your kind of film personally the list of such films i ve enjoyed is quite short and it doesn t include the band wagon this makes me sad having just enjoyed fred ginger s classic swing time from the ny times list however where that film and gene kelly s singin in the rain excel by sparkling between the song dance numbers the band wagon lags it s a shame because there are a couple of brilliant moments here the sparkling shoe shine dance on a set representing nd street and a lovely number with cyd charisse to dancing in the dark other than that and other than jack buchanan s comical turn as a master thespian the whole thing just leaves me flat especially the blah romance and idiotically cornball ending give me fiddler on the roof or those named above any day over this 
land of oprahisms having avoided seeing this film i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on brought tuesdayunbiden into our home my aversion to oprah and her ilk does not cloud my dislike of this film a bad film is a bad film devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned and directionless directing this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward something should occur my interest should be engaged this film takes reams of pre packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses and attempts to build the plot from words alone it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said heythis book is full of words lets make a movie in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting to be honest jack lemmon was not very good in this film he played the same character he always did just older hank azaria was just awful he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones and was wooden and expressionless maybe he was too embarrased to be there as to the other actor s well they filled up the space nicely the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was they even covered the green leaves on the trees some better acting some good r rated dialogue and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film as it stands however it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr phil etc the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases a good cry and a genial talk show presenter will somehow make it all better ifor one think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial then pull the finger out and just get on with it to the grammar and form police i did have this in paragraphs but the editing process scrunched it all together sorry 
not a horror movie except for the fact it is a horror to watch sstephen king can blame no one but himself for this missfire of a movie because he wrote this junk ! never finds it s feet horror comedydramafantasyadventureand even thriller it tries to be all and fails at each one skip it ! 
disappointed i ordered your movie hometown legend from cbd because it was portrayed as an inspirational family movie since my year old loves football and the most recent football movies at the theaters are not for kids i was thrilled to see this movie advertised w the jenkins name on it imagine my surprise when it arrived and i saw that it was rated pg for language i searched the internet however and everything i read said it had no bad language in it so we watched it i guess by today s standards your movie would be labeled tame but by god s standards i found it disturbing i just can t believe that you spent minutes who knows how much money to make a godless movie aren t there enough of those out there sure god was mentioned but only in passing and in my opinion quite sarcastically and not as king of kings lord of lords ! there were only a couple swear words but quite a few places of crude humor as well as a teen love story need i mention the teen girl s attire why were you trying to appeal to the unsaved audience isn t that what s wrong w our churches in this country unsaved people don t want to watch movies just like their own they want to see a difference ! why didn t you make a difference i can t believe that i read review after review parading this movie as a great christian movie i just don t see it to me it was a lame attempt at making a feel good movie w just a tad enough religion so that it could be called christian but just enough of the world that it would appeal to them i believe in the bible that is deemed lukewarm i bought this movie because i believed it would be a movie my son would watch over and over however that is not the case i m saddened that christianity seems to be watered down in our country and even more sad that the very people i thought were helping the cause of christ aren t doing that at all at least not w this movie the bottom line is i expect what i saw from disney but not from you what a missed opportunity ! 
insert pun with word con here con express has lots of action in it which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately the action isn t enough and in between stunt pieces and shoot outs the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions isn t really known for producing films of the highest quality so usually i go easy on them if this were a big budget company producing this i d be inclined to pan it entirely but i wasn t expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is for the most part pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over thetop bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege con air spy game and speed if you liked those you probably won t mind this one too much just go easy on it 
wish i had not bought this i guess studio time must be very expensive cause denise austin rushes through the exercises like the set is on fire maybe if she had cut down the intro there would have been more time for exercising it seems a little disjointed with the constant change from floor to standing exercises before you can get to the floor the exercisers are on rep or then it s back up again theres a lot of talking going on with exhortions to sqeeze sqeeze sqeeze perky is an understatement 
boooriiiiiing i want the two hours of my life back after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in that time is past even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your s and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated ! 
not worth the time save your money this is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic i hadn t read the book before seeing the movie the film stunk a few years later i read the book and was enchanted i did not make the connection that this was the same story until i saw the film again on late night tv i was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen then i realized what movie it was i tried to sit through it i just couldn t the monster should have eaten the film 
there are worse things than forgetting when i first saw the previews i thought that it looked very interesting and could be a good movie of course i thought the same about white noise i guess the lesson here is that hollywood has trouble making a good movie from beginning to end like the sixth sense i think hollywood is more interested in making a good trailer than they are a good movie so they can make a lot of money in the box office the forgotten is no exception the first half an hour or so is very good and joseph ruben creates a creepy atmosphere with good performances from julianne moore and dominic west however the movie quickly begins to fall apart like white noise and becomes less and less believable i was hoping for a logical explanation especially since the box of the movie read the biggest jaw dropper since the sixth sense however the explanation is flimsy and unrealistic and my jaw only dropped at how ridiculous it was nothing at all like when the ending came for sixth sense i bought this movie for so i can t complain but so much but am still amazed at hollywood still struggles to make an entertaining cohesive movie without so many holes the only thing that is forgotten is i have forgotten when creepy psychological movies were good 
different yet hollywood ruined it i am kind of in the middle of the other reviewers it did have a different and unpredictable story line i took it that he was dreaming since the state names and money werent real the kid was great the problem as usual is hollywood ruined it what could have been a great movie my kids could watch they throw in a sex scene in the kid s car back seat while he is sitting next to the car and then of course they have to have the kid throw in a couple of f words and of course hollywood doesnt let us who object to that buy a version that has that edited or permit dvd players that allow you to skip those parts if it wasnt for the trash above i would give it stars for its uniqueness if you are morale and have children you dont want this movie 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
i bought my dvd copy from amazon i love sophia loren as an actress however this dvd as movies in one package is a very very very poor quality dvd colors are bad picture is bad and the sound is even worse don t waste your money my dvd copy was bought from amazon this is my advic 
makes no sense if i could give this movie less than star i would the central character ryan played by jason scott lee by the way what happened to the muscles from brussels is a loser why because he saves adolf hitler s life and how does he do this by killing the leading lady gee great script guys also the thing makes no sense people are obliterated from history and ryan knows about it ! hello if they were removed from history he would have no memory of them duh if there was such a thing as a time cop they would outlaw people wasting hrs watching this ridiculous movie ! 
coming clean playboy asks why this movie hasn t become a cult classic i ll tell you first of all the painting on the cover does not look like the actual woman in the film one or two of the reviewers liked the way she looks okay to each his own but don t be surprised if you find her unattractive second the nudity no she is not nude all the time nor half the time nor a fourth of the time nor she s nude a few seconds now and then no more than any other movie third the movie is only minutes and the first four of them are skippable the movie is mostly a man fighting with a neanderthal survivor both behave more childishly than primitively you ll see more convincing behavior in clan of the cave bear there are no explicit sex scenes also no effective sex scenes of any kind even the fight scenes are disappointing oh and did i mention that the dialogue is a joke bottom line for almost every viewer this movie will not be worth watching even once 
super teen having been a teenager once i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however in pump up the volume the movie s attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero well played by christian slater cannot communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he doesn t use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim he treats the caller as someone who isn t serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure but isn t he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry folks been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives as none of these teens do merely escalates the generational gap and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
i ve seen it all before this tour did nothing for me i won t lie when i say the visuals were appealing to look at with britney in her cute clothes and stage sets but she totally rips off janet jackson with her dancing style of dress and so forth so i don t understand why little teenagers like her and won t give ms jackson the time of day when she s the one who did it better than her i got a sense of deja vu when i watched bits of this show i felt that she purposely stole elements from the janet velvet rope and all for you tours such as the costumes ! janet s all for you tour madonna s drowned world tour and even michael jackson s th anniversary concert were far more entertaining in and way more superior than this garbage this garbage just goes to show that young pretty stars are given more attention than those who actually have more talent that shines even without all the special effects in the world 
if i could give this movie less than star i would this movie is the worst piece of clap trap that i have ever seen built in the mold of the rambo series the film tries to play off of the west s fear of the soviet union you d be better of watching a quothow to pour milk quot instructional video than watch this film that will make you less smart 
unable to review unable to see the movie received the original shipment and later a replacement and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
watch this wartime l amp h comedy with a group of friends some comedies come to life with an audience quotair raid wardens quot is a real quotaudiencequot picture with stan and ollie bumbling their way through air raid duty first aid practice and spy catching as usual with laurel amp hardy you can see the jokes coming audiences loved this underrated film in it s got some good scenes but you ll either admire or hate the quotsadquot episodes where the boys have to play it straight 
swept from the sea i hated hated hated hated this movie it didn t make sense to me to depresssing 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
what okay my wife and i just watched this yesterday and i have to say i m shocked to see all the good reviews i was almost in tears i was so bored it was like a really bad madefortv movie ! i swear if it weren t for the chemistry between bette midler and dennis farina it would have been a complete waste of time at least they were funny and natural and believable their daughter played by paula marshall was terrible the whole story was ruined by horrid acting the two leads aside and crappy dialog when we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot about a divorced couple played by midler and farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable boy were we wrong this has got to be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen don t waste your time 
superficial whatever happened to the glory days of french cinema like truffaut godard etc now replaced by unimaginative realists of the type represented in this movie from the cardboard cutout characters to the inane plot this is a film that only teenage girls of and a half could empathize with this film doesn t tell you anything you haven t seen before in the coming of age category oh the confusion the tears the lousy sex the intolerant parents etc etc the only redeeming feature is the actresses who do a brave job with the atrocious screenplay 
oh the humanity there are bad movies and then there are bad movies universal soldier the return is a cosmically bad movie a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to manos the hands of fate for comparison the first universal soldier film was a moderately entertaining shoot em up flick starring action stars jean claude van damme and rocky refugee dolph lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do people perished in violent ways stuff exploded and van damme and lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film even the presence of the charming ally walker as van damme s female sidekick greatly helped the film the movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition dvd some time back it unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel the second and one hopes final installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that i sat in open mouthed awe watching it i think i can safely say i am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll van damme returns as luc the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film on this outing he now works for dr dylan cotner xander berkeley a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer s eth luc with his female sidekick maggie kiana tom helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers the film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse pounding jaunt up a river a jaunt filled with explosions stunts gunfire and the briefest glimpse of tom s incredibly fit form as the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things kiana tom is incredibly hot but can t act her way out of a paper bag luc has a daughter named hillary karis paige bryant who you just know will get into trouble at some point and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are romeo bill goldberg and the one played by michael jai white frankly turning off the film immediately after glimpsing tom s amazing physique is probably a good thing everything that follows is dull predictable and so full of plot holes as to defy description universal soldier the return feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film sure enough cotner s computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers in the resulting conflagration s eth implants its consciousness in michael jai white luc and his loved ones flee from the compound and the military swoops in to contain the problem an extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called erin who is interested in exposing the government s latest shenanigans predictably van damme and schanz team up to track down erwell track down something to defeat the supercomputer i think they need some code to shut the system down but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse luc can hand out even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult s only club can t make this turkey fly it s dull folks and painfully so by the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between luc and s eth back at the shattered compound with an injured hillary s life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed luc geez what a surprise there i knew i just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck how bad can it be you ask read on plot holes in this film are innumerable as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager s face for example luc explains to erin that he was once a universal soldier just like romeo but cotner cured him by restoring him to life he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers what the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications he brought someone back from the dead ! how exactly did he accomplish this feat we don t find out from van damme who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications i could go on but let s discuss the performances instead or the lack thereof i should say i adore kiana tom she s a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth s rotation but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth another problem is the lumbering bill goldberg whose funny lines are anything but and the more i think about heidi schanz the less i think of her you have to wonder about a film where jean claude van damme is the best thespian in the cast you might think a movie this foolhardy shouldn t contain any bonus features on dvd you would be wrong trailers for this film the return double team desert heat knock off maximum risk and nowhere to run showcase the dubious career of jean claude van damme a making of feature a van damme career retrospective ha a michael jai white feature and talent bios round out the disc my advice to those viewers thinking of renting universal soldier the return run my friends run far far away and don t look back 
worth watching the movie is not good but a lot can be learned by watching it through even though it drags the s babe played by jayne is a period piece but having lived in las vegas for the past five years i can tell the readers of this review that the type is alive and well in this city the film is about a certain niche created by men and probably by religion too and into this niche women step and become stigmatized the whore or babe is like the witch in the medieval period something demonic and devilish i assure you the values in the film are not out ofdate the movie also is an interesting source of info about ethnicity and regionalism espec italian and the nyc area and you see in this a connection to las vegas too the film if it teaches anything teaches us that we are far less emancipated liberated rational liberal etc in regard to sex and to women than we thought we were again the parallel to witchcraft is a good one naive liberals thought the witch hunting was over in the early s in fact witches were burned in all major european ocuntries into the late s and s babes a la mansfield are not only the adult identity of many especially in las vegas in the year but are probably the role models of and year olds 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
woody s worst my wife and i are great woody allen fans while we have most of his movies this is one we missed based on the high amazon ratings we ordered it what a dog of a movie ! michael j fox dom deluise and the girl playing woody s daughter stink their combined horrible acting brings down the movie casting fox in this role is beyond comprehension ! his acting was pathedtic he couldn t stand still for even a few seconds in a scene woody should have burned all copies since this leaves a bad taste for his other great films save your money on this one clearly it is woody s worst ! i never trust those five star ratings again 
calling this the worst horror movie is kind this is movie is a nice big pile of warm doo doo there nothing entertaining about this film horrible acting and serious over acting are just the beginning to this mess no story to be found super bad special fx i mean u can see raw meat toss about and the new guinea zombies look like brothers and sisters u find in compton california and adding stock footage is plan lazy i don t know if the person who directed this still alive if he is he should be made to work at mcdonald s making fries for lif

great horses movie is horrible but horses are fabulous ! this is some of the best footage of the fabled andalusian horses i ve ever seen if there s more out there somebody please let me know ! bought the movie just to see the horses 
offensive this is one of the most offensive and anti gay movies i have ever seen don t let the title or the box fool you every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment i was shocked that such a film could come out of france if you re a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass verbally and physically a man who pretends to be gay to save his job then rent this and snack on a can of worms hideous 
poor quality i m not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot it s redundant and unnecessary and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that s based on and well my gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it s original format onto dvd was bad the soundtrack is about to second off from the video part of film therefore the voices don t sync up with the lip movement 
no sir didn t like it i m an animation fan and when this came up recommended to me i was eager to check it out while the animation was fine although a tad creepy i found the story off putting its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a ka substance d i found this film depressing and annoying i particularly found the blur suit to be distracting to watch it almost gave me a headache star did not like

emma peel where are you when we need you after viewing the avengers with emma peel which i do every evening after the dreadful news enjoying repeats and repeats as well with reluctance i played the hospital dvd i thought it was terrible the diagogue idiotic i could not help but laugh when scott attacked diana emma peel would have thrown him across the room i had to play a few episodes of emma peel in the avengers series to cleanse me of this disappointing and terrible hospital dvd the lovely diana rigg is a great actress and an extremely intelligent woman and i was saddened that diana after all those wonderful and exciting avengers collection with her unrivaled beauty and possessing the most beautiful voice and able to do her own stunts took on this dismal role in the hospital dvd i see that this dvd was dated this was only years after her last avenger episodes dated in hospital i believe she was years old oh well i will cleanse myself of this hospital dvd and devote an eveningr to a few episodes of the avengers with the lovely diana rigg as emma peel finall john steed would have been shocked to see how emma reacted to george scott the doctor can you imagdine if john steed appeared in the hospital dvd to collect diana rigg and ride off into the sunset as they do after an avenger episode perhaps they will issue hospital and bringr in john steed and a few other great actors of that series robert lyonsreno nevad 
strange movie very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it 
good production but absolutely pointless i should say first that this should be a good movie at least on paper john hurt and richard burton turn in solid performances and everything about the production set design costumes etc looks just as it should but there is something lacking in this adaptation that makes it pale compared to the book orwells nineteen eighty four was largely about reading and writing and the power they give to people as such it is a thrilling novel and a great pleasure to read seeing john hurt writing in winston smith s diary doesn t quite cut it for me the essential spirit is lost in the translation to film beyond this there are also some more mundane elements of the plot and characters that were cut to fit the screening time what i missed most was smith s growing frustration with julia being only a revolutionary from the waist down and his schoolboyish admiration affection really for o brienthe only real highlight of the movie is the constant voiceovers coming from the telescreens regarding the progress of the war and the rooting out of traitors orwell s vision is captured perfectly here and the woman who read the news voiceovers gets the tone exactly right all in all the movie is nowhere nearly as compelling as the book and isn t really worth the trouble in the time it takes you to procure and watch the movie you could be halfway through the book 
mumbles strikes again segall mumbles alot in this flick movie is disjointed and makes no sense characters are introduced that have no connection to the story segall stunt double is pretty good 
m night takes some suckers for a ride again in case you re wondering the aforementioned suckers are anybody who paid to see this movie and i dont mean just in a theater i count myself in because it cost me at my video store ! looking back i should have given that money to a homeless person then went home and stared at a wall while playing suspenseful music ! i would have gotten the same effect of watching this pretentious piece of garbage this guy sucks seriously his talent level should place him as a writer for the sci fi channel maybe he could write a few decent outer limits or twilight zone episodes but he is in over his head when it comes to big budget movies and where the f did the budget go has the the price of monster suits signs anyone increased to the multimillion dollar range my guess is he pocketed half of it and the other half went to the unwitting actors who s agents suckered them into this sham of a film if you read the quotes n trivia on amazon s link you will find that a kirsten dunst bailed out on this sinking ship good thinking girl and b sigourney weaver had nightmares after she read the script obviously she had already committed spoilershort summary of the incredibly unfeasible plot a bunch of people from the city who have had deaths in the family do the logical thing and go live in a wildlife preserve although we see no animals in it undetected by authorites long enough to raise children whom they traumatize into never leaving the village by dressing in monster suits and other scary tricks anyone ever seen a scooby doo episode then guy stabs another and they send a blind girl with guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately to go get medicine through the forbidden forest how she is supposed to acquire multiple stab wound effective medicine is up to her but the st guy she meets gets it for her no problem and helps her back over the wall into the park ! and the cult lives on seriouslythats the plot ive read that he stole this plot from the book running out of time not to mention the scooby doo thing or his camera style which he takes from hitchcock this guy is a hack folks 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
tedium notwithstanding the fact that the acing in the movie is actually quite good the screenplay is so tedious i actually fell asleep in the middle of the afternoon while watching it a good cure for insomnia 
disappointed this will only please the most ardent vampire fans why it s exceedinly poorly written i figured when i watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn t matter sadly it was neither don t get me wrong it was bad but in all of the wrong ways for example the writing plot dialog character development is basically not there well they are they re just about as interesting as chalk unfortunately the acting s not bad this results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie you can t laugh at the bad dialog because it isn t bad enough it s just flat and you can t laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it s acceptable it s got gore and blood but it isn t the least bit scary in general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of amityville horror to be released ryan reynolds may not play a vampire but that movie had more development in it s credits than this had in it s entirety 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
van gogh pure trash save your time and money it does not belong in the catagory with cezanne in provence 
a classics illustrated comic book would give you a better impression of tolstoy garbo is radiant but there is no other reason to watch this highly abridged telling of tolstoys novel while im used to hollywood by necessityt removing whole sections of a loooong book this is incomprehensible to anyone who hasnt some previous acquaintance with the story even the usually reliable fredric march and basil rathbone one of the greatest hams ever cant save it 
where s the maharishi when you need him i thought since this was a criterion collection flick that it was gonna be a psychedelic spaced out trip through india with heavy ravi shankar music incense and flower children with bells and long hair trying to find themselves it was about as far away from that as anyone could get but it was weird nonetheless basically it s the story of a bunch of rich white people living in india on some sort of plantation far from the everyday realities of india itself in their luxurious palace when i found out the plot i was immediately turned off because i hate movies about rich white people especially when they slum around in foreign countries ripping off the local economy through some sort of corporate pseudo slave labor arrangement sitting back on their plantations acting all sophisticated in white linen clothing so anyway the movie centers on this one white chick harriet and she is ugly good grief can she peel the paint off a wall anyhow she s living on this plantation with her ritzy family and her one very bizarre younger brother who likes to play with his lizard or something all of a sudden some rich white heart throb guy named captain john shows up and suddenly harriet gets it her first crush and she discovers something besides bad poetry and horses she first visits him while he is at her neighbor s house which strikes me as a weird sort of sexual harem because the neighbor s wife died and ever since then the neighbor apparently has the hots for a pre pubescent indian girl ah the elegance of foreign lands where there are no child exploitation laws anyway captain john is an american a sleazy bohemian type that looks like a cross between harry chapin and eraserhead he smokes cigarettes in a very sexual manner while galavanting around town in tommy bahama clothing harriet invites him to a party at their ritzy family house called the big house go figure and after she flirts with him non stop he decides to go for harriet s sister valerie who looks like an impish meryl streep with a bad nose job so jilted by captain john for her own sister harriet decides to stalk him all over the stereotypical indian village where we see all sorts of truly indian things like cobra charming and a marketplace where you can buy tapestries made by children enslaved in sweatshops all over india what i noticed at this point is that captain john looks about and harriet s like but even though he s fascinated with her in a quasi sexual way he plays hard toget in a sad development harriet says i have decided to conquer him and attempts to seduce him by reading her bad poetry which seems to amuse him like wow i ve got a year old rich white chick who thinks i m the man but the best part is that valerie who we ve come to totally despise for being the ego princess from hell steals harriet s diary and reads it aloud to captain john which of course contains bad love poetry about him so the two sisters get in an all out brawl right in front of this guy and he intervenes to cop a feel with both of them while breaking it up harriet then storms off which causes captain john to think valerie is a bitch for reading the diary so valerie then plays with him by throwing a toy at him which causes him to tear his hamstring and he limps off in a hilarious scene vowing never to hang out with her again at this point the movie turns really really strange suffice to say a third girl gets involved and good ol captain john starts spreading himself a little too thin keeping juvenile girls hanging as he tries to figure out which one to pop first however tragedy strikes as valerie harriet s brother the one with the lizard fetish gets a little too close to a pet cobra the sad outcome gives everyone a big wake upcall and everyone gets real moody the final outcome is an anti climactic scene where harriet resumes her poetry writing in a funk about failing to seduce a yearoldthis flick wouldn t be so bad if it weren t for the archaic screenplay atrocious acting even for and dull character development i mean it tries hard to be really indian but it s about as indian as a trip to the bombay company or pier most annoyingly the movie itself would be no more than a half hour in length if it weren t padded with very bizarre national geographic style narrations about indian culture complete with some british voice over chick that makes it seem like a rd grade social studies filmstrip at times i was waiting for the little beep to indicate where i needed to advance the frame the footage of india is swell in its weird early technicolor restored glory but after you get over that the whole package strikes me as really contrived i think of all the truly wonderful films that could stand the criterion treatment and it makes me wonder how they arrive at the decision to bother with crap like this 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
french garbage this review may sound pretentious and ignorant but in truth i m a big fan of british history so bear with me even as a film itself it s surreal and i don t like the acting but as with any historical film that includes the british they re made out to be the absolute bad guys ! sure we were forging an empire within france ie the hundred years war but rapists and murdering pillagers never historically accurate full of british sentiment and down right weird avoid this film today folks ! 
this is really misguided i have seldom seen such a bad movie with so much talent david arquette stephen baldwin mickey rourke etc one wonders what they saw in potential for this script or why they made choices to be involved this horribly misguided film centers around a juvenile prank gone awry that ends up involving two bank robbers who freak and there is enough gratuitous violence and mindless killing and torture to last me for the rest of my life the film starts out terribly boring and gets more mindless and boring as it concludes perhaps expecting the violence to make up for the total lack of story this is a disaster not worth enduring save the actors and film makers the embarrassment of seeing this film and see something else 
so awful i turned it off i saw this film on tv several years ago and started watching it because william hurt is one of my favorite actors i got as far as the monkey man scene and turned it off it was so ridiculous and just plain bad i can probably count on one hand the number of movies i have not watched all the way through i even suffer through the bad and boring ones i couldn t take another minute of this one however 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
in good company is not good company in good company goes on and on at the end a little bit and the ending especially is not fulfilling character plotwise if it had ended minutes before it actually did i would give it three stars instead of two i admit there were quite a few times when i laughed a bit to myself but it didn t make me fall off the couch or anything there were other times when i thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced overall it isn t an entirely bad movie but like i said the ending is unfulfilling overall not strong performances coming from scarlett johansson or topher grace 
hugely disappointed maybe it was just me but this concert dvd is a major disappointment ! it s quite surprising to see how little if any connection madonna makes with the audience shorn of her locks her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here perhaps it s a result of her having become larger than life ala striesand whitney houston etc despite all the razzle dazzle here examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound songs like vogue and express yourself should have been rousing stompers instead they are overstylized choreographed to the max and perfunctory the effect is like watching a canned tv award show performance worst of all is her ill conceived like a virgin i can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom but virgin recast as s marlene dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch complete with unisex tuxedo top hat and faux german accent this is a shocking lapse in judgment and boring to boot the only sign of life comes near the end with the lock step performance of holiday which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching band romp here she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi length military style coats ! one look at this performance and you can t help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff no one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for i m willing to give madonna one more shot and pick up the blond ambition dvd when or if it becomes available until then my best advice is to check out dvds featuring the likes of tina turner donna summer or even sade they all prove that you can make the old new again share and reveal something that a studio production can t and thus never need to worry about going stale real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp its audience connection ! 
really awful rankin bass needs to hire good singers this is the worst holiday movie in america ! i mean if you buy this product you ll face torture as in singing horribly making friends as the movie says is not the most important thing in the world in my belief they also said that if you want wish for fairy tales and it will come true right some fairy tales are gruesome for example this one fairy tale is so gruesome because it has fairies heads cut off eeww ! the voice talents are very annoying better save your money when you buy a christmas movie 
vaguely entertaining not sure what to make of the movie but it is definitely not one of the best movies and not sure if it is even a movie 
the snake man cometh okay the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful the only good thing going for this movie was the return of snake plissken this film s plot was essentially a rehash of the original escape from new york a bit more special effects which in fact did not make this a better movie when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character characters kurt russell s character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them obviously the movie doesn t really know where it s going as it takes two scenes minutes of the film st scene president commandant and lackey give snake the mission nd scene commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission to explan to the audience what s the basic conflict i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer carpenterrussell please don t tell me money caused you to revisit a cult figure some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson stacy keach steve buscemi and pam grier robertson keach and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters sorry snake i don t love l athebiggreenpointyearedone 
pretty cheesy big fan of nas but this moive s a bit over the top and have some good messages that suffer because of it visually flashy vacant plot and messages are reduced to sermonizing skip this and watch juice instead 
horrible movie this one is just plain awful it s a bunch of hollywood brats being histrionic 
to much bark not enough bite i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it i heard that it was the most violent film ever made i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better i was dead wrong cannibal ferox is a boring unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in countrys the few gore scenes are pretty effective but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws if it was for giovanni lombardo radice one of my favorite italian horror actors starring in it cannibal ferox would only earn star 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
uh no don t even think about it 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
a perfect film of gb shaw when one watches a george bernard shaw play one does not expect three dimensional characters with social roles and inner lives as the author puts it in a pompous forward to this film major barbara is a parable his capitals and the preaching never lets up the title character wendy hiller is the daughter of a millionaire arms manufacturer robert morley she is a zealous salvation army officer trying to convert the destitute of london with enthusiasm sympathy and a bribe of bread she is seen one afternoon in mid proselysation by adolphus cusins rex harrison an impoverished classics scholar who determines to marry her the stage is set for a typical shavian problem play you might subtitle the piece the soul of man under capitalism with the religious fanatic and the urbane industrialist doing battle for the souls of the english working and middle classes barbara is tested by drama undershaft fights back with mind numbing spectacle capitalism s genius is that it absorbs all opposition the loser is the audience barbara is one of shaw s less intolerable plays with the odd funny line all snatched by marie lohr as barbara s aristocratic mother peeping through the flat epigrams laborious dailogues and general sterile clever cleverness the wonderful cast hiller saintly and sexy in military uniform harrison hysterically smart red morley unflappably machiavellian and mephistophelean do what they can but they are playing ideas not characters and their attempts to blow life into cardboard only results in soggy paper it s never nice being aggressively lectured to and shaw s grinding dialectic becomes less agreeable on the big screen his use of old dramatic forms for non dramatic purposes stops everything dead although you can see how filming an ironic play about the armanents industry might have seemed radical during world war the works isn t improved by pascal s hapless filming what can he do his style as clunky and grey as shaw s sub wildean wit there are some major talents behind the scenes including david lean as editor and william walton as composer 
i love christmas movies but this one was both depressing and annoying from the back cover miracles do happen awardwinning actress mary steenburgen tvs joan of arcadia hope springs gives a solid performance as ginny grainger a young mother who rediscovers the joy and beauty of christmas thanks to the unshakeable faith of her six yearold daughter abbie elisabeth harnois and gideon harry dean stanton ginny s very own guardian angel ginny s wonderous experience will touch your heart and warm your soul in the timeless tradition of past disney favorites one magic christmas fulfills all your most treasured christmas fantasies share it with those you love and my review im such a sucker for christmas stuff i probably own more christmas books and movies than regular ones so this review is not from a bah humbug scrooge and i don t expect all of my christmas films to be happy happy joy joy all of the time my absolute favorite of all time is it s a wonderful life which can be very dark in places first off i don t think that the acting was bad in this movie and the cinematography was pretty good as well i made my judgment based on the content and the storyline which in my opinion flopped what i really found annoying was the way ginny the heroine was constantly being villified for example let me paint you a picture of her life her husband was laid off and hasn t worked in six months they have two young children she s making minimum wage and they re barely scraping by they ve also been evicted from their home since it s owned by her husband s previous employer and are forced to move in with her father inlaw they have very little saved in the bank and yet her husband wants to take out to buy christmas presents for the kids she understandably balks at the idea first of all is way too much to spend on presents for just two kids even if you re rich unless you want your kids to become spoiled ! remember this movie was originally made in so that number is even more outrageous plus they have only one meager paycheck to live on and no house of their own i think that she s being reasonable but she s painted as the bad guy for not blowing a bunch of their savings on toys then her husband wants to sink what little money they have into his own bike shop and possibly go into debt to own his own business again she s villified for being the only responsible one and telling her husband that he needs to get a steady job with a steady paycheck after all they may need their savings to survive this is not the time to be blowing it on dreams that may never pan out and usually don t since most small businesses fail in the first year but no she s shown to be a mean cold hearted witch for saying this grr it was just so irritating yes you want to give your kids a magical christmas yes the husband has always dreamed of owning his own shop but you have to be responsible especially when you have children to feed the clothe i don t think she was being a scrooge for wanting to be a responsible adult she did buy her kids resonably priced gifts after all but the film painted her as such and this film was so depressing it felt like the world was constantly kicking this family while it was down the happy ending was a long time in coming also i d be very hesitant to show this movie to impressionable young children i certainly wouldn t want one of my children to think that they can constantly disobey me run away from home in the middle of the night or talk to creepy looking strangers in trench coats that s how kids end up abducted or killed ! not really realistic i really expected better from disney especially when i really loved one of their other christmas movies the santa clause there are way better christmas movies out there see my list christmas movies that i watch every year for movies that are worth your time and money i don t recommend one magic christmas if you re still determined to watch it try to rent it first or you might find yourself upset that you wasted your money like i was 
does not do the book justice wuthering heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion betrayal madness despair greed hatred and revenge it s not necessarily a pleasant read but always an engrossing one emily bronte s characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you ve finished the book modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the bronte sisters works into film and this is no exception the characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book juliet binoche and ralph fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today but this movie is a definite low point for both as heathcliff and catherine fiennes and binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland binoche s personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role the other characters are likewise lacking in realism only janet mcteer fares well she is fabulous as ellen dean even if the acting were better the story does not capture the essence of the book everything moves too quickly the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words sinead o conners appearance as emily bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary this film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it the wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part ugly and unflattering fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice this isn t it 
bad enough to start race riots rhea perlman a short white woman is going to teach basketball to her towering black high school students and even though she knows nothing about hasketball she can still turn them into winners because she s white and sensitive and wants to be their quotsistahquot gag me this whole movie is completely insulting to people of all races the director seems so sure he can sell a hip hop basketball movie this bad to quotthose people quot that he doesn t even bother to hide his apparent distaste for them avoid at all costs 
disappointing i was expecting much more from this video it did have kids doing poses but it was hard to find the year old some of the circle games looked like they might be fun i wanted to show it to my third grade class but i don t think it would hold their interest all in all i felt i was watching someone s home video of their family doing yoga 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha

did they read the book while not one of his best novels tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time ! jimmy smits does his best but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble skip it 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
bad language i like sam elliott movies very much this one was bad a lot of bad language every couple of words it should be rated r i think instead of pg 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
did we see the same movie okay the script is not the most imaginative i ve ever seen but i like the actors especially ben s best man so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i didn t even mind the obvious holes in the plot such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones or at least why don t they use them oh no much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for to buy a car to drive to nc i didn t even mind the fact that the whole were married and my husband s a doctor charade was so predictable oh gee he s pretending to be a doctor and he s on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d ya think someone might have a heart attack and dr holmes might have to step up and uh they re pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there s the best man and maid of honor ! d ya think they re gonna get busted what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending it was obviously supposed to be a surprise and it was but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience i felt cheated i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah s little boy and all that i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they re not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen right up to the last moment we think he s breaking it off with bridget instead what the heck let s just go ahead and get married after all huh he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back this man obviously doesn t have a clue what he wants in life and i m expected to believe they lived happily ever after not only that but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us dont do it and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway it s just marriage it s romantic ! you could get lucky and live happily ever after its been my experience when things aren t feeling just right as you approach that wedding turn and run the last thing you should do is close your eyes grab your balls and take the leap 
historically accurate this movie is completely totally and sjamefully innacurate to what really happened i m from el salvador and as a boy a bomb exploded on my face got caught in the middle of gunfights and went to bed wondering if i would make it through the night as my fellow salvadorean said this movie makes the guerrillas loo like they were good people and our army as cruel reckless and bad first of all i witnessed a bus being hijacked by guerrillas and all the kids taken out to be recruited through my experience i can say that the guerrillas and the military did horrible things but this movie truly doenst show how the war was really like also i believe they try to make us look like a s town people on horse wagons and all the people are mexicanlike i know that to most of you this will come in as a surprize but people from el salvador as well as honduras nicaragua costa rica etc don t look like mexicans ! it makes me upset that we are stereotyped as mexicans well overall this is a historically innacurate bad movi 
an affair of love cedric kahn s lennui is the story of a middle aged man martin charles berling who has just gotten divorced and starts having an affair with a women half his age cecilla sophie guillemin at first the relationship is purely a sexual one he doesn t care for her and we suspect she doesn t care for him but soon martin realizes he may love her but she is a girl to love loved he thinks she is cheating on him and thus his world begins to crumble as he tries to catch her in the act other movies have dealt with similar ideas right now i m thinking of an affair of love which was about two people who answer an ad in the paper about meeting for a casual affair once a week soon the two fall in love but never confront their emotions the other movie is intimacy a story about two people who meet every wednesday for their affair but soon the man realizes he loves her but finds out she is married and tries to win her over both films worked lennui on the other hand doesn tmartin is a philosophy teacher and boy does he talk a lot ! i ve haven t becomed this annoying watching a character in a while the entire film consist of him questioning cecilla but i m jumping ahead let me explain cecilla was seeing a much older man a painter who was drawing nude pictures of her he died while making love to her and when martin finds out about this he is intrigued by her relationship with the man hence all the questions if only martin would shut up once in a while and actually listen to people maybe he wouldn t be in the state of mind he is even has he is making love he never stops questioning her and don t think cecilla is a treat either who is she what does she want does she love martin can she love anyone who knows and more importantly who cares we don t like either of these people i don t see how they can even stand each other out if i sat in room with martin i don t think i d last seconds with this guy what lennui needed to do was drop some of martin s dialogue give him more actions and tells us something about cecilla by the end of the picture we have a good sense of martin he s a pest and a loser cecilla though just seems heartless but is she really the movie was directed by cedric kahn who also directed the recent red light a much better film kahn is interested in human relations he likes to put his characters in intense situations and just watch them explode that sounds fine but you have to give us something to care about i never cared for these people i never understood them some people may watch the film because they find it erotic one can t really comment on that because different people find different things erotic i didn t think it was but who knows bottomline do you feel like watching two annoying people for two hours this is your movie 
horrid i went into this movie not expecting anything special i had read the reviews and got a mixed feeling i decided to go for it i wish i hadn t i couldn t even finish watching the movie it was so bad characters popping out of nowhere and having no purpose almost each and every scene could be given an award as worst scene in any movie if that award was given i had read that some of the scenes were beautiful all right i suppose the scenery perhaps but the acting was awful even if i like an actor i try not to be bias and colin farrell and salma hayek are not bad actors if i remember correctly this was laughable sutherland s role had no purpose it was well acted but it meant nothing the story didn t work it just didn t flow well i felt almost tipped while watching it because everything was off no one is seriously offended and then swoons over the one who did the offending not in a matter of a few seconds anyway the story moved so fast and was so crooked that i called it quits before i squirmed through anymore of the razzie worthy scenes 
big rig big mistake big shark the worlds biggest and safest oil rig is ready to drill on unstable ocean floor in the arctic bad move in a scene from deep star six the drilling opens up a huge cavern that is teeming with life that has gone extinct elsewhere million years ago one life form is a megalodon which leaves the rich feeding ground of the cave for the more barren waters of the arctic would you like a bridge with that actually the first shark evidence a shadow does not appear until minutes into the movie the rig and the small cast are now at risk from a powerful predator mistakes abound in this film in unexpected ways i am used to these film getting the extinction dates wrong but this one got it right however it does play heck with a lot of other details imagine a body at feet down that does not suffer from the pressure imagine and elevator and subs that travel the feet from surface to ocean floor in a matter of minutes imagine a shark that has no internal organs it is solid like a statue imagine planning rescue boats that have to be dropped bow first sixty feet to the water and have wounded aboard watch visitors get invited to a dinner with no food and everyone leaves at the start the disk is very barren just play movie and a chapter selection no trailers commentary behind the scenes although it is credited in the credits no nothing

will carrie wind up with zhivago or stalin oops i must be mixing up my stories an insufferable view of life among a claque of ruskie girlfriends from the late s to the late s nothing more than sex the city transplanted to moscow in the khruschev and brezhnev eras if thats your cup of borscht more power to you 
visually stunning i waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad i read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie the only way i can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of thomas kinkade is so popular it is so marketed and fake served to you as great art that is exactly how this movie has been served to you don t accept it find something real 
interesting but terribly one sided as a frequent visitor to the himalayas and being closely in touch with both tibetans ordinary folks not the tortured ones and the chinese i find this documentary interesting but terribly one sided i have not met a single wealthy tibetan in nepal or india who can swear to me that he will return to a freed tibet run by their government in exile to be fair to the experts a lot of the evidence of chinese violence against the tibetans is real i sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated however the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of chinese aggression while it is true that many tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries were there no looters vandals infighting if you had ever witnessed these riots would you think that more people might have been hurt or killed had the soldiers not opened fire its also incredibly naive to assume that all tibetans think the same even dharamsala the seat of the tibetan government in exile is not without opposition violence and even assasination while i do think that most tibetans are good buddhists and nice people the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the chinese and everything saintly with the tibetans this is something i find totally unacceptable a few snapshots of tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing the documentary seems only able to find tibetans who are against chinese rule they paint the picture that nobody in tibet is happy this is patently untrue but then this sort of thing sells in america you have to have a demon you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero america in this case otherwise it just won t sell it s not about compassion at all if you really want to be illuminated visit tibet and tibetan communities all over china and see things for yourself that would be far more enlightening sadly many journalists prefer to interview the wrong right people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent 
disappointment i was expecting it to be scary richly textured and ambient however the low budget quality of the film creates many boundaries something as simple as the lack of makeup on any of the actors is distracting this movie is not compelling and is not scary the story is predictable this is not a movie you think about after you watch it i would recommend this only to those who love the genre 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
nice idea but too slow to be enjoyable i wonder if bad subtitles ruined the film but it was so painfully slow i found it impossible to sit through i wonder if it picked up but i couldn t tolerate it it s also unbelievable past the normal suspension of disbelief ok there s one guy with deep thoughts but everyone else has deep thoughts and or is a maniac can t anyone have a blank mind like homer simpson 
hollow terrible one good line quoted here the characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting an effort to watch make up dyed hair costumes poorly done one man s eyebrows the suitor s are altered like a woman s no scenery or homes of interest except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor not a pleasant pace without humor without intrigue a lesbian undertone in one scene the only positive thing i can think of is this good line of jane austen quoted fanny sums up in one sentence why she will not marry him women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty will wish to sum up their certainty with ms austen s line his sole interest is in being loved not in loving this line is an exception to a lifeless script there now you do not need to endure the painful movie here are two lines re written by me for the woman dealing with a trifling man no man suffers pains of love on the stage for dealing with the infatuated man you have wounded yourself but not with love this movie should be re made by someone sharing the ideals of jane austen there is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film humorous with singing with interest a movie can take the best of the book in the spirit of the book which this movie did not carry and make a movie better than the book this movie is bad any which way wellmade period romance films are pride prejudice wives daughters north south fairly made is under the greenwood tree i rated persuasion at stars for the wooden acting however persuasion is stars compared to this mansfield park persuasion has attractive scenery costumes beautiful singing and an uplifting plot though of interest only to women preferably who have already read the book 
a dog this movie is a dog pure and simple we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought they can t sell it so they re giving them away hide fast 
youre going down burnhead i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i cannot compare the character to other sources therefore coming from someone that did not know darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment there are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies like the shadow batman etc which is interesting nevertheless darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make up of the cast liam neeson larry drake and frances mcdormand among others it is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement in an effort to exact revenge he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets victimsin short the acting and the plot are average nothing great while the dialogues are way below average the movie falls into the action adventurehorror type of category the characters are overall bland and just plain uninteresting eg rick anderson played by the fool ted raimi from the xena series though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really in a nutshell it s not a movie you would want to add to your collection but it might provide for an evening s entertainment and that s about it no masterpiece here stars 
better the nd time around with judicious use of the ff i came to this film with the attitude of enjoying a bit of ridiculous camp emma thompson and alan rickman sporting nawlins accents i couldn t pass that up well even with the right attitude coming in it was at times painful emma s dialect coach should have been shot alan did better at least he sounded like he was aiming at a southern accent but he tends to drawl a bit anyhow so maybe it was easier for him however emma and alan are only supporting characters the main characters are not terrible or anything but really not that compelling oh the plot the film does have a good plot and it could have been interesting but nonetheless i found it a bit plodding and as others have noted the editting is so weak it s comical oh actually there is a quite memorable scene the cunnilingus scene in a meat locker wow that was umunusualwell emma and alan fans will no doubt watch it but save it for a slow mid week night actually any emma fans with a sense of humor should definitely watch this at some point emma is obviously having a good time and seeing her dangle a cigarette while tailing on roller blades is something else it just you might not want to choose this as a film to watch with friends unless you want to expose the depths to which you will descend to watch emma or alan on the screen addendum alan plays a good character here it s a nice lite break if you ve been working through his films where he often plays morally ambiguous or not so ambiguous characters in films that explore difficult themes 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
stick with import why american production make hk movies look so cheap first of all they cut off so much scene second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by english dubb for any of hk movies always stick with original licensed hk release be careful with cheap imports boots though 
aghghhhhh this is awful this has got to be one of the worst films i ve ever seen the characters are pointless and one dimensional the guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy they have sudden fights over apparently nothing in fact there is no cause andeffect in this movie at all ! things just happen randomly for no apparent reason there s no real story the takes are boring most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing the violent ending wasn t even believable ! instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy i was left just thinking what the really really pointless all around 
senseless and absurd sorry can t finish this garbage movie is this girl retarded or what watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all how and why the garbage collecting turned cow feeder young guy would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer there s no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath the girl didn t look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless what life was too boring then what started becoming natural born killer give me a break bone chilling you can always say that again but won t make me care a bit more 
the cover and the title make you think you re in for more than this movie delivers as fans of starship troopers know the very name starship troopers implies a galaxy sweeping epic with lots of violence gore heroism humor drama and tons of big budget special effects this one is limited to one location his lots of gore but little in the humor drama and big budget special effects department one has to wonder at the thought processes in hollywood starship troopers was a big success sure it was expensive but it is also a regular staple on cable tv and it continues to sell well or so on amazon in dvd sells as of today which isn t bad for a year old movie one would think that a starship troopers would have been in the works for a long time perhaps a final push to the bug home system instead according to the director s commentary track the special effects director of the original starship troopers came up with this simple low budget plot that he wanted to direct somehow sold it to the powers thatbe at sony and they backed it provided that he slash his already bare bones budget even more so what do you get when you give starship troopers a budget that is only yes five percent the size of the original movie a bad movie full of special effects tricks that you are most likely to see in s sci fi cult classics the movie s premise changes from being a war epic to being a haunted castle movie a premise that the producers and director freely admit to on the director s track they also admit to it being a b movie and that it was intentionally filmed to go straight to dvd some reviewers have made comments about it being a poorly lit movie that was also intentional poor lighting means that the movie s special effects can be of lesser quality unfortunately one of tippett s other compensations for a low budget is to add more blood to every scene in the last half of the movie it gets silly after a while rather than dramatic the movie is derivative of several other movies and tv shows including star trek tng remember the plot that picard uncovered in which aliens were physically inserting themselves into the brains of high ranking members of star fleet well i hate to write a spoiler but xfiles same as a abovealiens there s a scene that just steals from the one in which the paul reiser character drops an alien into ripley s sleeping quarters alien the dark sets with a creepy monster about john carpenter s the thing the premise of being an outpost cut off from the rest of humanity while an alien takes people over one by one the scene where the general is chased into the base steals from the one in which the dog in the thing is chased to the antarctic research lab by the helicopter brenda strong comes to this movie as a familiar face but not as the same character her character in the original troopers was a fleet captain who died a horrible death in this one she is an army sergeant no one is quite sure why they felt the need to have a face from the first mivie but she does a good job and on the director s track they credit her with making this movie shoot a positive experience on a lot of levels that makes it all the more bizarre that her name is not listed on the cover of the dvd or on the back cover credits too bad her character was just about the closest thing that i found to believable in the whole movie i give this two stars rather than one because i found the director sproducers track to be quite fascinating maybe it should only be watched with that track playing i give this one a d it fails to deliver on the promise of the original in so many ways 
disappointing i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline well they needn t have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday i liked both of the main actors jessica lange and ed harris the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok

you ll never get rich this is not one of fred s better efforts the dancing is so so and rita hayworth is among his poorest dance partners lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the astaire rogers films in spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching

an exercise in film making not a film roman polanski whom i m none too big a fan is quoted as saying people like truffaut lelouch and godard are like little kids playing at being revolutionaries and i think that quote sums up shoot the piano player fairly well it s an exercise in film using new ideas concepts such as the scene where we don t follow charlie but instead follow the woman leaving the apartment room but in the end is a vapid hollow piece of art like a norman rockwell painting or the work of andy warhol upon initial release the film was torn apart by the general public critics alike but now some years later it s considered a landmark film one of the most if not the most important of the french new wave a movement cited as being the biggest influence on the american cinema of the late s and early s but simply because it was influential doesn t necessarily stamp it s place as flawless everything about the film is fantastic the acting the music the cinematography and yes the radical ideas truffaut used are inspiring but it s not enough to save a film that is utterly meaningless the thing about the french new wave s effect of american cinema is that american film makers took their ideas added a layer of depth to them they were more than just oh let s try this weird shot it ll be experimental the movement on numerous occasions has been compared to jazz which i can understand but don t agree with with jazz yes there s a free flowing improvisation but there s something there than just pretty pictures ideas that would be considered absurd by the standard audience s mind a fantastic example of a scenario where the influence was greater than the original is john cassavettes whose killing of a chinese bookie has the feel of a french new wave film but is also a fantastic work of art 
worthless except for tarantino s cameo sleep with me would be completely worthless if not for a quentin tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of top gun that lasts about two minutes the remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious ersatz neo bohemian characters except for tarantino s top gun bit and the twenty seconds or so when parker posey has her shirt off there s nothing worthwhile here 
almost but not quite as a fan of the coen brothers i was very disappointed by this film because it was almost good the snappy and perfectly timed dialogue they usually have never quite materializes here the wonderful characters you would expect to find here are mostly hollow and not quite original or sharp add to this the fact that the original is a classic and in no way needed to be remade and it s a swing and a miss this movie seems less like a coen brothers movie than it does a movie made by fans of theirs that were stealing from them in uninspired ways 
van gogh pure trash save your time and money it does not belong in the catagory with cezanne in provence 
a big dud avoid this one like the plague women inprison films are supposed to be erotic ! that means they re supposed to have at least one of the three following things and preferably more than one an evil lesbian warden who enjoys the bodies of her pretty prisoner playthings turning at least one of them into her beautiful nude sex slave evil lesbian guards who occasionally strip the girls naked before whipping spanking them and later take them into their own quarters for their private pleasures especially late at night tough lesbian inmates who prey on the younger most beautiful newcomers often in the shower but also in their beds at night well this particular video has none of these things ! there are no lesbians in this prison ! there are only gay male guards and a boring old man as the warden the women are certainly pretty enough and their outfits revealing enough but as a women inprison flick this one sucks it s not erotic not recommended 
ponderous welcome to bucharest where zachary david gunn the vampire killer has come to hunt the creatures that turned the woman he loved into a monster he had no choice but kill this time his objective is ash jonathan morris a master vampire who maintains his tribe in the secret bucharest underground while operating a very high toned nightclub as a lure for new blood what zachary doesn t count on is his attraction for sofia kirsten cerre a beautiful american pianist who has come to bucharest to perform and who has become the object of ash s desires not only must ash deal with zachary s attempts to destroy his nest and reclaim sofia he has political problems among his own vampire servants welcome to a film where everyone speaks as if they used to have a romanian accents and only saw the scripts a week ago the is a kind of heavy handed lack of emotionality about this film as vampires announce their intent to destroy each other with almost no inflection in their voices while this is a pretty film to watch with lots of midnight scenes of bucharest the moodiness of the cinematography and the score are not matched by the acting obligatory scenes with fake blood and frontal nudity give the work a sense of awkwardness that director ted nicolaou never quite manages to overcome 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
whip gun and typewriter having read all these reviews presently on line it was not hard to find a fair number with which i can agree that this is an abysmal film even despite the surprisingly impressive physical production values in the attention to detail that was taken to recreate the physical appearance of the death camp at auschwitz birkenau too bad a director with a script telling the truth about the place wasn t there on the set with film and crew to take advantage of it many an astutely observed fault has come to be mentioned in a good number of these reviews as per the really tacky concept of the screenplay itself the almost adolescent quality to the writer directors touch the lack of content in dialogue the resulting shallowness of characterization for the actors roles all of that was well observed and yet what amounts to the worst fault of all remains without mention the one thing i had hoped to find which would have obviated any necessity of adding one more regrettably lengthy review to a long list of them okay so am i the only one among the whole lot of us here who comes into it sickened by the violent vandalism that has been wreaked upon the historical record of the actual event by this writer director artistic license is one thing but willful distortion of the public knowledge to a purpose of questionable motivation is quite another if a viewer of this film is familiar with only so much as what can be learned about the revolt of october from the official website of the auschwitz museum at auschwitz see the article resistance movement at kl auschwitz berkenau a pdf file then one fundamental fact will be known that the only non jewish poles who were in any way associated with the sonderkommando were there exclusively in the capacity of kapos not as crematorium workers they were the head bashing s s appointed guards often imported from polish prisons whose duties consisted strictly in serving as foreman and cop to keep the death machine running smoothly and well greased on the blood of jewish worker and jewish victim alike well might one inquire into exactly what is being served by tim blake nelson s intent of assigning every sympathetic role in his script to either a gentile pole or the nazi ss oberscharfuhrer keitel who has to stay drunk to do what the jews are doing comparatively sober so you have these purely mythical gentile polish workers of the sonderkommando who are by far moral superiors to the jews typified by the buscemi character who soon reveal themselves to be everything that the keitel character in his jew hatred only lately gained has to say of them and what had this ss oberscharfuhrer eric muhsfeldt to say but such things as would be based on strict observation since having seen now how low a jew can really go doing to their fellow jews what they would so totally not want done unto them yet what the harvey keitel character doesn t observe and what tim blake allen s script does not observe is that these jews under his whip and gun andor typewriter are doing only the same as this oberscharfuhrer is doing under nowhere near the force of coercion not to the jews alone but as the ss enforcement arm of the gestapo to any decent or dissident german to the whole world as a cog in the wheel of the greater reich s death machine and so the keitel character fancies himself to be shocked to learn that jews just like any german such as himself can knuckle under and bow tremble in fear under the marching boots of tyranny to the surrender of every shred of human decency for sake of howling sieg heil safely going with the flow of society how shocked he pretends himself to be to discover that jews are no better than he that given the worst of circumstances they like he should become killers money grubbing wheeler dealers showing themselves to be by turns brutal or calculating murderers traitors to their own kind but this is not alas what is to be gleaned from the script of tim blake nelson s filthy little movie quite to the contrary if a person is not aware of what actually did occur historically as from a book like filip muller s eyewitness auschwitz three years in the gas chambers then you well might wind up pinning five amazon stars on the guy with the thought well implanted most subliminally in mind that ss oberscharfuhrer eric muhsfeldt didn t really have it all so wrong after all its not hard to be tricked see the fathers and mothers brothers and sisters of mozart goethe and schiller circa 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
a disturbance it was made if a suspense filmed was played in the woods and it didn t actually contain any suspense would a bear watch it the previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making domestic disturbance the newest thriller starring john travolta vince vaughn and teri polo lets talk for a few minutes about mr travolta can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them i think that travolta has now surpassed richard dreyfuss as the comeback lose it again king after a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer quentin tarantino in pulp fiction travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices faceoff and broken arrow highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed travolta to join the million club in the last few years every film travolta has appeared in has failed miserably lucky numbers the general s daughter that film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it swordfish interesting but a flop battlefield earth why does he keep making this trash it has to be the paychecks i can t see any other conceivable reason john baby how long before the studios realize that these films aren t making any money and they stop hiring you john baby how long before you need another comeback vehicle frank morrison john travolta is a divorced father who makes wooden boats he doesn t get a lot of business but the business that he does get gets a great deal he doesn t charge his customers enough to make a profit frank does this because he is the good guy his son danny matthew o leary has a lot of problems accepting his mom s teri polo new relationship with rick barnes vince vaughn he gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone a couple of days after his mom and rick get married he stows away in rick s car and witnesses him murdering a business associate the police don t believe him however after a little soul searching frank believes his son he may lie to everyone but he doesn t lie to frank directed by harold becker sea of love domestic disturbance is a suspense film without any suspense from the moment danny stows away in rick s car and watches him murder ray steve buscemi which we also watch we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is to make matters worse frank instantly believes his son which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between frank and rick a boring cat and mouse game when you know the identity of the villain a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet when frank believes danny early on the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it the film would ve been greatly improved by showing danny in the backseat of the car watching everything the pain and suspense registering on his face while the audience sees nothing then when danny tries to convince his dad the police chief his mom that rick is a murderer at least we haven t seen the act and we would require some convincing as well because the filmmakers chose to show us everything the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have frank doubt danny his son however after a very brief segment frank believes danny causing us to watch a battle between frank and rick which isn t very interesting each of the actors including travolta are serviceable in their roles but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium skip domestic disturbance it isn t even worthy of a video rental go to see the far superior and very different amelie or the man who wasn t there your money will be much better spent

he doesn t lie to me domestic disturbance is a typical hollywood film the story characters and even the camerawork all seem prefabricated and recycled the language that travolta and vaughn spurt from their mouths even feels repetitive do you know why because we have seen it all before this film did not scare me did not entice me or even excite me in anyway because of the resemblance this had to every other film of this genre it is the classic story of the boy that cried wolf too many times and eventually everyone never believed him it is the classic story of the strength of a father that believes that when life throws lemons that he must make lemonade it is the classic story of the family struggle to survive against all odds it is nothing fresh it is nothing new it is nothing remarkable it is hollywood in its purest form audiences paid money to see this recycled film and for that i think we should all be issued an apology from the hollywood community i even have the subtle feeling that everyone involved in this project felt the same way travolta and vaughn are laughable in their roles the child actor was acting and you could tell every time he was on screen the only fun character in this entire production was steve buscemi who continually plays this slippery sneaky fishy looking character that just gets under your skin the wrong way he was perfect i only wish i could say the same for everyone else perhaps it is my newer images of vaughn that hurt him in this role after seeing the comedy duds like dodgeball and starsky hutch i couldn t help but think that vaughn was trying to play a bit of comedy into this role as well he just didn t seem to fit his eyes needed to see evil when in fact they saw nothing more than the cue cards reminding him of his lines i kept waiting to hear him say something to travolta about vegas baby vegas but alas it never occurred i felt similar about travolta s role in this film his character suffered from lack of solidity i never felt that he was a strong father i knew he could build boats but fight evil i just couldn t see it i also had trouble seeing the father son dynamic during the scenes that him and o leary share i continually felt that they were acting their parts not building the characters it was sad and only left me with a weak impression of them when the climax occurred teri polo was shallow really contributing nothing to the story other than the classic role of mother who will not believe while child actor matt o leary definatly needed more time with an acting coach before landing this role all of these paid actors were going through their parts but not into their characters which ultimately flawed the film what happens when you have actors not reaching their potential and a story that seems like it could be a madefortvmovie you get the film domestic disturbance the story was horrible father who loves his son who cannot let go of a previous life although it seemed that in the film travolta and polo were ok with there divorce who doesn t trust his ex wifes new beau this seemed like a very troubled man instead of the hero that he portrayed i also felt that this story really didn t give any credit to the local police instead of investigating it seemed like they were just sitting around that was travolta s tax dollars at work but instead he ended up doing all the work it reminded me of the times that i have to bag my own groceries at the story am i not paying for the goods so that they can provide baggers ah well from the opening scene of this film until the unclimactic ending which made me chuckle due to the lack of sympathy it was nothing more than hollywood fluff travolta had been making a strong return to the film industry prior to this project and i wish that somebody had talked him out of it this film was filler and plenty of people got paid for some shoddy workmanship overall i was very disappointed with this film in fact i was more than disappointed i was appalled this had no redeeming value to it outside of buscemi and it continually perplexed me as to why it was made there was no stretching of anyone s acting ability nor did i ever really see the power family structure that was so important to the characters what i saw was an angry father upset about the path his life has taken and decides to do something about it using his son s lies as a crutch perhaps i needed vaughn s character to be darker or maybe more boats built to help me understand travolta s role but something needed to happen and it didn t this was a sad excuse of a film and i do not recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the cinema grade out of 
wow it s impressive how much of a mess this is the weight of water kathryn bigelow this movie should have been a big production an adaptation of an anita shreve novel directed by near dark s kathryn bigelow starring a handful of big name actors so why does it seem like a lifetime original movie tm on steroids jean janes shadow of the vampire s catherine mccormack is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the isles of shoals in when louis wagner romes ciaran hinds was convicted of the murders of two women and executed jean isn t sure they got the right person she and her poet husband thomas sean penn set off for the islands on a boat with thomas brother rich josh lucas recently of poseidon and rich s new girlfriend adaline elizabeth hurley who went from this right on to film bedazzled the interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else and the situation on the boat brings jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime its an interesting premise and from everything i ve heard it s carried off quite successfully in the book which i haven t read but oh it doesn t work well at all in the film the links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way most of the actors are wasted here even the vastly talented mccormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self while sarah polley whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame seems as if she s worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life about the only actor who s really effective here is hinds who plays his role to the hilt its not the worst movie i ve seen in the past month but it s pretty close 
not what i was looking for this movie concentrates on cobb as a bitter old drunk desperately trying to get his life story told from his point of view i expected to see more scenes from when he was playing ball but sadly there is really only one scene that showed his legendary hitting and baserunning and that scene is very short and quite poor if you are interested in what cobb was like as an old angry man go for it if you are interested in cobb as the greatest offensive ballplayer ever skip this one in a hurry other than that i thought the movie on its own merits as a movie was pretty lousy i regret buying it 
how does such a whiney little brat become darth vader after seeing the travesty that was episode one in the theatre i decided to give this one a try assuming that it couldn t possibly get any worse was i right oh man i was worse than right i was wrong the weak character development that took place with anakin skywalker in no way led me to believe that this person could eventually become darth vader the character anakin is such an undisciplined whiney little brat that it becomes utterly unbelievable that this kid could become a dreaded supervillian on top of that the chemistry between him and padame was very weak the supposed romance between them was devastated by mediocre acting and no real interesting dialogue so once again the special effects department has broken their backs carrying this movie without a strong plotline or interesting characters this movie becomes not a story but just an impressive light show it seems as if george lucas figured that if the technology that he has now is light years ahead of what he had twenty five years ago then the audience won t need anything else the special effects in the three prequel movies was so inconsistent with the older films that they should have been released as a completely different story alltogether and finally we get to yoda a puppet that can bounce around and defy gravity with a lightsaber but still needs a cane to walk in the older films empire strikes back for example yoda was balancing on luke s feet during his handstand when luke lost his balance and fell over wouldn t yoda be able to just use the force and gently float to the ground instead of tumbling to the ground out of control with him is that because of lack of special effects technology back then or just yoda was getting too old to use the force anymore just a little food for thought i ll let you decide so once again the only plus in this film is the impressive visual effects if your expecting more however then george lucas will once again let you down 
risky material for its time horrid entertainment for the si read mixed reviews for this flick but i bought the dvd out of admiration for billy wilder and a respect for the humor that dean martin generally lends to a role oh man was that ever a mistake before i get into the part about this being the worst movie i ve ever seen my family was in the theater business when i was a kid and i asked my dad why i d never heard of this flick before all he said was it was banned too controversial for the time well i should have listened to him by controversial i thought maybe he meant that this wilder film was ahead of its time avant garde sort of stuff and like that haw haw haw but what he was actually talking about was the theme of marital infidelity that is at the core of the script ok well other comedies of the s s addressed the issue of infidelity too but as far as i know only another wilder project the apartment actually provided a vehicle where anybody was successful at it ! but thats not why this movie is so bad and i m no angel but a premise where a vegas singer shows up at your house and expects to hose down your wife during his stay just because he s there is sort of disquieting ok that pisses me off alright but the real a number reason this movie sucks sooooooo bad is ray walston now mr walston was a fine character actor and had some theatre to his credit but he is the central character of this flick and as such he occupies the camera too much he s annoying he s irritating he only has one speed frantic and he aint that easy to look at for hours at a time and if he wasnt bad enough kim novak shows up with a cold a brooklyn accent and at least extra pounds which i suppose is what hookers in nevada were supposed to look like before hbo somebody with a little star power like a jack lemmon could have saved this turkey but if all that wasnt bad enough this thing was actually produced in black and white yes its and they are still making movies in b w that surprised even me you ve been warned poached eg 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
unforgettable unfortunately this movie survives in my memory for over years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one rare or better than this one as an example buffalo is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die 
fading fading gone this movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books ethan hawke leans to heavily on kris kristofferson s performances not to mention jeff tweedy s music as a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music it is written interestingly enough but the visuals look like there wasn t enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on the best way to watch this movie is in the background you don t need the visuals and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away 
pretty woman meets toxic tort even though i would agree that erin brockovich is an entertaining movie julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath story but this movie has such shaky roots in reality it is more of a tall tale than the true story of a historic class action suit that i would imagine left more unhappy plaintiffs than it did satisfied ones however as the movie title implies this is indeed erin brockovich s story in the same way that the xena character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess though it should be noted that xena s wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character erin brockovich is a vain brassy boorish single mother of three young children with no marketable work skills a transparently opportunistic manner who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in pretty woman prior to richard gere s character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree the movie s beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident her lawsuit is lost primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony swearing cursing and shrieking from the witness stand while being questioned by opposing counsel unbelievably erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney s played by albert finney firm mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk later while handling the paperwork for a run ofthemill pro bono real estate sale erin discovers the file contains the seller s medical records that for reasons she correctly does not understand seem to be of particular interest to the buyer the mega utility company pacific gas and electric erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg e had for decades negligently contaminated the ground water surrounding one of their power plants in near hinkley ca on the edge of the mojave desert with toxic hexavalent chromium this discovery leads to the queen mother of all class action lawsuits at least in terms of the award in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg e by and through the representation of erin s boss in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs roberts gives a photogenic if not especially gifted performance in her role as erin the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts literally gushing out skin tight low cut bustier inspired work clothes that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents while there is much to be said for erin s apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit she is not an especially likeable character rather she is rude verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry the aged and weary attorney who is erin s boss the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy five inchedheeled mules than on the sometimes interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters aaron eckhart plays the affable gentle biker and next doorneighbor george who becomes erin s boyfriend byconvenience the convenience factor is totally one sided and for erin s benefit exclusively she unabashedly uses george for free live in childcare thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar bonus check from masry when the tort action case settles contrastingly george gets a thanks for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed make no mistake this movie is about erin brockovich indeed i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present and less about the brave struggles with life threatening generation spanning illnesses that the real life plaintiffs were forced to face due to the toxicity in their water source erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience in typical hollywood fashion as a sort of heroine but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich is the movie entertaining absolutely inspiring not even slightly 
pheelyp es a weeynie this is a ho hum buddy picture about a bunch of guys driving aimlessly around the west for one last fandango before they get drafted most of their time is spent ragging on one guy pheelyp to the point where one wonders why he is friends with the other three the peril of vietnam hangs in the background while these dopes carry on with their fake texas accents passable popcorn fun if you ve got nothing better to do 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
pure garbage i hate this movie ! because it protrays yearold girls in such a negative light i m almost years old and i felt disgusted that adults think that all teenagers do is smoke and do drugs and drink when they really don tin real life teenage girls don t do that kind of stuff i think hollywood producers should make movies about girls following their dreams and finding themselves rather than they do drugs and overdose and die it s so disgusting that the media presents teenagers like this to the public and then adults think that s what young girls are like i don t think i have ever seen a movie about a seventeen yearold girl like this ever it s the worst movie i ve ever seen in my whole entire life and i shouldn t have seen it to begin with i m sorry i wasted my time watching this piece of crap i love sandra bullock i think she s a cool woman and an great actress but this piece of trash is too horrible for words it s sick ! don t watch this at all 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
bad this movie is just plain bad it never should have been released for public consumption i honestly cannot think of one good thing to say about this movie it makes no sense that it would have stars with reviews something fishy is going on here enough time wasted on this one 
lol if you want uncut original version always look for original licensed production not us release its a foreign film it should not be us version to begin with hello why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie s fighting scenes and us release ruins the speed and sound as well i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable and higher in quality american market always like to americanize and control regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way rest of the world enjoys it no one makes hollywood american movies to french version or chinese version this what americans are doing well enjoy the cheap american version then lo 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
great acting but unbelievable story line this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting especially the girls playing christy and ariel is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but couldn t he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but can t find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i can t imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter s eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed 
style over substance director steve kloves manages to make texas look both gorgeous and desolate thomas newman s score is haunting and evocative dennis quaid james caan meg ryan and gwyneth paltrow offer complex fleshed out performances what destroys the film in my opinion is its listless pandering its inability to focus on the truth of the issues and its ambiguous and unfulfilled ending flesh and bone also pulls a big coincidence that manages to be both improbable and unbelievable kloves twist is predictable from the moment meg ryan appears on the screen and the inevitable confrontation between quaid and caan is also telegraphed a mile away in spite of its good performances and atmospheric direction flesh and bones is empty and pointless 
i am so angry i was livid when i saw this movie after reading the book it is barely on course with the book they could have done a much better job with that story what a waste of good actors like denzel and salli richardson 
quack quack the hospital as well crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience it is not so much a dark comedy but a mean spirited one i was a fan of paddy chayefsky s network and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness i m led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole if george c scotts character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he s not brooding drinking or contemplating suicide he s off on some rant diana rigg is completely wasted in this film her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini skirt and be ravaged by scott s character the film is also not helped by the lead footed direction of arthur hiller the medical profession can be lampooned but don t look for it in this uneven tirade of a film 
not so much a horror movie per say this movie is more dark comedy and trippy foreign bizarrovision film than dyed inthewool zombie fest if you were like me who isn t well versed in the foreign horror movie scene this movie was entertaining but not what i d consider something i d add to the library thanks netflix one thing i ve found with italian horror movies they spend alot of effort on visual trippery seems they want every italian movie to be an art film and this is no exception same goes for the argento films of the past its not a bad thing just a distinctive style that you either buy into or you do not an awful lot of strange things happen for no real apparrant reason a little bit of sex again in that erotic italian artsy style a bumbling mentally retarded sidekick and a whole lot of strange implausable things happening and then eventually the movie ends the story is definately more love story dark comedy its entertaining has a few minutes of zombie suspense but its almost wrong to call this a horror film because its really not 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download 
great play but look at the editing into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites having seen the pbs presentation of this i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close ups this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play the staging by forcing the viewer s perspective this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath i am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director s vision 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
poor hd dvd i own both blu ray and hd dvd movies and have been consistently dissapointed with all the hd dvds they just don t compare to blu ray the hulk was not a very good movie to begin with and the transer to hd dvd was not impressive picture quality was average at best and the sound quality was also mediocre i have yet to find any hd dvd that is even comparable to the best of blu ray 
philadelphia denzel washington is probably my favorite actor even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate he shone tom hanks well lemme quit hating the guy this is a well intentioned movie tom did a creditable job and we had extreme close ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy a passionate one though since he s still a latino after all actually this is a hollywood message movie and you know what that means it s about as subtle as michael moore those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie those who don t agree with the message stay as far away from it as possible theres a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy the way they stared at him reminded me of lao wei in china experiences denzel s character was reminded of segregation even though he s too young to remember it and started to care about tom hanks character aids discrimination is bad actually any discrimination at all is bad and that s the movie s message i agree with the message but still that s all we ve got as a totally irrelevant non sequiter if the name sam francisco means anything to you you ve seen subtle commentary on discrimination i love a great courtroom drama this one was merely good with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two hour film they had to take a few shortcuts here sad ain t it but even so a well intentioned film that i m glad i saw once not twice once is enough thank you

wish they d make a better version i am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year i show the movie and this is a terrible version they leave out almost the whole story and change the rest it is such a great book and i think they could have done a better job on the video i am always hoping a newer and better version is made 
weak pulse in spite of its intriguing premise pulse ultimately falls flat due to its slow pace and mediocre performances the story focuses on a mysterious lightning storm that somehow converts electrical energy into a self serving intelligent killer a little boy joey lawrence is visiting his father and new bride in california and he is convinced there are voices in the electricity cliff deyoung is lifeless in his role as dad roxanne hart brings some conviction to her role as the new wife we re never really sure just what is going on and how electrical energy can also manage to lock doors including a shower door and all the terror elements are so underplayed they re never really all that threatening

great yoga tape i do not think so i think there are two major problems with this tape first in no way it is suitable for beginners instructor cues for breathing are inconsistent about of the time there is no cueing at all her cues for poses are very poor she mostly mentions if the pose is hard to do or not you cannot follow her without looking at your tv screen and if you do not know which muscles to flex or stretch of the time she is not going to tell you the program does contain two levels for more and less flexible yet transition from one pose to another is so quick that you can barely get your balance try jane fonda yoga instead or and kundahlini yoga 
really dumb disney flick they chosen robin williams to be in a disney movie and this movie turned out to be very corny special effects are dull though if i were a kid i would probably like this movie but now that i m i think it s stupid i think i saw it in theater when i was and i don t remember much of it but i think it s not in stores anymore out to buy because people don t really care much about this movie anymore i don t care about it either i m glad this movie is out of stock and it should be it is very boring ! 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
george mihalka should have got the bullet before compromising michael caine into this but what else could you expect from trash made for tv sorry for the redundancy 
who s that knocking in the woods the tommyknockers is one of the more unsuccessful of stephen king adaptations to hit the screen originally a tv miniseries the movie suffers from lackluster direction mediocre performances and no sense of true suspense or horror typically set in a homey little new england town the plot centers on the discovery of a mysterious object in the woods by a local writer marg helgenberger who along with her alcoholic poet boyfriend a poorly cast jimmy smits decides to keep it a secret until the whole thing is unearthed meanwhile a ghostly green light emits from the object causing the townspeople to go bonkers in one form or another whether it be by inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around with glowing green eyes at three hours the tommyknockers definitely overstays its welcome and that is one problem in watching a miniseries in one take it can become redundant tighter direction and a more focused cast could have helped but aside from john ashton eg marshall and joanna cassidy in supporting roles most of the performances seem phone in and traci lords is ridiculously hilarious as the postal slut a real misfire 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up

movies like this make you ask was this sequel really neccessary the original jungle book was inventive whitty uplifting and charming the characters had depth and a beauty that in its time was unique and wonderful the original disney jungle book story was told with great feeling that was a source of fun and inspiration to me growing up as an autistic child i can honestly say the original disney jungle book movie was the only movie i loved that also touched my heart jungle book is is just a very badly executed attempt at recreating the awesomeness of the the original disney jungle book jungle book fails in all attempts to recreate any of the magic of the original disney jungle book jungle book is endlessly bland overall filled with nothing at all to justify wasting a moment of your life watching you will be better and more deeply entertained for hours watching newly poured cement dry compared to watching a moment of jungle book don t waste your time wacthing this garbage it is not worth anyones time or money it gets one star only because the amazon system does not allow me to post zero stars or better still stars in negative numbers 
the ahemlesser farrelly film ok check it out there s two jack blacks one is the guy from tenacious d you see him all the time he s funny and childish and insane then there s the other jack black he s the evil creature who pervades films like shallow hal and king kong whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident well as long as you aren t fat and don t feel patronized by gweneth presuming to know what it s like not to be desired all her life ha then by all means suspend all disbelief logic and brain power and watch this dumb movie gweneth s fat suit is actually pretty convincing although most of the movie she s played by an actual fat chick who by the way should have just been left in without the whole ha ha the dude thinks she s skinny nonsense obviously a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if a he weren t brainwashedb his fat girlfriend wasn t replaced by a twiggy blond chickc the movie didn t throw ridiculous concepts your way like a guy could have sex with a lb woman without realizing it d tony robbins was in no way involved whatsoeveri knew i was slumming it when i saw this movie but i m not sure what the message of this film is jack black s character is decent considerate great with kids and perfect in every way oh except he s really shallow for no dicernable reason other than his dad s dying words were for him to go out and chase tail the weird part is that hal s not a bad person the movie beats you over the head showing you he s the nicest guy on on the face of the earth so you can t really laugh at him looking like an idiot rosemary is so fat she has superpowers her butt actually creates typhoons i wonder if that has military applications suddenly hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews tony robbins brainwashed him the fiend ! when hal finally realizes this he decides to ooh big spoiler love rosemary anyway and learns a valuble lesson along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he s dating rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non judgemental he is dating a fat girl cause that would make any woman melt of course there s requisite best friend played by jason alexander who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get hal to dump her then again the friend is a complete troll so i don t know why hal would want him around and to insult us further they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a serious note about how true beauty is on the inside too manypublicservicemessages pick one but brain dead writing aside paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit despite gweneth s postering when this film was first released regardless of its clumsy benevolence i have to rate this as a romantic comedy and for that i give it a rating of totally unremarkable nice gesture farelly brothers not to be bothered with 
let s bore film fans to death i tried this one based on other submitted reviews and was sorely disappointed where were the scares a little trippy it hints at being a countercultural horror film easy rider on vampire island interior monologue from our heroine jessica reflects her insecurities about what her friends will think of her but offer no insights into her mental illness this is the film s one and only device and the filmmakers have no idea what to do with it boring 
van damme fans only i struggle with this movie i m a die hard fan of jean claude van damme so part of me really likes this movie but the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct tovideo with a slow script uninteresting characters and horrendously bad acting save for jcvd himself having said this i can honestly reccomend it to fans of van damme they will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from brussles kick the tar out of some low life hicks while drinking with his indian buddy and pickin up chicks if this appeals to you there shouldn t be any reason why you wouldn t like desert heat if even one of this doesn t sound good stay far away 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
john travolta and samuel l jackson again so the first thing you need to know about this movie is that it sucks it really does i m not sure who their military consultant was but if samuel l has specialist pins on his collars you don t call him sargeant women aren t allowed in the rangers nunez not my rules ladies colonel styles looks a little young to be a colonel even for the army the army doesn t issue tiger stripe bdu s mueller the list goes on and on this may not seem that important but if you re gonna make a movie about the army you could at least get some very basic soory could t resist things correct yes it s true that there are many twists and turns in this plot but all that really means at least in this case is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay hey if we tell the same story a couple different ways it makes the story really interesting right not so much oh and that scene where specialist west is standing on top of that shack with his pancho blowing like a villains cape wow who decided that was a good idea i don t want to ruin the ending for you because there s no point in even seeing this movie and anyone with enough brain cells to operate the remote will figure out the finale long before it makes its belated arrival by the way how do you follow someone in an army humvee w out them knowing seriously please spend these or minutes talking with your kid s reading a book excercising writing a review i dunno something worthy of your precious time you ve been warned by the way connie nielsen looks hot w short red hair 
read the book instead this movie the story of a shocking long ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious elizabeth hurley s and sean penn s characters are laughable caricatures anita shreve s writings never disappoint read the book instead 
rip off like many of the other reviewers i feel cheated anything contoversial was left out as a dumb suburban honkey myself i demand the reissue of this dvd with kill the white people what good are all those funny sketches if snl doesn t have the balls to put them on dvd i also didn t read any reviews as i assumed i was getting the same product that was put on vhs years ago instead i got scammed what s even worse is the bonus scene is the opie cunningham interview which was already on the original vhs please explain how this is a bonus i was furious when the movie ended the least they can do is put out a part i thought i was buying the cadillac of comedy instead i got the ford pinto of crap 
an abomination i am a big fan of this franchise however i refuse to include this in the series ! they should ve put the title national lampoon s before this it s the worse horror sequel i have ever seen and coming from me that is pretty bad because i have seen them all leatherface has never been played so horribly ! during the majority of the movie he looked like a phat bull dyke ! renee zellweger hadn t finished her acting classes obviously she was terrible and i wanted her to be hung up on a hook i heard she went cross country stopping at every video store she passed in an effort to buy and burn every rental copy she could get her hands on ! the sad fact is this will always be around to haunt both her and matthew mcconaughey 
regional issues unless i missed it it was unclear that the video download only worked in certain regions so i ended up wasting my money 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
garbage this movie was really a waste of money the writing the directin are all very bad it is also very low budget which i thought would increase the realness but i was wrong safe your money and keep searchin 
the plan of cannibal films if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust the grindhouse release is well worth the money however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful the picture quality is horrendous the movie is lacking any redeemable quality there are a few violent moments but just a few one of the absolute worst italian horror exploitation films made if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films then ferox is the plan 
dull and boring this trick should refund your money like most indie gay themed movies trick had quite a bit of buzz around it a terrific movie with tori spelling ! how could i not love it i loved die mommy die ! girls will be girls and jeffrey so i gotta love this too right right i found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality a hot go go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb uh why so they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy and then it s one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans as much as i can t stand tori spelling s acting she s the only performer not phoning it in maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots what little life there is in this movie it owes it to her the problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking the sizzling dancer looked like bored monkey and the soft sensitive gabriel has no personality why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery i guess if go go boy dropped the zero and found another guy which wouldn t be too much of an effort for him there wouldn t be much of a movie a cameo by miss coco peru is a nice treat but she s lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish you d think she was in a different movie high expectations very low gratification honestly skip it 
this version is a very bad remake of a very good film greetings to one and all just wanted you to know that if you are looking for a pretty good film called the desperate hours this is not the one you want to watch you want to watch the version with humphrey bogart and fredric march this is the remake with mickey rourke and anthony hopkins the original is a taunt drama in which a man discovers that his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by a trio of gangster escaped from prison and focuses on his desperate attempts to save their lives this remake is exercise in terror in which the sadistic violence of the criminals becomes the driving force of the story and the goal is to see how far they will go before they are finally stopped on paper you would have thought anthony hopkins could do a marvelous job in the role of the father but the script pretty much makes that impossible turning the bad guy into a major league psychotic just destroys the psychological chess game that made the original so compelling rourke is simply the wrong choice for the role always coming across as a sick punk rather than a criminal menace but then few actors are going to be able to play against hopkins even when he is in low gear i cannot believe anybody would watch this film twice i only watched it because i was interested to see how they updated the original the ending of which i just watched again on television of course the ending would be more violent but it was the elegance of the ending of the original as the hero saves his family with an unloaded gun that made it stand out this one is just a splatter flick dressed up a bit to fool you go check out the original because like rourke s character you do not want this in your house anywhere near your family 
lean pickin s beautifully photographed but over produced historical women s picture on an epic scale yes it has its fans but so do those dime adozen bodice ripper romance novels on supermarket racks still gorgeous cinematography and a lusher thanlush musical score can t disguise the fact that this david lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions a pallid sarah miles manages to suggest what julie christie might have done with this part horribly miscast robert mitchum plays a flower pressing milquetoast and a dazed looking christopher jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed however john mills received richly deserved oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence no wonder he s speechless 
the king of sleeze jing wong forgets that he had jet li starring in this movie jing wong truly sinks to a new low with this movie jet has one oustanding action sequence but other than that he just isn t used jacky cheung is the star of this movie and plays an actor who absolutely never uses stunt doubles it became apparent within minutes that this movie was made to make fun of jackie chan of course it didn t have to be so obvious but jing wong just keeps driving it into your head that he does his own stunts so if you are familiar with jing then you know this isn t going to be a tribute to jackie oh no it is a punch to the throat through the movie screen jet li plays cheung s bodyguard and ends up doing the a stunt for him after setting up his stupid jackie chan character jing tries to do a remake of die hard remember how you never knew what bruce willis was going to do and it was always surprising well jing makes about the worst movie possible from here on instead of being clever he makes jet just keep storming in on the hostages and then flee at one point he takes a helicopter up and starts shooting right into the buiding at the main bad guy with all of the hostages standing around after the helicopter crashes into the side of the building it doesn t blow up it just destroys everything on that floor so other than one outstanding action sequence between jet li and ben lam guy with sunglasses this movie is a complete waste of time even billy chow couldn t save this one of course it would help if wong jing was smart enough to capitalize on the success of billy chow and jet li in fist of legend but instead we don t get to see them fight and get to look at billy chow in a thong yeah that it just what i am looking for the universal laser and video company version is ok but the imbedded subtitles are sometimes hard to read there is a version of this released by dimension video grrrrthat has been retitled meltdown and has been shortened by minutes and also has gotten a horrible new soundtrack including english dubbing and rap music replacing what was in the original doesn t matter which one you get because the chinese version isn t really any better since it is not a good movie to begin with 
bad baby bad okay it s not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion it does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis on the other hand the film lacks true suspense i was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn the baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum the pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn t stand up that well today the actors who took part in this didn t go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel why there was a sequel is beyond me i recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but i was only five at the time at the most this is a rent not a buy i guess good for it s time but perhaps a re make would pump some needed life into the story 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
like all gossip a lot of talk about nothing a very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level the movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue i ve heard better lines in fast times at richmond high thank you altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing don t believe the great reviews about this film the film might appeal to the year old crowds fantasizing about how cool college life might be with all the cool people and parties if you re not in that category skip this boring film and save both your time and your money 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
bow wow i can t understand the good reviews given by others to this movie frankly i thought it was a dog not to say that it had no redeeming features the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing if improbable and the girl herself was a real sweetie and a good actress perfect for the part in fact the acting all around was admirable but the script ! yikes ! not a single character in the whole movie with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists had any motivation for anything they did people acting awkward or mean in fact just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean or spiteful or stupid for no reason at all it seems as though somehow the movie could have been good but didn t make it call it almost watchable i came away from lawn dogs yawn dogs feeling not at all enriched puzzled perhaps at why anyone would make such a movie well there was that admirable unlikely friendship but that was all pass this one by 
kill meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee kill meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this movie is the worst movie of all all all time since the history of the universe and before that ! in theaters i was the only one watching that movie and i felt like walking out i wanted to cry the actors stink along with the plot and d effects all i can say is boooooooooo this movie sucks 
stealing beauty the movie could have been so much more with less caracter s liv tyler is very good rachel weisz is only in the movie for short stints but memberable ones the soundtract is better than the film 
crumb ripoff i started liking this movie i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal underground cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late if you like the depressing gritty wild fastpaced style of this movie check out the original master robert crumb toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of this is crap in noncomformity and dont say i didnt get it i just think hes being hugely self indulgent and this whole thing is an homage gone awry lacking the wit psychedelia and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly 
a sorry movie i wrote a huge review for this and don t know where it is but let me give you the short version they don t continue the story that is until the end of the movie and that was the part trhat ruined the movie for me the movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married enter the bride she of course doesn t want anybody to be happy so the story is not really worth going over it is just injected and there are no real emotions except of course for an ending that really po ed me the only reason this movie gets a stars and almost gets a is for christy chung not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth she is a great actress so i know of movies now that are only worth watching for her this and red wolf it may be because the people she works with are so terrible but to tell the truth christy chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time not a big deal since it was only like a minute long movie 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
a colorful yet disappointing attempt to capture doyle s idea the color and cgi s are excellent in this film the location shots are great and the attempt to capture the late s successful however the female character is obnoxious and certainly un becoming in attitude language and appearance while this might be the s and women should be able to handle strong lead characters this woman who was the financial backer of the expedition was disgusting there have been several major cinematic attempts at this story but this version leaves a lot to be desired

he didn t go far enough oleanna is about a twisted vicious young woman s need to bring a man and by extention all men down john played by william macy is a college professor carol played by debra eisenstadt is one of his students when carol seeks help for a failing grade john goes out of his way to help her personally on a one to one basis carol is more than a little irritating and john becomes more than a little irritated by her seeming inability to grasp the simplist concepts playing the good professor john faults his pedantic self for her failure to understand the material days later john is caught off guard when carol maliciously levels the charge of sexual harrasment against him just in time to destroy his bid for tenure her earlier need for help has been a set up carol has been keeping notes all along cataloging any word or action she might turn against him carol s campaign against john is facilitated by what she refers to as the group that is to say by the usual nest of ideological feminists on campus in which carol has found herself and a place for her sexual neuroses she comes fully armed with her feminist groupthink about sexual harrassment and rape her arguments against john rest on rejecting the evidence of one s own senses in favor of a left wing vocabulary thick with words like patriarchal hegemonic classism and an obvious hatred of men the director david mamet tests the audiences patience as carol apes the usual post modern jardon that would put into question our everyday intersubjective common sense consensus about the meaning of our everyday words and actions especially the everyday words and actions of men for carol and the group reality is always trapped between parentheses because it is always determined by power and those who have it men had it in the past she and her group have it now her reality takes precedence over john s carol eventually trumps her charge of sexual harrassment with a charge of rape and john bless his heart loses his inhibitions about hitting a woman all in all this movie held my attention made me needlessly anxious and pissed me off just enough to want to write my take on it 
not one of sellers best sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie but peter sellers did many better films than this dr strangelove was the masterpiece being there is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in washington the world of henry orient at last on dvd ! is priceless but virtually unknown with delicious performances from sellers and especially his teenage tormentors finally the pink panther series is much better slapstick than after the fox which has many famous talented participants but is mostly silly unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as clouseau co one irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations as if we might not notice them otherwise i agree with other reviewers that victor mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted and martin balsam does okay with his stuff too when watching this film i kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant i could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money 
negative stars if i could i would give this movie stars for each minute of my life i wasted on it such a disappointment for fans of the original starship troopers it pretty much comes down to being a bad slasher movie the only decent special effects scene was recycled from the first starship troopers the first scene in the movie is comical it is so bad for fans of the first starship troopers who are curious about this movie i m saving you the suspense and valuable hour and a half of your life 
direct to video potboiler re tread that never should have been made this direct to video sequel is actually more of a re tread of the original guilty pleasure erotic thriller film noir potboiler and another of the countless and pointless direct to video sequels to come from sony comlumbiatristar as of late cruel intentions starship troopers shall i go on wild things focuses around a rich girl susan ward whose stepfather mysteriously dies and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival son of the beach s hot leila arcieri who claims to be the man s true biological daughter naturally just like in the original there are plot twists aplenty as learned by an insurance investigator isiah washington giving a somewhat inspired performance and naturally there are double crosses murders and a redux of the first film s threesome only it s not as erotic as the original s wild things isn t just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it s good points it s a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate is it worth seeing depends how much you liked the first wild things but for the rest of us just watch the original and forget this ever happened 
watch out for faulty vhs tapes while the young ones is indeed a truly hysterically funny tv show when i ordered the vhs tapes i was suprised to see that though brand new the sound level on the first tape for the first min was so low as to be nearly inaudible and that the second tape would not play at all in the vhs player just a heads up 
pan and scan mockery of a comic book classic this edition of the film sucks and sucks again the wide screen version of this is a masterpiece without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that bava intended each shot was carefully composed and not intended to be butchered this edition is a travesty especially when it s purported to be put out by fans do you re homework there are also scenes missing from this print scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience hey i thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts instead its just sloppy and self indulgent look for the earlier laser disc edition as for the extras do we really need the it s great because i used it in my video slop and it s great because i did a bad homage ripoff slop the documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that s what was great about it then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image ! strikes me a total scumminess all in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted by a few lazy lard asses with a quick fix mentality 
possibly the most boring film i have seen unfortunately i was made to watch this film in a french class i took while i could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character s face it was honestly one of the most boring films i have ever seen it s difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters faces 
controversy not quality it was probably brave to make any sort of a film out of rudi van danzig s book doubtless the controversial part of the subject matter of this film an year old boy part willingly seduced by a year old soldier was the reason that it was awarded the best film and audience prize at turin in it cannot have been for any artistic merit or general craft competence when jeroen and his mother emerge from their flat we are expected to believe that this is amsterdam after more than years of nazi occupation and deprivation the flats and street are in immaculately good condition the children being packed off to friesland so that rest of their families shan t starve are pictures of good health was the budget for this film so pathetically low that the producers could not drive around the netherlands coastline to find a village for the arrival of the canadian liberators where there weren t bollards on the footpaths to stop people parking cars there doubtless mcdonald s was just around the corner i laughed i thought of monty python as to the main topic of the film the relationship between the soldier and the boy do not expect this to remain totally from the child s perspective as it is in the book there are trite lines of self explanation from the soldier the book quite believably develops the relationship between the child and the man the film doesn t since the film is only minutes long perhaps the answer is a censor s sharp scissors not an example of the film makers overall artistic failure or perhaps they just hadn t got enough money for enough scenes the small redeeeming part of the film is the depiction of the devoutly protestant people of this ultra provincial part of the netherlands i believed this representation in this the film shares it s small success with another poor film set in an extreme end of a maritime country which relies on sex to get people to watch it breaking the waves do not expect this film to bear more than a passing resemblance to van dantzig s book do not expect to see a work of art don t waste your money on this dvd instead if you haven t done so already buy the book 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
bad times ve has a ton of potential but it just doesn t work out brandy davis is both cute and sexy of course but playboy s testing the limits is a much better showcase for her um talents not to be mean but most of the film s other women just aren t that attractive and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack contrary to a previous reviewer the massage scene is fairly ordinary the girl girl stripper scene is the most disappointing however it starts really well with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action the only scene worth watching at all is blue collar vignette with two girls and one guy hooking up stay away from this one 
thirteen year old janey is a victim of sexual abuse this is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting and no i m not even slightly exaggerating it is also bizarre that i am the sole reviewer to point this out janey is only a year old teenager she is indeed rather mature for her age nonetheless janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her such an adult male or female is clearly breaking the law janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined the father is being played for a fool this dysfunctional family seems doomed janey s younger brother needs her love and protection is she capable of handling this responsibility will matters finally get out of control rain is morally bankrupt the story line takes place in new zealand perhaps the people associated with the american tv program to catch a predator and perverted justice should visit this country david thomsonflares into darknes 
the name says it all this movie is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen these minutes seemed more like hours and for chrissake he s not an american 
great movie horrible dvd the move is one of my favorite sci fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to dvd that i have seen there are no special features and no chapter stops this is as if they copied a video tape to a dvd i could accecpt it being full frame but if i had known that it was this cheap a transfer i would not have purchased it 
great movie lousy dvd while this is a great movie this dvd reproduction does it severe injustice the sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the dvd is marginal 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
memories of midnight this movie was terribly dissapointing the other side of midnight is one of my all time favorites and i could not wait to see this movie the characters and story line are weak and unsophisticated compared to osom i loved jane s business attire she dressed to the t in this movie and the scenery in greece and venice were lovely and that s about it i would not watch this mini series again jane seymore was wonderful in quotsomewhere in time quot 
disappointing what a disappointment seeing kline ronstadt and smith on the cover as well as in the description i believed this was the movie version i should have read further through the reviews however the misleading was not necessary how many have you sold to unsuspecting innocents like me even so i would have enjoyed this had it been acceptable quality the quality is extremely poor the remastering done very sloppily the color washed out and the camera angles leaving one quite distracted from the performance and i paid although i see it is being advertised for thumbs down 
defense of jamie gertz i m writing because i thought fine s review was bad i was interested in this movie because it has jamie gertz who has proven to be a durable dependable character actress mr fine may or may not have talent but he is not spectacular waspishness insults are passe and not becoming to a serious reviewer ms gertz by contrast turns an abundance of personality to good account through her career i just don t know what untalented means in the context of this silly movie but it was twenty years ago is the insult intended to be forthe movie or for her whole career since kbad form and fuzzy thinking i think the movie is an attempt to imitate features of flashdance upbeat background music meaningless but interesting visuals skill display romance people with aspirations surviving at a humble level jamie gertz is the face girl 
what a bunch of village idiots at first i was really hyped to see this movie with the big named stars especially ms weaver but when it was over i shouted i knew it for a hard core horror movie fan like myself that s definitely a sign of a bad movie review to come this movie broke my record of figuring out the plot even before the first minute was through and the only reason why i sat through the entire movie was because i had my check book to balance and a few crypto puzzles to complete the village reminded me of nothing more than a slap shod script tossed around for a few days among amature script editors then rushed into the credulous hands of famous stars not only did this movie ruin a few good careers it also ruined my respect for those who stared in it tip for the day if someone gives you a free copy of the village sell it on an auction site immediately trust me you won t feel guilty getting rid of it as fast as you can you ll experience more suspense selling it to the highest bidder than having to sit through the entire movie 
to bad not my cup a tea poor sound and average picture just for excalibur freaks 
the postman is a very seriously boring movie the postman is a very seriously boring movie with terrible story line one of the most conspicuous flops of its decade and there is good reason for it i had to write this review when i saw that there were several people actually rating this movie at stars seriously guys you forgot to take your pills this morning and your friends will the white coats will be visiting later to check on you until then please refrain from using your pc as we are in danger of obliteration of good taste 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
dissapointing this dvd is a complete rip off the performance is more focussed on bonos sunglasses with a camera in his sun glasses of all things keep it simple and exciting that means proper editing its oviuous this editor should nt be editing any shows what so ever and needs lessons as to how to tell a story to an audience we are not at the show so stop trying to create an atmosphere of swishing shots because the atmosphere for the viewers is the flaming living room and your job is to bring something into the room not try and pull you in with disasterous effects what a great big switch of off on the remote and a dollar cash in at the second hand store thnak you very much for nothing 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
avoid this drivel at all costs if amazon allowed zero stars this would get it absolutely awful 
throw timecop in the garbage bin because it s nothing but trash if you want to checkout a good jason scott lee film i recommend the following dragon the bruce lee storyrapa nui timecop the berlin decision is an awful film awful production values awful acting awful script i would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances asian american awareness in hollywood this film does neither i would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing if you are curious perhaps a rental from netflix but this film is definitely not for keeps if you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your asian american film awareness and came away disappointed then i recommend the following films for your personal viewing these are well written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of asian american actors better luck tomorrowmulan 
the lisbon suicides therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages and cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood s boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room on the second floor of a two story house and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon s neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run ofthemill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she s not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip s request knowing nothing but trip s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick of course but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
supernova in the classroom does anyone know if there is a real pg version of this film i ve been told it came out as a pg and then was changed to an r film pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
no copy recieved i never recieved this item so i cant review it id like it sent i vaguely remeber ordering it so if i its on backorder or ill be recieving it soon let me know please thanks

samuel jackson a pharmacological genius yeah ! sure talking about a misscast samuel jackson can portray a hitman a pimp or a thief but a pharmacological genius yeah right 
are there o stars i am soooooooo mad i ve just wasted almost two hours of my life watching this movie and why because of the reviewers that gave this piece of sh and star ratings what exactly are you people on that you would even remotely like this film maybe it s that pretentious high brow snobbery that the best pseudo intellectuals are versed in i like alot of french films betty blue amelie etc but this is sheer garbarge couched in lets see how much i can piss off my audience before they claim i m a genius the next time someone wants to make a movie like this please give the money and the camera to year old with a iq i guarantee it will be alot better 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
ok but no charm lorna is pretty and her suitor is devoted the story holds your attention for many that is enough some auspicious beginnings without depth so maybe stars for some people i give stars if i do not keep it to watch again in later years i found the romance unfulfilling and so the movie romance movies that i liked better are north south pride prejudice wives and daughters and a walk to remember adventure with romance the scarlet pimpernel 
a sorry movie i wrote a huge review for this and don t know where it is but let me give you the short version they don t continue the story that is until the end of the movie and that was the part trhat ruined the movie for me the movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married enter the bride she of course doesn t want anybody to be happy so the story is not really worth going over it is just injected and there are no real emotions except of course for an ending that really po ed me the only reason this movie gets a stars and almost gets a is for christy chung not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth she is a great actress so i know of movies now that are only worth watching for her this and red wolf it may be because the people she works with are so terrible but to tell the truth christy chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time not a big deal since it was only like a minute long movie 
big deal mr director taking gratuitous advantage of inner city poor seems a cheap shot for a wealthy white man i have one question for the director why don t you make a movie and expose the degenerate aspects of your own people exploiting others is no way to make your way in this world even though such behavior made your father rich you should try to be a better man 
the quality to dvd is appalling raise the red lantern is a wonderful movie with a great story when i had heard that this movie was going to be transfered to dvd format i was thrilled and then i bought the dvd and to my dismay within the first couple of minutes into the movie there were white lines and distortion since i loved the movie so much i thought i would make an exception for the first few minutes but as the movie continued so did the white lines i could not believe what i was seeing the dvd copy of this movie reminded me of the old movies i use to see years ago when there were only channels on tv and not only is the visual appearance of this movie distorted so is the sound it s very harsh and nasally i am on my way out the door to return this dvd and ask for a refund 
off the formula but still disappointing the rebel withaheartofgoldwholearnsthemeaningoflove scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures which were very popular in the movies and on tv at that time the quoteuropeanquot setting got elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction were basic to say the least and the music was uninspired and badly mixed on record the movie does have one of presley s best set of opening productiom numbers quotlong legged girl quot and others are rousing tunes delivered with that presley panache often missing from his late s efforts but about minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan reaches for a magazine an interesting sidelight is that his co star was a true quotdiscoveryquot an english teenager making her screen debut with elvis presley ! she handles the light hearted assignment very well indeed even the quotold macdonald quot sequence which usually is reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack album cut 
ehhh so so it s a so so film with rourke in the ira some good stuff look for anthony stewart head as rupert note anthony stewart head portraits another rupert rupert giles on the tv show buffy the vampire slayer so now you know but this one is so so like i sai 
wish i would have paid attention vanity ! nude ! bizarre story ! sounds perfect ! what more could one want how about a decent transfer to dvd had i been paying attention i would have noticed this dvd was released by jef films which is known for its shoddy and cheap quality i have other dvds from jef films which i purchased because those films are available only from that company and the quality is just as bad it appears they transfer these films from old vhs copies which renders the video quality nearly impossible to watch it is painfully obvious the company is only interested in making money and doesn t care at all about issuing a quality product vanity stars the movie itself stars the dvd stars 
dissappointing i wasn t expecting disney but i was less than thrilled by this feature i m assuming there s a genera of animation produced in the mid s that took the whole stoner heavy metal thing and ran with it many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story i am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything but i couldn t get through this whole film 
why waste the cash this is a poor excuse of a movie the actors are less than right for these rolls i will be selling this movie used if anyone wants to waste the cash 
sickening after seeing this film i am pretty amazed they have been able to put what they did on to a dvd i actually felt sickened by the images i saw and had to turn it off many times yes its an interesting documentary but can you imagine how the victims family felt knowing the images of their loved one being violently stabbed were being shown to people personally i think you ve got to have a strong stomach to watch it 
a dissapointment if you are looking for a production that captures the magic of the original met production of amahl and the night visitors stay away from this one you will be sorely dissapointed and embarassed if you are showing it to others 
another one of those silly s movies the jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap stick sight gags i normally wouldn t have bought a movie like this but i needed it to make my johnny depp library complete 
this version is a very bad remake of a very good film greetings to one and all just wanted you to know that if you are looking for a pretty good film called the desperate hours this is not the one you want to watch you want to watch the version with humphrey bogart and fredric march this is the remake with mickey rourke and anthony hopkins the original is a taunt drama in which a man discovers that his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by a trio of gangster escaped from prison and focuses on his desperate attempts to save their lives this remake is exercise in terror in which the sadistic violence of the criminals becomes the driving force of the story and the goal is to see how far they will go before they are finally stopped on paper you would have thought anthony hopkins could do a marvelous job in the role of the father but the script pretty much makes that impossible turning the bad guy into a major league psychotic just destroys the psychological chess game that made the original so compelling rourke is simply the wrong choice for the role always coming across as a sick punk rather than a criminal menace but then few actors are going to be able to play against hopkins even when he is in low gear i cannot believe anybody would watch this film twice i only watched it because i was interested to see how they updated the original the ending of which i just watched again on television of course the ending would be more violent but it was the elegance of the ending of the original as the hero saves his family with an unloaded gun that made it stand out this one is just a splatter flick dressed up a bit to fool you go check out the original because like rourke s character you do not want this in your house anywhere near your family 
one of elvis worst movies i ve seen all of elvis movies most several times this is one of the worst only stay away joe and harem scarem are worse i usually watch every elvis movie every time it comes on tv but not these three 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
it s so stupid but not funny i don t even know how cheech and chong fans could like this movie because this movie is really different from up in smoke or their other movies in up in smoke there was at least some direction to the movie but in this movie most of it is composed of lame comedy gimmicks that were entirely not funny unless you are high off your ass or have an i q less than they don t even smoke in this movie ! the closest thing they do to drugs is eat some marijuana leaves how stupid do they think we are stay away from this one 
no teeth to this one maybe i was just expecting something like jaws but i didn t think this movie that great i watched it twice now only because i kept falling asleep the first time the script is very weak and thus so is the story the acting is flat most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from existing documentaries i have seen photographs of at least one scene you can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for the movie are very poorly done don t waste your money if you want to watch it rent it don t buy it 
women in prison sleaze italian style this joe d amato film takes the women in prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze bordering on pornography the plot or lack thereof is typical woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption to make the film last minutes joe d amato fills the story with lesbianism vile tortures naked women in rat infested sewers and plenty of gratuitous sex i gave this movie star because there is no option for a star rating even hardcore fans of euro sex queen laura gemser will find this one a total bore 
a rather boring movie adaptation despite vincent price s brilliance i simply thought that the fall of the house of usher was rather boring and i found myself dozing off i thought that the pit and the pendulum was a much better flick and a much more interesting adaptation in fact i was quite disappointed with this adaptation of edgar allan poe s brilliant short story fall of the house of usher while the movie provides a grim atmosphere in accordance with the poe s story the movie drags and never really picks up enough steam to keep one s interest however i found the actual story written by poe to be quite interesting and very entertaining perhaps that is my problem with the movie as it is not nearly as good as the story itself this movie the fall of the house of usher could have been much better notwithstanding the poor adaptation of poe s classic story of despair vincent price as always was terrific in his role still this is not enough to make this a good adaptation i recommend watching the clearly superior the pit and the pendulum instead of this flick 
eh ive seen worse if you want a review of the plot itself complete with spoilers feel free to read the other reviews my biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed again and again due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn t keep the story straight there is a homage to asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm that would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film there are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible that said it was a bit enjoyable the cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given if the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked maybe i would have cared what happened to them the dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say oooh cool good premise good effects good acting but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
so glad it was free i rented this movie because i registered my tivo with amazon and got the credit i thought it might be a good opportunity to see some movies i wouldn t normally rent i watched the trailer on this thought it looked like it might be amusing and downloaded it unfortunately the only funny scene in the movie was in the trailer and i ended up falling asleep the first minutes into it after i woke up i thought maybe i hadn t given it a fair shot and went back to try it again i was right to fall asleep the first time through i don t usually rate movies or anything for that matter but felt compelled to share my opinion with anyone who was seriously considering spending money on this one spend that on a burger or a good book anything else but this 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
great horses movie is horrible but horses are fabulous ! this is some of the best footage of the fabled andalusian horses i ve ever seen if there s more out there somebody please let me know ! bought the movie just to see the horses 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
if you re looking for a fairy tale this is the movie for you aside from some of the special effects this is the worst movie i have ever seen the story is basically an updated version of pinnochio and it left me feeling cheated i kept watching it becaue i expected so much more but it never and i do mean never delivered i believe that i was supposed to feel pained over what the human race suffers but i just felt sad that i spent so much time with this movie 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
saving the world from giant grasshoppers a review by the students in ent insects on film clemson university clemson sc spring when better to meet your new man than while saving the world from giant radioactive grasshoppers ! that s what happened to audrey ames in beginning of the end the black and white movie produced in takes place in a small illinois town called ludlow near the big city of chicago the main character audrey is a persistent reporter who discovers a new and interesting story on her way to write about a lackluster flying demonstration on her way to the flying demo she is stopped at a roadblock in the town of ludlow illinois it seems that the town has been mysteriously destroyed overnight ! following a lead audrey goes to the u s department of agriculture and meets with the project director named dr ed wainwright in order to find out more about what happened dr wainwright tells audrey about a wheat factory that was demolished in the same area before the destruction of ludlow ed audrey and ed s co worker frank go to investigate the abandoned grain bins while they are there a locust comes from the woods and eats ed s co worker they finally realize what is destroying the towns and eating the people although it s a little too late for poor frank johnson determined to resolve the problem the military enlists the help of dr wainwright who tries to find a sound frequency that mimics the sound grasshoppers make before they attack the viewer of this film will be held in utter suspense until at a climatic moment dr wainwright discovers the right frequency and saves the city of chicago from the military s impending drop of an atom bomb the sound is broadcast from a boat in a lake outside of chicago and the sound attracts the grasshoppers to the lake as the grasshoppers follow the luring sound they eventually end up in the lake where they meet a watery death the city of chicago is safe and everyone lives happily ever after except sadly those who were eaten alive by the radioactive grasshoppers while this movie has extremely entertaining moments such as when the grasshoppers scale the skyscrapers of chicago looking for food the movie in general is a b attempt at science fiction also the movie was produced during the s resulting in minimal attempts at realistic special effects the special effects are entertaining at best and add humor more than substance to the movie the viewer also might be left with several questions after watching this movie like why can t the national guard protect the citizens from grasshoppers or why is it more funny than tragic when dr wainwright s deaf mute assistance gets eaten alive by a grasshopper on a scientific or scholarly level the movie has several errors the most important error in the entomological sense is the noise that the grasshoppers make throughout the movie to make the noise that they did in the movie they would need wings in the movie though the characters say that the grasshoppers could not fly because they didn t have wings also the scientist indicates that the giant vegetables were produced through radioactivity which allows for photosynthesis to occur both day and night for photosynthesis to occur light must be present thus raising the question of how the vegetables could continue to expand during the darkness of night the inability of the grasshoppers to burn in the fires set by the military reflects an error as well in reality grasshoppers are highly flammable because of their wax like coating finally the plot as a whole is completely unrealistic and so bizarre that the movie should be placed in the comedy opposed to science fiction genre while clemson university research may have led to the evacuation of mole crickets from golf course greens using technological concepts similar to those presented in the movie the likelihood that radioactive grasshoppers would eat hundreds of people is improbable beginning of the end is an amusing movie to watch ! the acting is traditional of the sci fi movies of the era the special effects are mediocre but the humor in retrospect is delightful if you are a fan of cheesy sci fi suspense movies give this flick a try ! you will not be disappointed who knows maybe you ll learn something that could save the world the next time we are attacked by radioactive bugs 
anti southern propaganda this movies rates right up there with schindlers list in terms of unapologetic propaganda fortunately ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making gettysburg and the even better gods and generals if you want to see a real accurate depiction of the war for southern independence aka the civil war watch gods and generals or gone with the wind and stay away from movie garbage like andersonville also watch for the extended version dvd of gods and generals coming for the christmas season of 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
clint runs afowl of the cold war again maybe it s because he is such a stright shooter pun ment or something but clint doesn t do cold war thrillers very well remember firefox while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they don t cover up the fact that it was a good book that doesn t watch as good as it read some may like it but i found it to be a let down 
why aren t zero stars available for rating maybe i should have known better but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same this is a four dollar movie in any department store 
not for dvd aficionados i m rather upset with the technical quality of this dvd grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in without so much as a x animorphic upgrade this is certainly not worth the dollar price tag amazon com has right now 
la femme fonda the gutsy performance of bridget fonda is the only saving grace of this ultra violent nihilistic remake of the french hit la femme nikita director john badham manages to keep the action tense and suspenseful but the writers expect a lot from viewers how can one truly identify and or empathize with fonda s character she s really a cold blooded killer with little grace or worth even after her pygmalion like transformation she is still the same ruthless woman only we are now supposed to sympathize with her and wish her well this reviewer can t do that gabriel byrne struggles gamely with his likewise unlikeable character dermot mulroney only manages to look goofy in his puppydog idolization of fonda and poor anne bancroft tries to be the cold but caring mentor it s to fonda s credit that she manages to at least get us in her corner guiltily or not 
no good scenes in the whole movie this movie doesn t have a single scene worth watching femalien is in another league don t waste your time on the sequel 
widely acknowledged classic i hated it the movie is widely considered a classic for hong kong action movies leslie cheung is a fantastic actor and i enjoyed bridgitte lin very much in chungking express so even though i don t normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies i still decided to watch this movie i was extremely disappointed the cinematography is boring and poorly done the plot is juvenile it is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys i hated the movie however i fully understand that many many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important hk movies ever made 
the worst version of a christmas carel this was the only movie in the trilogy that i thought was clean enough to get a g rating they did not follow the story line from the last two films we meet a new villian belandona ambells evil sister who has manipulated carfaxce and his minnion killer to help here ruin christmas how careface got on earth when he supposed to be dead and be in hell is never covered they have a cheesy flash back when you find out why he became such a bad dog charlie is supposed to alive giving and second chance at the end of second film when he returned gabriels horn belandona is decent but not as evil as the other villians i have seen if on my top hundred villans list belandona is th in the top the st sauron the th naraku th malificent th cluney the th slagar the cruel the th tasarmina th badrang th golloum th team rocket tenth kagura i hardly recommend you don t she this movie it sucks even though it has a happy ended and carface goes good 
lame lame ! lame ! lame ! corny sexual humour no wonder it tanked if the amazon com thing is true because it s bad don t watch it unless you think e ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world 
kind of aimless i found this movie somewhat entertaining although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience nevertheless the film is about a whole host of young people dressed up and heading for a party ostensibly martha plimpton s party but they never quite make it there plimpton someone i never really cared for is actually rather funny in this role and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party and her idol elvis costello christina ricci and gaby hoffman are both quite funny courtney love paul rudd and janeane garofalo are also quite a trio overall this is light comedy nothing special but still worth the effort 
miserable acting horrible script inane directing what a mind numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror comedy of all time the re animator continuing in his deluded quest to claim the re animator series for his own and to convince us that he can direct producer brian yuzna has managed the opposite beyond re animator merely confirms what was evident about the yuzna directed bride of re animator that yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story as with dagon yuzna seems to have secured financing from spanish sources for this film unfortunately the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly spanish cast this is a story set in massachusetts for crying out loud why would the warden of the prison the reporter coming to cover the story the guards and a good per cent of the inmates all have spanish accents it wouldn t be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act but they can t simon andreu as warden brando and elsa pataky as love interest laura olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast but their acting is so bad and their adr afflicted lines so glaringly off that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes witness the gratuitous nurse nipple scene in this film or fabiana udenio and kathleen kinmont in bride of re animator and pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests i can remember but even pataky and andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery seething mass of bad acting that is leading man jason barry based on yuzna s shoddy history with actors one might be tempted to blame it on the director but the fact is that in this film jason barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment basic elementary acting his every internal and external beat rings false his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre most high school students do better than this jeffrey combs as herbert west seasoned pro that he is gamely plays along but the script puts west s character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit inducing pataky andreu axis that combs is unable to save this film on a strictly technical level the cinematography looks good the score is all right though often too serious minded for its own good and the film doesn t look low budget but when the story is such a mess and the actors so inept no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film yuzna really should stick with producing because on the stuart gordon directed dagon at least there were some good moments but beyond re animator is beyond salvaging possibly the worst film sequel i ve ever seen and way up there in the list of worst films i ve ever subjected myself to 
good book bad movie i loved the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first this movie is boring and did no justice to the book 
classic film but terrible video transfer this is a wonderful film some may say it s a bit slow paced and perhaps it s not geared for the mtv generation s pace of visual stimulation nonetheless patience has it s rewards for anyone who cares to take a chance it appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director tati unfortunately the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft as though the telecine was not in focus it s a crime that such a great film could not have been treated with greater care one only hopes that a dvd transfer of superior quality is in the pipes 
if only the movie would have followed the book this movie was awful that s all i can say about it it killed the book which happens to be one of my favorites when i got this movie after reading the book i excitedly stuck it in my vcr yes vcr no affordable dvd players at the time i was expecting so much more than what i received i know movies have to cut out a lot from the books to fit them into hours but i ve never before seen a movie cut out the main hero ! now that s just ridiculous ! if i were the author david baldacci i would be furious that my story had been so badly butchered clint eastwood had to be the star so he twisted the whole plot around to make luther whitney the hero when in the book luther whitney is gunned down half way though in the movie the book s hero jack graham is totally non existentmy advice to you if you re looking to buy a good movie look someplace else read the book sigh if only the movie would ve followed the book a little more closely it might have been a blockbuster hit too bad 
hollywood costume epic drama over substance this is another hollywood costume epic they spared no expense with the set and costumes hired talented big name actors rex harrison liz taylor and richard burton despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive harrison was terrific as gaius julius caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and richard burton does not come across as a great mark antony his character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by cleopatra antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked although the film is titled cleopatra it focuses more on the historic events the film also reduces cleopatra to the woman depicted in octavian s propaganda rather than portraying the real multi dimensional woman who was intelligent a gifted political strategist expert linguist dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty they don t give you sense of what was so compelling about cleopatra she is depicted as a combative shrew with both caesar and antony i doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man if you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here i would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as roman military leaders and the weak position of egypt compared to rome given the limitations of their vision of cleopatra liz taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish beautiful seductive and glamorous temptress she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can t deny taylor s appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material although taylor shines sadly we never get to know cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed hollywood costume drama this movie was lush eye candy without a whole lot of substance in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the s and sixties the style reminds me of demille films like the ten commandments it did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of taylor and burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit the research writing and the directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama the real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great 
great film lousy print it s difficult to figure why anybody would bother using a poor mm print to transfer to dvd when there must be good mm prints out there but this is another case of showcasing a very poor mm print otherwise this is an excellent madcap film but it doesn t start cooking until the edgar kennedy bartender scene and kennedy was absolutely masterful from this scene on the rest of the film is a romp there was much luck with the sequences with jacky the lion so sturges must have lived a charmed life all the performances shine 
nothing funny about it jack nicholson is wasted in this movie he doesn t get to be jack he just plays a watered down characature of himself but the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story sandler s character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff a reprisal but the point of the movie is that his character won t do it so you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff the movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage i chuckled at throwaway gags in the film the rest of the time i kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
feedback from real apache calculus wiz i saw a few scenes and couldn t even continue watching i like a lot of charles bronson s movies examples include death hunt the s death wish series and the white buffalo but his acting in this movie is unrealistic he does not act like a real apache bronson seems to overdo it on being stoic a relative and i watched a few scenes and just switched channels bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real apache paul newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an apache raised white man in hombre which i purchased on amazon i do applaud bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the s given the time period perhaps bronson should have hired roman gabriel instead he does a realistic job of portraying a cherokee indian in the undefeated which was also released around the same time give or take a couple of years 
the big sleep here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i couldn t believe what i was watching ! moreover i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating what is going on is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work hamfisted confusing screenplay and the cloying performance of modern cinema s most tedious and overratedsleep inducing actor ralph fiennes how i long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do entertain sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as the constant gardener it appears that we unfortunate real film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future 
jamie lee curtis must have been offered a ton of money to come back to the series at least i hope so pretending that never happened dont we all wish that this flea bag starts with ms curtis hiding out as the head mistress of a private school with a false name what kind of back ground check did they use on her and still living in fear of her brother michael well as you can guess he s back and still a little pissed off that she became a star and he has had to do all these bad sequels nothing new here and nothing worth seeing but at least we do get to see jamie and her late mother janet playing her pyscho role once again act together for what would be the last time just a waste of time but i hope it helped put ms curtis s daughter in collage as that is the only reason i can think of that would get her back into this mess 
oh the humanity red water a made for television film starring lou diamond phillips and kristy swanson carries on the now long and wearisome tradition of ripping off jaws you would think that nearly thirty years after steven spielberg s project arrived in theaters filmmakers and producers might move on to another genre you would be wrong every year brings us even more animal gone wild flicks everything from sharks octopi whales snakes bears rats ants birds cats dogs dinosaurs crocodiles alligators and genetic laboratory experiments gone horribly awry ripping their way through a fresh crop of hapless humans if the creature in question has sharp teeth claws wings talons tentacles and pincers expect to see the monster in question appear in a low budget straight to video knockoff of jaws sure there are elaborations to the standard plot lines none of which significantly improves these rip offs but all of them owe a big debt to steven spielberg s film for example red water tries something a little different by having a freshwater shark terrorize people on a louisiana river it also inserts a plot thread about a gang of criminals recovering a stash of money from the riverbed none of these ideas disguises what is really going on red water is the story of john sanders lou diamond phillips a down on his luck fisherman with an ex wife horrific memories of a disaster from his days as an oil drilling technician and loans on his boat he can t afford to repay at the same time sanders dithers with the bank about his delinquent loan payments a shark somehow manages to enter the river and promptly wreaks havoc on swimmers fishermen and anyone else who manages to get in the way sanders could care less about the shark primarily because he doesn t know about it at first and also because his ex wife kelli kristy swanson just walked back into his life she s a scientist working for some big oil company that is drilling for natural gas on the river and she knows that john is an expert on this sort of thing whether you buy the idea that a scientist would go by the name kelli is another matter sanders eventually agrees to help out when he learns that the oil executives will pay him handsomely for his troubles after all he ll do just about anything to bring in enough cash to keep his boat what none of these people know is that they will run headlong into several sharks one that swims and several that walk around on two legs the movie switches focus long enough to tell us about some jamaican criminal who lost a ton of money in the river when one of his underlings dropped the box containing the cash in the water while eluding the authorities this guy hires some mercenary thug along with a goon named ice coolio to go track down the subordinate in an effort to persuade him to reveal the location of the cash and wouldn t you know it the site just happens to lie right near the oilrig where sanders and kelli eventually show up ! what follows is incredibly predictable the criminals take over sanders s vessel because they think these guys angling for the money a disaster occurs on the rig that claims the lives of several workers and the shark turns up to chow down on a few of the principals how predictable is red water not only is there a cajun chap helping out on sanders s boat we get a few scenes of a cajun party complete with music and dancing just in case you aren t aware that you should laugh at these hicks the script throws in a few lines comparing the party to deliverance how clever and original is that i m starting to get real tired of seeing this sort of prejudice in films and television shows if you put any minority group in the place of these cajuns and did the same thing the outcry would be deafening its not the overt prejudice of the cajun scenes that sinks red water it s everything else the venerable lou diamond phillips hasn t made a good film since welli can t recall actually i quit following his career after the first power as for kristy swanson i was surprised to see her here i remember her star rising in the early to mid s but at some point she fell off the radar and if red water is any indication into b movie purgatory it s sad really because she s not that bad of an actress coolio on the other hand goes over the top in his role as a thug looking for some money if i had known from the start that this guy was in the film i wouldn t have watched it aside from the performances or the lack thereof the production values are low the pace drags and the film has the propensity to put the strangest dialogue in its characters mouths i really really wish i had written down some of the odd lines uttered by phillips s character i remember watching the movie and thinking at the time i should write that down and use it later in a review for some reason i didn t probably because i just wanted this thing to end quickly in another bizarre turn the movie carries a r rating even though there isn t much bloody carnage going on the only extras on the disc fortunately are trailers for bats the big hit and ride or die if you re really interested in watching creatures attack flicks there are plenty of other bad movies to choose from most of them unintentionally hilarious schlockfests that manage to entertain on some level red water is too bland too confused plot wise and too full of actors on the downhill slide of their careers to be entertaining if you decide to head up this river good luck to you 
basic director john mctiernancast john travolta connie nielsen samuel l jackson timothy daly giovanni ribisi brian van holt taye diggs dash mihok christian de la fuente roselyn sanchez harry connick jr running time minutesrated r for violence and language john mctiernan s the mastermind behind die hard basic opens up in a rain drenched panama jungle at night on an army training mission headed by sergeant west samuel l jackson flash forward to the next day an army chopper picks up two men from the training mission one injured and one very much alive the injured man kendall giovanni ribisi is sent to a hospital and the alive man dunbar brian van holt is sent in for questioning by the very sexy and very southern osborne connie nielsen dunbar refuses to speak to anyone except a ranger so in comes ranger tom hardy john travolta to piece together the events surrounding the death of sgt west and his team most of the film takes place at night during a rainy hurricane and adds to the nonexistent plot what is so intriguing is that the plot isn t really there but the writer tries to manifest one and we feel as if we are staring at some nonexistant material wad of words and flashbacks and images thrown together in a blender the writer hoping for it to come out smelling of roses the writer of basic james vanderbilt whose screen crudentials consist of darkness falls has so many twists and turns that the film is impossible to keep up with it becomes hard to seperate present from past and what s real from what s not so many revelations happen that the audience will feel they are in the middle of the writer s mind as he comes up with new ideas and tries to squeeze them in time after time after time there is a limit to how many times you can use surprise revelation endings vanderbilt uses three of four in a row piled on top of each other time after time after time just as we think the plot twists are done and we start to smile because we think we might finally understand the basis of the plot something else happens and we zoom in suspensefully on john travolta s face as he along with the audience realizes something the performances of basic s cast are a mixed bag travolta is watchable as usual and he brings a believable sense of self assured cool to hardy but he is frustratingly unable to contain his hammy instincts the quality of a travolta performance appears to be inversely proportional to the volume of his voice when he s quiet he s very good when he yells he quickly becomes a cartoon this movie has enough credibility problems it doesn t need a cartoon hero if travolta is mixed news connie nielsen is plain bad it s not so much that she can t seem to make heads or tails of the convoluted story heck no one can but she seems less to be stymied than just exceptionally stupid the scenes that are supposed to establish romantic tension between her and travolta fall laughably flat to top it off she is saddled with some hollywood nimrod s notion of a southern accent which blinks on and off like a turn signal the smaller roles though fare much better van holt as the prisoner does especially well flavoring his defiance with feral intelligence there is also nice work by taye diggs as the unit s misfit and tim daly where has he been since wings folded as the base commander the most memorable though and you sort of knew this already is jackson he has the lunatic drill instructor bit down pat and delivers it with relish his is the one character in basic who is supposed to be larger than life in part because he is seen in flashback which means that we are seeing not the man himself but other people s impressions of him in his commando sweater and poncho thrown over one shoulder like a warlord s cape he looks twenty feet tall and invincible still one of jackson s great talents is his ability to project nuance and smarts to even the most unsubtle characters his sgt west is the shadow leaning over the whole incident and the movie would have been smart to take more advantage of that the real disappointment in the supporting cast is the normally talented giovanni ribisi as the wounded survivor a hospital ward weirdo who is supposed to seem mysterious but mostly comes off as jokey and annoying ribisi seems to have shoplifted his performance from gary oldman in hannibal down to his marble mouthed line deliveries though basic is shabbily conceived it is at least presented well by john mctiernan who manages to wring what tension may be had from the loopy script the movie is lacking in the action set pieces mctiernan usually employs but he nails the atmosphere just right the use of weather to convey emotion is certainly overdone but it is still effective when done right as it is here the pounding ever present rain and the dim shadow tinged interior lighting gives the movie the feel of an approaching end a kind of despairing resignation to horrible things it s a shame that the drama can t keep up with its own visual metaphor it has its merits but strains your suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point and washes its credibility away like bloodstains in a rainstorm 
not pialat s strongest picture i don t know whether seinfeld creator larry david had a nos amours in mind for the mock eurotrash film that appears in repeated episodes rochelle rochelle there are so many french films that could be described as a young girl s strange erotic journey from milan to minsk the sexual activities awakenings of pretty young teenagers is somewhat of a national obsession it s hard to pick just one maurice pialat is widely known as the french cassavetes or if you are british the french ken loach which is the shorthand way of saying he s french made films on the fringe of the european studio system imbued his pictures with unsentimental realism and is well liked by film snobs who see pialat s lack of relative mainstream success on these shores as proof of their sophisticated taste his feature length debut l enfance nue was tendered the francois truffaut mark of approval it was produced by the master as well as a prix jean figo that award is given each year to a promising french director generally a young one though pialat was a forty four when he got his he cemented his reputation as un auteur with s sous le soleil de satan which not only won him the palme d or but iconoclast status for life when he flipped off some booing audience members while accepting it sounds like a guy i could like if only a nos amours were a better film the picture stars sixteen yearold sandrine bonnaire as the frequently nude not as titillating as it sounds suzanne a confused french teenager wandering from one hollow sexual encounter to the next she says she s only happy when she s in the arms of one of her paramours and we don t blame her suzanne s home life is at best unusual at worst fairly grotesque dad played by pialat himself flies the coop early on leaving his son pudgy tyrant robert dominique besnehard in charge of both daughter and half crazy mom evelyne ker emotional and physical abuse relents only for short passages of awkward conversation often hinging on some sort of inappropriately sexual subject that tinges everything in something akin to unconsummated incest mom calls daughter a slut who trades sex advice with dad while fielding interminable compliments about her body from her brother who himself has become a surrogate husband to mom everyone in this family suzanne included seeks to make life miserable for everyone else and in their own creepy ways they succeed plenty of women seek the affections of too many men or too many of the wrong men to compensate for an absent father such are the incontrovertible facts that clich is made of it s the sort of unsophisticated platitude masqueradingaswisdom we ve come to expect from daytime talk shows peddled to prostitutes and cheating spouses in his own quasi verit manner i imagine pialat was seeking to subvert the clich deconstruct it transcend it rarely does it actually come off the meandering quarrels beatings and post coital chit chats all have the feel of work shopping actors being put through an exercise rather than real life even the life of a sexually obsessed french person pialat never truly gets under the surface of these characters frquently mistaking the bizarre and cruel for honest characterization its no surprise catherine breillat is such a fan of a the picture one hundred minutes pass and yet we still feel as though we do not know these characters they remain only our acquaintances obnoxious ones at that and if it s all the same we rather wish we hadn t been introduced interesting footnote one of suzanne s first sexual conquests is an american tourist we meet him as his has an argument with some french sailors whom he calls warmongers this is probably the only time in cinema you will see an american character call a french one a warmonger 
i turned it off half way through michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through the big one i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i didn t know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick this is not one of his better films 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
mortal kombat i did not receive this movie and i was charge for iti would look to receive the dvdthank youcan someone email me with this inforossannemccullough hotmailcomor call me at my name is rossanne mcculloug 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download 
a note to subtitle caption users given that this film stars a deaf actress and that i had seen this movie on lifetime tv with captioning i had no reason to suspect that the dvd would come without captions as a deaf viewer i was severely disappointed in this product the film itself is good entertainment but what s there to enjoy if you can t understand the dialogue 
can t rate what i can t see brannagh s film version of hamlet blows away every other version as well as every other shakespeare based film it s an easy stars now the dvd is a different matter been hearing about and waiting for this for ages ! every lame oh shlock film holywood cranks out shows up on dvd and usually big projects like this are milked for every they can get with fancy packaging and special editions i was part of the project through which a small determined group of fans was able to bring the one season wonder my so called life to dvd and there must be close to as large an audience for this where is it 
the horror ! the horror well i had to succumb i was attracted to this alleged film by it s notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad my low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded this film reaches new cinematic depths it s complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of plan from outer space it s stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they re just desperate tom green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence ever ! i felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like rip torn and julie hagerty who signed onto this dross but hey they cashed the checks watching a few minutes of this slop is painful enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic to get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness i m going to have to watch an actual good movie like showgirls 
not as good as it sounds i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here so i was upset when i watched this sad movie gary graham tv s alien nation is a robot jox which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought ! the f x are not very good and the story is paper thin only the acting is good but it can t save this one from being just a let down skip it 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
drags on and on this account of the life and love affair of henry miller and anais nin seems endless the director attempts to show character traits and development via an endless parade of sexual liaisons which becomes more than tedious after the first hour and a half of the movie henry june and anais deserve better 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
terrible and embarrassing jerry jenkins ought to be ashamed he states in an interview on this dvd that he started a movie company because he thought this was such a good story that it needed to be told first and foremost it s a terrible movie christian or secular it s just plain bad the script stinks the characters are unlikable and weak the directing and editing is high school quality and most of the acting is pathetic as for it being a christian movie you ve got to be kidding me why because there s no cussing is that what makes it christian the gospel is not portrayed in any way shape or form in fact the way i see it it s unbiblical we even have the main character who doesn t really profess to be a christian but since she mentions god we assume that she must be in fact jesus is never mentioned in the movie she ends up dating an openly unbelieving boy is that the christian message we want to send our kids from now on if jerry jerkin s name is on a movie i m not watching it this movie robbed two hours of my life i ll never get back if you want to see a family movie buy a classic made in the s or s 
as a lover of van gogh i did not care for this movie jacques dutronc was great it was the directing and the portrayal of van gogh that i thought was inaccurate this movie is only based on the last days of van gogh s life perhaps i would have enjoyed it more if we could have watched how van gogh evolved what was he like during the ten years before his death i d like to see a movie that can depict more of the essence of van gogh and not only focus on quotthe worst days of his life quot there is a huge misconception in the world of who van gogh quotisquot and this movie only feeds it read quotdear theo quot van gogh s letters to his brother theo the book is far much better than this movie at least we can get the truth through van gogh s eyes not maurice pialat s 
better not shown i imagine this movie might be funny if you re really into dog shows i m not so i couldn t tell you mediocre at best this is spinal tap was better 
attempts to be provokative turns out ultra violent gore the ideas behind minutes aren t bad at all take one robert deniro put him in new york mix him with some american dream hunting eastern europeans on a killing spree and try to provoke some emotions and have a sly dig at the american justice system lets see nothing happened only repulse if like everyone else you plan on watching this film because deniro is in it you will be dissapointed he puts in a tired performance almost as if he knows the film is a load of b s the attempt to be hard hitting goes horribly wrong instead it s just repulsive over the top violence and its pointless naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces why there are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning such as mm the horrible subject of snuff movies hard hitting meaningfull film minutes is far from meaningfull we all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that but when converting it to a film it needs a deeper meaning otherwise it turns into melodramatic hollywood if you like brain dead gore and violence lack of plot and cringing melodrama go ahead 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd

you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer 
just not gripping admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it s moments of entertainment but overall it s long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this didn t do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman s silent scientific discoveries completely amusing couldn t wait for the movie to end honestly 
stars for carly carly simon s the only one worth watching on this dvd but she s only in the film for seconds and her only line is i read that sh t you wrote about me and thats what this movie i 
misleading search results i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed incorrectly as there is no shania performance on the dvd as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal sorry !

mortal kombat annihilated such a sad sequel to the best video game movie mortal kombat anilhilation was anihilated the day it was made the story was poorly done i didn t like how the characters act in this film jax williams acts like a afician american stereotype sonya hess acts like a weak little bitch sindel vander acts like one of those pathetic villianess you see in those direct tovideo films that have dumb villianess and brian thompson should be a shame of himself such a good character actor playing a pethetic shao khan one thing that sucks in this film is that radien remar and shao kahn are brothers and shinnok schore is their father what a pathetic change to add in this film raiden and kahn are far from family and shinnok and kahn don t even like each other and they re not father and son in the game this film cost million yet the special effects in this film look so cartoony in fact i ve seen playstation one graphics look better than that this film is really bland and john r leonetti directing style sucks if you wanna watch a sequel to mortal kombat just watch yourself playing mortal kombat on midway s arcade greatest hits on playstation and xbox

my own personal hell this is the first time i delved into the hellraiser series and i have to admit i kind of regret it the film opens with a collage of disturbing images i guess to get my attention but there is no real reason for them to be there from there the film falls into a freefall where it jumps from one messed up scene to the next it all looks perfectly twisted but who really cares clive barker as he did in night breed shows his taste for creative costumes and set designs of course they are all very self indulgent but beautiful nonetheless in their own little way had this film showed up at a modern art museum i would have labeled it pretentious but since it showed up in movie theaters i have no choice but to label it crap i would love to describe the plot to you but it didn t make a ton of sense to me kirsty ashley laurence is in a mental hospital and is convinced that her dad is calling out to her from inside hell and thus she must go save him meanwhile her evil step mom and speaking from experience they are all evil is reemerging from hell with the distinct disadvantage of not having any skin upon her return she uses her bloody pulp of a body to engage in a sexual act with another evil doer i m sure that gets laughs every time from the children who are watching but to me it was silly and unnecessary she goes on a quest for skin which goes off without a hitch and from there a battle ensues between kirsty and her step mom over the soul of a little girl named tiffany or so everybody calls her the whole point seems to be that our minds make up our own personal hells and that is an idea i can get on board with one overview shot of hell has it looking strikingly similar to an m c escher print with dead ends and trap doors and boogeymen we all travel through the labyrinth of our mind on a daily basis but i cannot get on board with this film it is sensational for the sake of sensationalism which is fine with me but not when it is mixed with a brain dead plot what do i or anybody for that matter get from watching a man carve himself up with a knife i guess that at least it is not soft like modern horror movies but this one does not earn its gore for those of you who demand nothing out of your movies other than the experience of a bad dream where nothing makes sense then this is your film for the rest of you this is failed storytelling of the highest degree i still have hellraiser on my shelf to watch and i must say it won t be hard for that one to top this mess i may never understand why people think atmosphere is enough to create a scary movie it is the major flaw of this film and japanese horror in general but i want a story to go with my scares what this one is selling is a chance to be grossed out of your mind or bored stiff or both i hated this movie and no i don t care how realistic it looked when the characters were peeling the skin off of their faces 
not for dvd aficionados i m rather upset with the technical quality of this dvd grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in without so much as a x animorphic upgrade this is certainly not worth the dollar price tag amazon com has right now 
its official brad pitt cannot act ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a cult classic isnt that what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch or underated theres a reason it was underated it sucks brad pitts performance was laughable watch any episode of gunsmoke and tell me early gracewasnt a bad impersonation of festus from start to finish and that guy from the x files david sumthin or other mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film this guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand and juliet lewis playing a yet another brain dead bimbo who woulda saw that one coming the only reason i gave this one stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat i think its called morbid fascination like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident it repulses you but you just cant turn away if you want my advice and you probably dont take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a gunsmoke dvd that way you get festus and you get to watch matt dillon beat the h outta somebody 
the lisbon suicides therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages and cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood s boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room on the second floor of a two story house and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon s neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run ofthemill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she s not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip s request knowing nothing but trip s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick of course but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
dark shadows i give this a star because its on vhs tape until theres a restored dvd copy i will have to copy my tapes to dvd that i have picture not the best better then nothing the price on the tapes you have gett real iam not paying that price unless its on dvd better tell dan curtis to get on the stick and give good dvd copy of it to u 
americo trash this is the dumbest most predictable horrible waste of time i ve ever ever seen this movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn t it took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that s supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe drink and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us after watching this movie i felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash my only hope is that our european friends didn t seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
not worth seeing george segal is a good actor but he is out of his element in this type of movie he is much better in light hearted movies like fun with dick and jane the biggest disappointment is the dialog by harold pinter the characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens and we all get bored this spy movie is not even in the same league with day of the jackel and the odessa file i threw away my copy of the quiller memorandum after watching it once i can t imagine ever wanting to see it again 
die gd it die ! die thus with the quote from the film above goes the movie shark attack all of the negative feedback about this film is true rather than go on about what has been stated well already though here are what i believe are the most memorable lines that make this film uber cliched youre extinct f er my lawyers will have a field day with you they are the real sharks im really wired so why don t i take you home and eat your after destroying the megalodon megalawho laughter hey where are the cocktails this is the kind of dialogue you can expect from the film these are the highlights of course i am not pointing out all the excellent grunting and roaring that the sharks expel but i don t want to give everything away well one more thing audiences find out that boats are commonplace within a prehistoric shark s diet why would you dear viewer want to watch this 
complicated with pointless storylines i was tod to watch this film from a co worker and i was jsut dissapointed i could not believe i wasted almost hours watching this trash the story was very confusing with it going back and fourth through time there are many pointless storylines and charactors the acting is overdone that it s not believable i like the actors in the film but they where jsit placed in the wrong movie 
moronic view of the lack of life of an angel i learned long ago to ignore and laugh at the positive and negative feedback that a reviewer gets obviously my one star review of this movie will get negative feedback but that doesn t make my opinion any less valid it is after all my honest opinion and therefore it is worth something to someone if only to me sometimes i agree with ebert and sometimes i completely disagree with him i think we all believe in our hearts that i am the only one with the correct opinion i would subscribe to that myself this movie is painfully slow and boring wim wenders next time maybe you will develop a story line please huh i really hate the premise that the only way an angel s life can be fulfilling is if he becomes human that is the moral here and also in the annoying movie city of angels that s absurd assuming that there is life after death assuming that there are angels and i in no way discount that possibility because i know how little we truly know it is absurd to think that the angels have nothing to do but watch over us and wish they were with us that is offensively stupid and self centered it is like a child s point of view that mommy and daddy have absolutely nothing to do and are bored to tears when they are not watching the baby and coloring in the baby s coloring book so this conception of angels is in my not at all humble opinion stupid and offensive what makes you think that we humans are the center of the universe and the only worthwhile thing that is going on dingbat stupid premise and boring story if you want to call it a story at all i can t keep watching it it is still on right now and i m writing this review to relieve the boredom later after seeing the end of the movie i must add that the final monologue committed by the angel s human girlfriend is probably the worst monologue i have ever seen on film she goes on and on saying nothing in a stupid and self indulgent elongated bit of nonsense that is surreal meaningless and stupid the only thing that this movie has going for it is that it makes people appreciate simple things about life like warming your hands together on a cold day that s a nice and worthwhile thought to appreciate the very little and insignificant things about life aside from that bit of wisdom this movie is poor boring full of itself aimless and overrated 
heartburn or men beware ! most women only want to breed this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own self worth is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl s movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant quothomemakerquot if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too 
great acting but unbelievable story line this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting especially the girls playing christy and ariel is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but couldn t he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but can t find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i can t imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter s eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed 
cheeze corn i remember seeing children of the corn right after reading stephen king s short story version in his classic book night shift i was excited because king s story was such good scary fun well i watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was while the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze king s story was short like pages and sweet w sinister children and a mysterious god monster in the cornfields the movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye rolling and laughter the running time is minutes including about an hour s worth of padding cotc would have made an excellent addition to one of king s anthology movies like creepshow as it stands it s bloated and pretty boring of course linda hamilton is in it which is why i gave it an extra star 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
just not gripping admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it s moments of entertainment but overall it s long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this didn t do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman s silent scientific discoveries completely amusing couldn t wait for the movie to end honestly 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha 
not very interesting maybe i m just too picky because i m fond of the quality of recent bbc films i did not think much of this movie pseudoartsy in my opinion very drab and plotless the characters are flat and boring honestly i can t believe i watched the whole movie 
worst acting ever i turned this movie on one morning and was glued to it for mins because i just knew it was a joke ! whm spoke as if he were on an infomercial and the actress who played the student was no better knowing now that it was based on a play makes perfect sence plays hardly ever translate to good films ! the acting in a play is just totally different overly dramatic not believable sorry i hate to write a review based on mins in the middle of a movie but i purposely researched the title of this one so i could warn others off no actually do watch it ! i want you to see for yourself how awful it is and i like w h macy

what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
sum of all stars zero maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat on top of that the acting was horrible this movie didn t take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor 
disappointing i was expecting much more from this video it did have kids doing poses but it was hard to find the year old some of the circle games looked like they might be fun i wanted to show it to my third grade class but i don t think it would hold their interest all in all i felt i was watching someone s home video of their family doing yoga 
take it off the rack and it s wack put it back i don t know what s up with all of these star reviews this movie was awful there was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag not even the guest appearances by afrika bambataa melle mel and the rock steady crew could save it i couldn t wait for it to be over with the graffiti throughout the movie was absolutely awful ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair guy davis was fine back then but not anymore rae dawn chong was just annoying this is one movie i never want to see again 
the worst film of all time artie may well be a baby gorilla but the film sucks 
low class low budget and low on titillation a pointless women inchains howler now on dvd the title pretty much lets you know what you re getting it s a grade c howler but not as blatantly funny as i was hoping directed by exploitation film specialist eddie romero from a story that originally came from jonathan demme long before directing silence of the lambs and philadelphia this low budget action movie was obviously filmed in the philippines but set in some anonymous third world country playing hooker and small time drug dealer lee daniels blaxploitation superstar pam grier plays the first half of the title role while long forgotten margaret markov is the other half karen brent an unlikely patty hearst like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government naturally antagonistic toward each other they are in a women s prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini skirts as uniforms run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half hearted cat fighting as lee and karen are pitted against each other of course they escape but shackled together a la the defiant ones and continue the cat fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits meanwhile various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit the loutish drug lord looking for lee who stole k from him the rather passive revolutionaries looking for karen and the incompetent police who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord needless to say everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of filipino women a dog wears karen s panties and some of the worst of s men s fashion one beer bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face there is a rather sad ending but what s truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise sadly grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the jive while markov is an amazonian blonde whom i am convinced is trying desperately to be credible since no one displays any talent for acting the rest of the cast is not worth noting except balding bug eyed sid haig who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord the dvd contains only the original trailer as an extra

no title what a disappointment ! i remember siskel and ebert raving over this romantic comedy romantic maybe but comedy never very predictable plot from beginning to end and rosie perez was truly offensive a few times i couldn t understand what she was saying there is no way i could buy that she and cage s character were attracted to each other maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex violence or rough language although cage does get shot in one hold up scene it was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way i am beginning to like cage more and more as he ages spoiler i was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners either they shouldn t have changed it so much or they shouldn t have let us know about the real story it was based on end of spoiler but fonda and cage were very engaging together 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
dismayingly bad it s not just that if lucy fell is a bad film of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer directorstar eric schaeffer s nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday s roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he s cute speaks volumes 
this is where it all started it should have ended here too this is a terrible terrible film it s incredibly boring lame tedious filled with bad acting bad direction etc etc i know it was very popular at the time but it still is really awful i had a difficult time sitting through the whole thing and it was rather sleep inducing i wanted to see at least one of the friday the th films so i watched this one many of the murders were ripped off from mario bava s superior twitch of the death nerve aka bay of blood so the film wasn t even that original as we know there were roughly around sequels tv shows jason dolls jason s official murder tools jason s hockey mask etc etc the film was one of the biggest hits of the year hollywood started to decline coincidence who knows i just know i wasted minutes of my time 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
don t bother i got this dvd for and i still feel ripped off the quality of the movie was terrible the story line was stupid and the acting was just fair do not waste your time on this poor movie even though there are some stars in it in their younger days eloitt gould michelle piefer david caruso it does not make up for the poor content of the movie cheaply made dont bother ! 
the adventure of sherlock holmes smarter brother if you re a real sherlock holmes fan this is not the movie you want to see ! it s pretty dumb and not worth watching again 
this is a comedy seriously i didn t even think that this was a comedy until i came here and saw people saying it wasn t funny i got it as part of a boxed set of cary grant films purchased here and it s the only dud of the lot there was one scene that i will grant you was light and entertaining not laugh out loud but funny enough i won t spoil it by saying which one aside from that the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity most of all you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne grant and simmons in particular are strong but their efforts are ultimately squandered bob mitchum is ok but generally miscast and kerr s beauty and talent are basically wasted no amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here she goes from happily married to tramp in about minutes for no discernible reason overall acting c grantsimmons b directing fwriting d i understand that this film caters more to english tastes and that s fine but i found it most un satisfying 
boooriiiiiing i want the two hours of my life back after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in that time is past even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your s and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated ! 
should have been made in america this film was very confusing and boring the dark tone of the scenery was depressing hard to follow i really think this should have been either colorful for an audience of children or more graphic for an adult audience it s almost like the director wasen t sure which audience he wanted to please and doing so didn t please either one skip it

do the right thing avoid this movie i would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible i would say it is self important immature obvious and overwhelmingly one sided it seems spike lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid racist phony or downright evil i had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music then minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words lee had his moments but it was pretty much a hour music video spike lee doesn t mess with fantasy only with reality and his reality is black and white it is infact fantasy and pure propaganda 
the worst version of a christmas carel this was the only movie in the trilogy that i thought was clean enough to get a g rating they did not follow the story line from the last two films we meet a new villian belandona ambells evil sister who has manipulated carfaxce and his minnion killer to help here ruin christmas how careface got on earth when he supposed to be dead and be in hell is never covered they have a cheesy flash back when you find out why he became such a bad dog charlie is supposed to alive giving and second chance at the end of second film when he returned gabriels horn belandona is decent but not as evil as the other villians i have seen if on my top hundred villans list belandona is th in the top the st sauron the th naraku th malificent th cluney the th slagar the cruel the th tasarmina th badrang th golloum th team rocket tenth kagura i hardly recommend you don t she this movie it sucks even though it has a happy ended and carface goes good 
why are you goggling at me the soviet film days before the command is the tale of the fate of a handful of raw young recruits who attempt to retain their humanity in a bleak senseless brutal militaristic culture the film blends moments of brutality a drunken officer returning at night and urinating on the face of a sleeping recruit for example with endless nude scenes the director hussein erkenov states that the inclusion of nudity was a deliberate action aimed to show the recruits vulnerability and innocence well i can buy that i suppose the naked shower scenes the sprawled tangled half naked bodies in the abandoned woodshed and the prolonged soapy rub downs etc do invoke a certain ethereal lost boys quality think hylas and the nymphs but the nymphs are all male however after wrestling with the possibility that perhaps this film wasn t set in a basic training camp for recruits after all but instead was perhaps a nudist colony i was still left with a dull feature sparse dialogue and quixotic editing in russian with english subtitles displacedhuma 
the nadir of corman s shining collection peter lorre s the black cat is charmingly done yetthe other two are stinkers im a corman fan but this was boring and silly to watch i think they had a good idea bringing the trilogy it to the big screen butthis version and interpretation of poe s masterpieces didn t translate well at all so beware of the dog 
who would want to kill the sweetest woman in the world i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why don t you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichd rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i hadn t forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was fast furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he s a refugee from the outsiders but the movie s not a total wash after all it s got a great soundtrack 
was expecting much more i enjoy watching teen movies because i m ever so curious about how the director sees this particular age group and the misconceptions present in his view as much as in the teens view of things this movie is unlike most teen romantic comedies i ve seen and not necessarily in a good way first of all the main characters are unlikeable and don t represent actual categories of people in real life we have the good looking rebel who s actually not so rebellious after all but then gets back to his old ways stupid twist if you ask me the nerd who can t get any they picked the worst possible guy to play the nerd he s actually pretty good looking and a funny guy the nerdy girl who hasn t grown up yet ends up hooking up with the rebel but they break up the gay guy i have no idea what his role in this movie was the aggressive victim of child abuse the freaky nympho with a tint of lesbian what the hell were you thinking daniel waters and finally the rebel s childhood best friend who falls in love with him and is rejected the film focuses about minutes of its total on this character i don t know why she s even here she has no obvious role and her situation doesn t reflect at all in the real world next up i think the director is sexually obsessed or something ok i know sex is an important part of a teenager s life but this movie is about lame year old girls aching for sex and even lamer year olds who have nothing else better to do if i wanted to see hormonal imbalance i would go watch discovery channel there are more important things in life than sex and this masterpiece definitely doesn t illustrate them the characters thoughts and actions are limited to the camp itself and the director focuses too much on useless stuff and tries to create stereotypes but fails miserably most teen movies have a moral side to them they teach the audience certain values unlike happy campers this movie only taught me that it s so cool to be obsessed about sex it s cool for year old girls to think they re oh sohot women that only the absolute best looking guys hook up not true in the real world and more also the director makes completely ridiculous situations seem normal such as the camp leader getting hit by lightning and then acting completely weird the counsellors buying boxes of condoms theres only so much sex you can have in days the whole donttouchme todd thing and so on and so forth this movie isn t worth the i paid to rent it those who think this is better than the american pie series should go out more american pie was a work of art this is a piece of 
a big bomb and a stinker for tom cruise this movie is nearly hours of hot air as bad as the movie the hindenburg ! if george c scott saw this movie he would be rolling over in his grave ! i yawned so much that i got a charley horse in my neck and nearly had a stroke from being bored to tears ! saddam hussein should be strapped in a chair and be forced to watch this movie maybe then would he confess of his atrocities that he committed ! stay as far and away from this movie as you can !

wasting space on my dvd shelf i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college and because he spoke so highly of it i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it i definitely regret that decision if you re thinking of buying it rent it first it was dull and obnoxious not to mention weird the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate which is why i gave it star instead of however if you re still interested definitely rent it you might enjoy it 
the story of jane the title character does not get much screen time in this film he doesn t even get any lines most of his yells are done so that you can t see his mouth this is really the story of jane jane has decided to go to africa to search for her father who left her and her mother many years before on the way she must defend her virtue kill the crew of the boat she hired and pilot the boat to her father there she finds a man who seems to have had his brains baked in the sun a little too long eventually they all go off to search an escarpment to find the elephant s graveyard once on top they find the giant inland sea and a bizarre tribe living near the graveyard we only see one dead elephant so at the time i did not know the graveyard had been found they also run into tarzan who has the habit of not speaking and passing out whenever he exerts himself i really got the feeling that the only thing any of the film s creators knew about tarzan was what they had learned from johnny weissmuller films the escarpment seems to be about half the continent it is nearly impossible to climb so i don t know how dying elephants manage to get up it jane s experiences with the bizarre tribe where she gets painted white seem to have been lifted from ursula andress s film slave of the cannibal god there is very little that is right with this film other than that it does finally end jane goes from super able to a frightened schoolgirl but eventually falls for tarzan and reconciles with her father but in the end it is not really worth watching for viewers who are hoping to see bo derek nude almost all of that is found during the closing credits so you might as well just skip right to them 
creepy disgusting script harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals and her bright friend s big plan is to set off a smoke bomb incendiary during a school assembly either one will get a kid expelled arrested and in the newspapers not amusing ! then there s golly telling her about the virtues of lying if there is a lesson that could be drawn which the movie misses harriet s secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing because she is showing the sort of behavior that in a kid years older would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self mutilation or bulemia as in the movie thirteen

worset movie ever i can t stand this movie it s one of the worset the acting is horrible it s dark gloomy and so boring its fun to watch and make fun of it but thats about all i do not recommend it i would give it zero stars if it was possible the child actress mary and then the older grown up mary actress isn t suitable she doesn t even look like she could have been the same person or type how awful watch another version this one is a waste of time and money ! 
see arthur lake as an elevator boy and a bellhop cary grant and constance bennett go out for a drive when suddenly a tire blows out and they go off the side of the road when they come to they both realize they individually have turned into a ghost they decide to cause all kinds of havoc with the people around them billie burke is in this film two years later she played the good witch the one who appeared in the big pink bubble in the wizard of oz hedda hopper who spoke of celebrity gossip on radio and newsreel plays quotmrs stuyvestant quot arthur lake has funny scenes as a nervous elevator boy and then later as a bellhop the next year arthur lake became quotdagwood bumstead quot and played that character for the next years in the quotblondiequot film series from this was the first film to be computer colorized a horrible technique that was used in the s this was not restoration the computer only had pale colors such as yellow brown green pink light blue light green the computer would chase the colors onto an item or person this is why you see the flesh tone of someones face moving around which may not be the true flesh tone of the actor it is like putting tinted plastic wrap on the screen itself computer colorization did improved somewhat with other black amp white films and some are quite watchable there is more interest and detail in watching a computer colorized film that was originally black amp white however let me make something perfectly clear when you see on vhs or dvd that a film has been restored and digitally remastered that is a different process that means the actual negetive or master of the film has been carefully restored to its original deep rich colors and brightness the film has been preserved for many more years all scratches and pops are gone but to get back to this version of topper this is only the computer colorized version that i have written this review for 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
free to be you and me as long as you are like me i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my s days in elementary school this video made its rounds in the public schools the songs are catchy and the film quality is good but make no mistake this is propaganda aimed at children i will not be showing it to my kids despite the freewheeling title the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys case in point atalanta a princess finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world on her father s horse she also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of ladies first the tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron the narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal our hosts infant puppets voiced by mel brooks and marlo thomas are revolting there should be a law against using mel brooks voice for a baby apparently i repressed memories of these creatures but seeing them again brought back the horror needless to say i fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry overall this dvd is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
disappointing first of all for the caliber of actors in this movie they deserved a better script michelle pfeifer and peter gallagher are class acts but really this movie just did not dig deep enough i have read all the rave reviews of claire danes as i have read all the raves in the past and i am beside myself i mean she has mastered the part of the proverbial angst ridden pouting teenager to a tee if this is her niche so be it the premise of the story is pretty decent a man loses his wife in a tragic freak accident and has a hard time moving on completely understandable then his annoying sister in law and her equally annoying husband arrive and proceed to berate the poor guy for mooning over a wife that is dead oh my god stop the presses these people had the sensitivity of androids it would have been nice to see him kick these people out of the house but then the film would nt drone on and on this is a good film for a rainy day but i expected more 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time this movie is so disjointed that you watch it hoping to understand what s going on brad pitt who i think is great walked through his role what there was of it kate blanchard was the heroin that you couldn t like everyone else in the movie did what you would expect them to do no orginality i flat cannot recommend this movie to anyone academy awards aside 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
eh ive seen worse if you want a review of the plot itself complete with spoilers feel free to read the other reviews my biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed again and again due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn t keep the story straight there is a homage to asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm that would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film there are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible that said it was a bit enjoyable the cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given if the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked maybe i would have cared what happened to them the dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say oooh cool good premise good effects good acting but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film 
wild orchaid this movie was not good at all other than it has beautiful people with real nice bodies everything else is a waste of money and time 
a big bomb and a stinker for tom cruise this movie is nearly hours of hot air as bad as the movie the hindenburg ! if george c scott saw this movie he would be rolling over in his grave ! i yawned so much that i got a charley horse in my neck and nearly had a stroke from being bored to tears ! saddam hussein should be strapped in a chair and be forced to watch this movie maybe then would he confess of his atrocities that he committed ! stay as far and away from this movie as you can !

don t bother with this one first of all i m a sherlock holmes fan and have a hard time with some of the parodies i am also a big fan of gene wilder madeline kahn and marty feldman the three stars in this film these three were great in mel brook s young frankenstein which is one of the all time best parodies they fall flat on this film and i would not waste my time a definite no no 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
why what s the point there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i don t need to add anything in that regard but what on earth does a lesbian sub story in both regards have to do with the story as a whole nothing so we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue grass music and the appalachian way of life that instead heads for the trash bin 
hmm this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives it portrays reality how they want to see it its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
terrible acting plot and everything is so bad that it made me cry dragonheart was breathtaking this is bs worst acting and story i ever saw in a movi 
a girl dancer has to be exotic she has to be a peach i realize that many may love this film for the impressive sounds that both fred astaire and judy garland create together i must admit there was quite a bit of singing and dancing to demonstrate this karmic connection that these two had together honestly i would like to admit that there was just a bit too much singing and dancing in this film easter parade was nothing except a showcase that allowed astaire to prove himself to audiences again and again while garland attempt to counter her wizard of oz persona that followed her until her bittersweet end musicals are a tough genre to create you as a director need to have a concrete balance between the song dance routines and the physical plot which keeps the audience watching until the very end i have seen musicals fail and succeed because the director had that bond secured sadly easter parade s director charles walters did not have a strong enough grip on the two instead of a good story with emotional characters and a sincere plot we are forced to watch garland and astaire seemingly attempt to continually outdo themselves on screen there was no chemistry between the two there was no logical plot to this story and finally there was no emotion i cared nothing for anyone in these performances because i was bombasted time and time again with dance song and meaningless clichs which seemed to be the overall theme of this film judy garland and fred astaire fans out there are not going to enjoy what i am about to say this being my first fred astaire picture watched i must admit i was not impressed astaire did nothing to develop his character throughout the film while i do agree that it is the job of the director to create these lines astaire should have done something instead of prance around hoping to carry this film on just the weight of his tappy feet as i watched easter parade i couldn t help but think of astaire as this manipulator towards his own common good i saw him as this evil man who wanted nothing more than to be successfully but was not willing to do it on his own from the opening scenes in this film where it is obvious that he loves the camera on him to the moments where he is on stage proving that he is the top dog in dance and song perhaps i misread this film but i saw astaire as this guy who had relationship issues he wasn t interested in actually falling in love but didn t want to loose his partner again his character don was determined to be the best in the business and he didn t care whom he was partnered with which allowed him to reach that goal you could see that when he showed minimal emotion towards nadine when they parted and how unemotional he because during all of his scenes with garland there was absolutely no chemistry between these two actors i believe the age difference to be the biggest hurdle but the fact that when they gazed into each other s eyes nothing pulled me demonstrated how poorly the director chose on this film you could tell that walters wanted two big names to anchor this film because he didn t have the glue to keep it together himself coupled with the fact that johnny was the most random character witnessed in cinematic history also hurt the overall emotional effect of the film what was johnny s relationship with nadine it felt like whatever was available these two men ran towards without any emotion or sympathy for anything it was disastrous not only was the acting enough to be scoffed at but the plot well was completely missing there were minor threads of plot dangling throughout the film like the dysfunctional wardrobe that garland wore during one of the dance sequences that dress completely represented the direction of this film the dress itself was the actual plot while the falling pieces of fabric represented the audience being tossed about and thrown on the floor in hopes to reconnect with the dress again sometime during the performance alas we never did due to the plot we jumped literally from emotion to emotion never quite sealing a secure moment throughout one scene we are trying to connect with johnny and hannah the next with hannah and don then there is nadine and hannah or was it johnny and what about don and nadine jump jump jump it became obviously clear that walters knew that this was a flimsy plot and instead of fixing it pushed more song and dance into the film to attempt to cover the soiled sections it did not work our flimsy characters no matter how well their singing could not conceal this broken direction that walters obviously lost control of finally there were the songs decent numbers but just too many what was the infamous easter parade you would think that a film that chose to have this as their title would explain the ritual a bit further sure there was a song but i kept watching astaire jump around so often that the dizziness caused me to miss the lyrics of the songs there is no need to break into song so often about absolutely nothing walter s needed to take a page from a true musical like singing in the rain to show him how to correctly combine a great plot with some great songs overall i didn t like this film i needed better characters stronger stories and the director to just tighten down on this runaway balloon i think if you saw astaire at a bar today looking like he did in easter parade the first words out of your mouth would be glen quagmire he looked like an utter sleaze that preyed on young women but maybe it was astaire just trying to stay with his character grade out of 
nothing golden about this one this film is based on a concept that has potential a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things but it doesn t deliver clearly the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us but he pretty much drops the ball right there usually with this sort of plot you are at least given the illusion that someone knows the answer and what s more has some clue about what to do with it as well there s no such suspension of disbelief in this one nor even an attempt at such adding injury if you count eye strain to insult the whole thing is shot in grainy b w with annoying mtv style jump cuts in the awards for obnoxious splash films of the year this one takes the cake but not the pi 
what was this bride with the white hair had hardly any action and really disappointed me i like the story line and everything and it s pretty sad but i wanted to see more fight scenes don t get this movie is you are expecting action 
not nearly as good as virtual enounters the original film was about a girl checking out this erotic virtual reality machine and it was hot ! this sequel is mostly about some guys and their adventures using the same basic machine my verdict too many guys not enough babes 
the family with no manners everett stone dermot mulroney as wooden as usual brings his girlfriend played by sarah jessica parker home for christmas to meet his family he wants to ask for the family stone which his mother promised him to ask her to marry him diane keaton his mom keeps referring to it as a wedding ring but it s clearly an engagement ring in any case everyone in his family except his brother ben is extremely hateful towards her causing her to call her sister claire danes for moral support and move into a hotel for the duration the whole thing about the bedrooms is silly why can t the two brothers share why can t the two girls share why is the gay deaf son with a hearing man that s not likely half the time the family uses sign language the other half he s somehow expected to read lips when someone is not even facing him a waste of two hours 
awful but for teri hatcher teri hatcher fans can perhaps get some value for money but for her and her ample body on ample display this movie is just not worth the time terrible direction awful story miserable music ! 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
macgyver on stupid pills as mentioned in another review stolen scenes from runaway train not just clips but entire scenes also the plane crash scene from cliffhanger still worth for a dvd just for the other action 
rent it don t buy it and then fast forward i consider myself fairly open when it comes to unique or even delayed plot structure except here i must admit the best parts of this movie were in the trailer this movie made no sense and the only possible reference to babel was that you could understand no one i fast forwarded through of the hour movie and didn t miss a thing if you must watch it rent it and don t think it s worth keeping for an extra day based on the trailer it won t be 
only a few more laughs by the time i came to this movie i had already gotten there first three up in smoke was fantastic next movie was great nice dreams was good this was was pretty poor they get pretty desparate at some points here and they constantly repeat chracters we ve seen already the low points are when they attempt to impersonate two homosexuals badly the astronaut which is cheech miming for minutes of in space and then pretentds to jerk off at the end also when they got to harry palms masterbating champion that was about as low and unfunny as you could get just awful all the points in the stand up go on about a minute too long including the fake nightclub the people laughing at cheech doing a redneck had to have been payed actors there are some good points not that many though maybe the wrestling scene and some of the scene with chong recording with a videocamera in the hotel room they don t seem to do much in this i wanted something different which is what i got but i didn t think it would be this horrible these guys can do better 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
not the right actors james spader was supposed to be in the last season of diner that would be my only reason for buying it he is certainly not in this one ! so where is he are there no diner videos or dvds with james spader

a true loss of faith faith hathaway had just graduated high school and was one week away from going into the army she was full of hope and life robert willie the man this movie was based on along with his accomplice raped and murdered her she was raped stabbed times and raped after she died the director of this movie denied requests made by faith s mother and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die where was the mercy for faith where was the compassion for faith where were the people protesting for faith s life finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to faith what about her suffering and that of her family barely a foot note in this movie ohh and sister prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case

boring tacky watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled boring and tacky even by horror standards the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet hence the title i ve seen far worse but those worse movies were more quotenjoyablequot than this the following morning you probably won t remember having seen it if only the monster had eaten this movie s negative then we would all be spared

relative to other abs videos not very good this video is not very good at all i have been using the minute abs video for a few weeks and i have seen results already ! i thought that i would add some variety to my routine by using a different video but in choosing this video i failed ! the workouts are for those who squeeze in workouts during their lunch break without any time to shower you will not break a sweat with this one 
star trek animated v the weekest of the volumes i erased the first episode showing satan as a misunderstood alien the second one is only ok a bad link to a great cartoon series 
the movie a gem ! the razor release a shame ! era release excellent watching the razor release which i bought to save a few dollars elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times fortunately i was able to find the much praised version released by era of taiwan from a seller here on amazon and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog sheer perfection 
you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
one word depressing this movie i think was just plain depressing ! just when you think something good and happy will happen someone dies people seperate bones are broken so on and so forth this movie got alot of great reviews and it was a fun movie but for people who like complete happy endings this film is not for you 
annoying lear i didn t enjoy the film i also didn t enjoy the original play by shakespeare king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays i don t consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done and to add nothing of value to the original you can set it wherever you like in medieval japan or on the moon what s the difference it s king lear a downer of a play there s nothing great about ran just as there s nothing great about lear and it takes up three hours of your time a moron named lear or hidetoro or whatever his name is relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father he is right of course and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily he s wanted dead or dead in this treatment of the annoying plot he loses his mind he has a faithful follower or two they overact there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk am i supposed to care what happens to him why because he used to be a powerful king and a cruel one you may as well cry over saddam hussein look at this movie with fresh eyes look at shakespeare s king lear with fresh eyes this stuff simply is not very entertaining and is not very good the hell with king lear he s an annoyance 
dvd put it on dvd i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone 
thaks a lot i have not seen this movie but thanks to the review of a viewer from july i don t have to 
missleading and incorrect this movie is entirely fictional and is not based on true events first of all the great saviors family was killed by muslims and so he chooses to go killing some muslims in a completely different country that in in itself shows that the director hates muslims and limits all muslims to being bad the other thing is the way that he portraied bosnian muslims main causes killers of the war which is a complete lie the serbs goal was to eliminate the whole bosnian muslim population and create a dominant ethinc group the serbs ofcourse also he forgot to mention the attack on srebrenica where serbs killed over civillians in just one day i just have to asume that the director loathes all muslims as he completely lied 
has some redeeming points but giving you a brief rundown where i stand i thought part was pretty good part had some interesting things about it i didn t much like part part started to pick up the pace again part was surprisingly good i think part was arguably the best i didn t like part this th chapter was a little better than part but that is not saying much the story begins with jason being brought back to life with the help of electricity this reuses the technique from part but it doesn t bring back the same impact jason claims his st victims and then makes his way to a boat full of teenagers heading towards new york here the story starts to lose credibility at least part made sense when he headed back to crystal lake jason will return to the area that s familiar to him no matter what you call it it s still camp crystal lake to him so in this th chapter why does jason go out of his way to board a ship heading for new york i know some people thought it was interesting to see jason aboard a ship and that it added something to see jason s potential victims trapped on a ship i admit this is a valid defense for the movie but my question is why did jason go out of his way to board this ship in the first place moving on one of jason s possible victims is a fairly well developed character rennie who has a tragic past with water and has hallucinations of jason alright i admit this is one interesting thing rennie s uncle charles is not exactly the nicest person but unlike dr cruise from part at least charles has some redeeming features at times his concern for rennie seems genuine when sean s father is killed charles takes a moment to offer a bit of sympathy and at times he is concerned over the safety of others another interesting character is sean the son of the captain he wants to please his father but feels he will be unable to become the captain that his father is however becoming the captain his father wants him to may be the only way to save at least a few of the people on the ship alright another redeeming feature moving on there is the typical high body count but people manage to escape to new york city unfortunately they run into thugs who rob them and run off with rennie another redeeming moment for charles is at least he shows discretion in trying to rescue rennie naturally it isn t long before jason arrives in new york city another problem i have with this movie is why does jason go out of his way to hunt down these people in a whole city at least the previous movies made sense early in part we learn that jason will take revenge on anyone who enters his territory again and in parts and even at least jason was staying in his own domain attacking anyone who happened to be there to be sure in part jason did attack some people away from the camp grounds but at least he was on his way back to the area that was familiar to him moving on there was one other element i had to admit was somewhat redeeming we all know jason is a brutal killer but in one scene he is portrayed as almost heroic when he unwittingly saves rennie from the two thugs that kidnapped her and were trying to rape her interesting twist i admit i ll admit it was comical when of the last people screamed for help because they were being chased by a murderer and a waitress could only say welcome to new york and of course in a typical friday the th fashion people manage to survive the massacre and come out alive i ll admit this isn t the worst friday the th that honor is shared between parts and i ll conclude by saying that this th chapter does have some redeeming moments and you may find it to be an interesting twist but you have to be willing to swallow some things that aren t consistent with the rest of the series if you re willing to do this then you will probably will enjoy it more than i did 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
to bad not my cup a tea poor sound and average picture just for excalibur freaks 
not for three year olds this is a great movie with a mistaken rating if your three year old is enjoying this movie please re think what you show your children really 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
overrated transit station letter writerforhire dora although she writes letters she never sends is relatively closed off from the world around her but is forced to open up when she is begged to write a letter for a woman to her young son s long lost father as dora witnesses this mother get hit by a bus in the next moment she realizes the young son is basically orphaned for the moment so she opens up but not in the feel good maternal instinctto spare way american viewers might expect no dora is keen to exploit this find and tries to sell josue the little boy for a television eventually though dora forms a kind of bond with josue and goes out searching for the boy s father unfortunately it seems too easy for dora who is obviously hardened to life and all its sensitivities to break down all these carefully formed barriers her emotion somehow does not seem authentic toward the boy as a result the performance is nowhere near the triumph most reviewers have claimed and the film lacks a certain credibility sure the film is watchable and somewhat interesting but it was overrated 
where s richard pryor when we need him eddie murphy is a comical guy but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this of course who is the right guy for it one of the questions i can t stand to think about in this movie is how dolittle hears the animals speak but their lips move and nobody notices can t they connect the dots obviously not and obviously the filmmakers couldn t either 
cheeselaweez what happen here as curious as i was about this movie it had me dazed the good shepherd always struck me symbol for christianity shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten what s good about that fortunately sheep don t have the intelligence to be paranoid with bourne identity movies under his belt matt damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies is this one a killer or dead on arrival with a budget of m we ve got oscar winning actors writers cinematographers and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see pet project of actor turningdirector robert de niro the good shepherd tells a story of the cia from its early days weighing in at just under three hours the scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that s miss you won t get it this is a shame because it s a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot this movie is told from damon s point of view its scope is epic and covering the years from before the cia was even a speck in president truman s eye to and the bay of pigs we see the founding years the london blitz post war reconstruction in berlin and increasingly intricate machinations as the cold war gathers pace angelina jolie doesn t feature in much of the movie but when she does she get into character very well it s enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable robert de niro got to love him in the director s chair is sadly the weakest link although he handles it professionally almost magisterially he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum convey gradual moral decay or make this the godfather standard bearer of cia films he s done a fine job just bitten off a bit more than he can chew what he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world s most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to given that his mentors are people like francis ford coppola who is the executive producer with sufficient dedication it is easy to imagine de niro pulling off an oscar for direction in a future film his grasp is very broad and all it needs is a little tweaking

terrible do not waste your money purchasing this movie wait until it shows on tv if you re unlucky enough to see it the music for the story was inappropriate and totally threw off the entire story instead of following the story my husband and i kept concentrating on the terrible music dont waste your money 
u won t care for this one sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the u boat men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of u boats machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful 
stars this movie sucks sometimes they come back is a terrible attempt at a horror movie i love tim matheson and i think he is a very good actor but this movie is just incredibly lame the idea that these four little punks with leather jackets on are supposed to be scary as ghosts simply does nothing for me except make me thoroughly disappointed that i wasted my time watching this crap the is movie is a joke ! the scene this movie is based on is a sad scene for sure but to base the whole movie on it is going to far with nothing basically this whole movie is much ado about nothing i think the biggest joke and the most terrible thing about this movie are these little leather jacket wearing punks as ghosts are supposed to scare the viewer and it simply does not work the premise behind this movie is flawed and lacking in substance from which a horror movie can be successfully derived sometimes they come back is entirely ineffective as a horror movie and evokes only laughter from a sophisticated horror movie fan the sequel is so bad it is not worthy of a comment some people call sometimes they come back a good horror movie i just call it rubbish 
the worst movie that van damme has ever starred in a man seeks vengeance against a gang that stole his motorcycle straight up predictable and undeniably boring van damme looks so terrible in that beard i hope he never does a movie with his beard like that again the movie is stupid the plot is so lame and the action is so boring i don t even understand how a die hard fan of van damme could like this ! this is a movie that doesn t even deserve to be in stores this definitely ain t worth one cent of its price if you are a van damme fan do not waste your hard earned money on this movie a walk in the woods is more exciting than this if this movie really does appeal to you then you obviously don t know your action movies too well 
goin coconuts the vhs took quite a while to arrive i had ordered other items at the same time and it arrived almost weeks later than all the others i actually had given up on it s showing up the video itself rolls quite a bit at the end of the video when played however with the age of the movie i will grant them some slack i was disappointed in service and the product i will not buy another movie from this seller 
hahaha well what can i say i m usually not very picky about seamonstermovies especially when there s a shark involved and though it didn t surprise me red water hm whatever you do don t believe the cover of the dvd that shark looks frightening and looks to be a great white the shark in this movie however is a bull shark and very plastic in a non hollywoodsencethere is plenty of shark in red water some reviewers here mean that you hardly see the shark but that s not the problem the problem is that you see the shark too many times and as mentioned it s not much to look at ! the effects are something between jaws and that explains a lot if you are familiar with those the acting is what you d expect from a b movie ok at its best the script is paperthin but it could ve been more watchable if more story less shark i doubt that i will watch red water again b movies like anacondas and lake placid well at least the effects are somewhat believable i didn t expect much but got less 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
dirty work blows i love norm macdonald and this is the dumbest movie of all tim 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
great routines too fast moves this video has some very effective routines but the moves are performed much too fast for safe form because they are done so fast injuries can incur she starts out slowly but quickly go into what she calls super sets i have several videos and that is definitely not the proper way to super set normally you could modify the moves by performing them slower but because they are time crunch workouts about minutes each segment you really don t have the time to do that definitely not one of her better videos the routines are easy but because of the improper form used not recommended for the beginner as it could do my damage then good if you are a denise austin fan even though her voice is a bit annoying and this is not one of her better videos she s still a great instructor try one of her hit the spot segments 
more proaganda than documentary bottom line if you liked gore you will love it and visa versa it is one sided plain and simple nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough english to distinguish gore from bush democrats wanted quantity and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just couldn t get right 
why aren t zero stars available for rating maybe i should have known better but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same this is a four dollar movie in any department store

annie hall s ugly sibling a long time ago the local art house theater where i lived used to run manhattan in tandem with annie hall at first i thought woody allen used the idea of a man in his forties sleeping with a high school student as a way to be tasteless and funny i thought he was using it to contrast it with the tasteful camerawork and the tasteful gershwin orchestrations but then i realized i was in denial and it pointed to a deeper much more disturbing aspect of woody allen as everyone knows the cinematography is excellent and the gershwin tunes are great but you have to wade through a fair amount of misogyny while watching this movie the main argument seems to be that adult women are either bitchy man eating lesbians the meryl streep character or neurotic yet scathing and bitchy that word again intellectuals diane keaton and are driving adult men into the arms of unthreatening year olds like tracy mariel hemingway i also think there s a problem since the woody allen character criticizes yale for his ethical lapses but woody allen isaac never asks himself questions about his own behavior meryl streep s character did the right thing when before the movie starts she leaves isaac woody allen isaac is out of touch with reality i really wanted to like manhattan and i overlooked a lot but it s glaringly obvious what this movie s subtext is saying isaac wants everyone in the movie to change except himself 
beep beep chuck jones continues to entertain new audiences with the road runner and wile e coyote chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo i found it to be very exciting if you have road runner vs wile e coyote the classic chase from warner bros golden jubiliee karat collection this video might not be for you the other five cartoons actually appear on that video zip n snort operation rabbit hook line and stinker beep beep and ready woolen and able otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages 
warning positively disgraceful edition of a star film i just wanted to write this review and warn people to save their money my friend bought this dvd thank god it wasn t me and we were both disappointed to see that it was a horrible print badly transferred this dvd is disgraceful but the movie itself gets stars of course just thought i d let you know avoid this incredibly lousy dvd of polanski s classic film at all costs if you decide to go against my advice and buy it well i tried to warn you ! i don t usually write reviews of dvds preferring instead to focus on the film in question but this was one instance where i felt it would be unfair not to say caveat emptor if you have a region free dvd player get the anchor bay uk version available through amazon couk for a much nicer edition 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
lack of balance leads to lack of credibility in short the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across as it should do in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act at the same time however it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create what the film ends up doing is the one thing it must avoid at all cost in order to be effective not to choose sides the catholic croats and the muslims are the victims while the orthodox serbs are wholly to blame that is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a noble cause there is a term used in such situations and it s called propaganda a more balanced and objective approach ie there are no good guys and bad guys in such conflicts with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore more successful the ultimate goal is good but the method used is not necessarily the correct one another setback is in relation to the acting or lack of it that is to say that the cast are badly in need of acting lessons with the exception of woody harrelson the acting oh my the acting is beyond words school plays and pre school for that matter have better actors ! it is truly sad yet another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot storyline for which the writers and director are to blame in conclusion the potential for a good movie was there if only the writers director had the ability to write and direct ! a shame really 
i was a male war bride not one of cary grant s better ones too goofy and it didn t look as if he enjoyed the part 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
indiscreet dvd do not buy this i have bought diffferent copies of this factory sealed and i can not play clear through either of them the movie is as wonderful as it has always been however the physical dvd is hopeless i have tried to play them on my apple dvd drive and seperrate dvd players and they all freeze up 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
terrible this movie was absolutely terrible the one star is for the concept which is interesting but the execution wowit is bad 
great play miscast cyrano and a dull flat english translation cyrano is one of the greatest verse plays ever written unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano he s a great clumsy side of beef not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac with the best will in the world his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance the english translation was especially commissioned for this film it is undistinguished prosy and dull it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the s by the great american actor walter passmore get the jose ferrer version this one s a dog 
wheres the brains imgaine this said by the wendy s old lady yeah that s how i felt when i noticed the lack of gore and the lack of development in the characters even the zombies are the same thoughout the picture how can a zombie go from one part of town to the next in what would take a serious muscle car at least an hour regardless it s worth owning to have the scene where they rise out of the cemetery the kid is downright annoying but when i was a kid i liked him ! suppose it s not time to have kids yet aye regardless it could have been better flawed but if you viewed this before the first one don t let it stop you from getting the first ! the first one rocked i thought the rd one was produced much better than this as well but they just keep killing this series as part and i once again heard were terrible 
on training we all know that tamilee has that body didn t expect her to be the only body in the video i am more for a group atmosphere so in that regard i pass on this video maybe next time tami 
not as good as i remember when i was watching topless woman was all i needed to like a sex comedy now years later this movie didn t hold up so well the comedy is not that funny as well 
quaint comedy could have been better most l amp h fans know that the boys made a long series of mgm fox pictures which reflected the big studio quotassembly line quot film making approach and the wartime atmosphere students of film comedy understand how the quottraditionalquot stan amp ollie would be somewhat suppressed in that regard however it s very sad to watch a decent premise with great performers go completely to waste as it does in aaw the presence of edgar kennedy should lift th proceedings instead it reinforces the melancholia i found the drunken scene most distasteful still l amp h followers might want to place it somewhere on their video carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
the president s analyst my husband and i are both james coburn fans but we found this movie to be unwatchable the story line is boring in that you just keep seeing him getting called in the middle of the night and then leaving the president s room we watched this once and will not waste the time on watching it again 
like all gossip a lot of talk about nothing a very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level the movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue i ve heard better lines in fast times at richmond high thank you altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing don t believe the great reviews about this film the film might appeal to the year old crowds fantasizing about how cool college life might be with all the cool people and parties if you re not in that category skip this boring film and save both your time and your money 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
great to learn about yuppies i should have known this movie would be terrible because it stars matthew mcconaughey mcconaughey plays one thing well the smarmy yuppie having grown up in a working class manhattan family i know the type well he does an excellent job at this one role for which he is type cast again and again this film is no exception the worst thing about this movie is that even though i only watched about i had to use grease cutting cleaner to clean my tv screen free of all the slime 
movies like this make you ask was this sequel really neccessary the original jungle book was inventive whitty uplifting and charming the characters had depth and a beauty that in its time was unique and wonderful the original disney jungle book story was told with great feeling that was a source of fun and inspiration to me growing up as an autistic child i can honestly say the original disney jungle book movie was the only movie i loved that also touched my heart jungle book is is just a very badly executed attempt at recreating the awesomeness of the the original disney jungle book jungle book fails in all attempts to recreate any of the magic of the original disney jungle book jungle book is endlessly bland overall filled with nothing at all to justify wasting a moment of your life watching you will be better and more deeply entertained for hours watching newly poured cement dry compared to watching a moment of jungle book don t waste your time wacthing this garbage it is not worth anyones time or money it gets one star only because the amazon system does not allow me to post zero stars or better still stars in negative numbers 
not my cup of tea i bought this dvd based on reviews here on amazon i won t fault others for thier position it s just a matter of personal taste for me this was a big disapointment the story leaves a lot to be desired the character walker lee marvin gets away with a lot of crimes he shouldn t have the direction seemed to be a practice in doing something different but it failed i m sorry i bought this dvd 
pure garbage gee another steven segal bomb wonder what this guy is thinking about the story takes place in poland and a little girl whom seagal has befriended via penpal has been kidnapped for prostitution purposes seagal arrives in warsaw and single handedly fights the turkish mob which is behind the above mentioned prostitution ring the finale is laughable as stevie being fat and old as he is proceeds to kill the bad guy witha sword steven it is time retire my boy

a tale told by a teenager signifying the premise that one could change specific events in ones past through psychic concentration could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller i don t condemn the film s corollary either that each change produces new unforseeable tragedies it s the way the story is told its ham fisted dialogue and plot its forced obscenity at every turn that reveals its teen sensibilities it is therefore fitting that the director s preferred ending is included here it is the perfect catharsis for teens who wish i was never born ! 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
a poor man s dick i m sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i m sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst or that level of indefatigable cuteness just go rent dick instead you ll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country

is cringeworthy a word i m surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond there really wasn t much here i liked the soundtrack was the usual pap you d expect from a family friendly movie though the sets were nice it seems this movie was just miscast mel just doesn t do comedy all that well at least for a lead role jame garner the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character although the cast is a powerhouse on paper sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball an example there was a sequence when bret asks his friends who are standing behind him to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting which as it turns out they are unable to do instead jodie and james blow madly just like the movie this movie reminds me a hell of a lot like the three amigo s on paper you would think it couldn t miss but on film it s painful to watch 
just when you think dolph can t get sink any lower i will be honest i like dolph lundgren a look at his filmography you see b movie classics such as the punisher universal soldier and blackjack dolph has been going trough a slump storm catcher and the startlingly routine jill the ripper and the awful minion aka fallen knight but with agent red dolph lundgren hits rock bottom agent red first of all steals it s music from predator and it s plot from counter measures oh i m not finished yet it steals footage from storm catcher the scene where jon penner steals the air craft while posing as dolph lundgren now penner is dolph lundgren is for goodness sake ! yet they try to pass it off as dolph lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission this scene made me wanna throw up but i hung in there it turns out more footage is stolen i swear i saw footage from iron eagle and iron eagle ii i saw footage from crimson tide and i saw footage from counter measures what the heck was dolph thinking when he signed for this junk i have no idea when i was a teen when showdown in little tokyo came out i thought dolph lundgren couldn t sink lower then showdown in little tokyo then when i saw the minion i was almost sure dolph couldn t do worse well i pray he can t do any worse because agent red is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life this is coming from a guy who likes don the dragon wilson bottomline on agent red s cover it says once exposed you cannot survive take this as a warning 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
not a movie about sharks a movie about poop this movie is the story of a man mark desantis who is killed mark s laptop is harpooned and then he is eaten by sharks his friend shark expertman suspects foul play so he and mark s sister go on a shark filled adventure to the bottom of the fishing grounds of some local tribesmen the tribesmen didn t harpoon mark s laptop though so the heroic duo look elsewhere then they find bad scientist he is bad or is he but he is bad because the whole movie is bad so are all the actors the shark footage is good but because it is literally ripped from past quotshark weeks quot it was really familiar as a final note the last shot of a shark clearly shows a fishing line stuck in it s mouth this line has nothing to do with quotshark attack quot but probably had something to do with the discovery channel episode it was initially filmed for this movie should be shark attacked poop 
monumental issues but fails to convince i have been a le carre fan until the end of the cold war i somehow still managed to follow him later for some time but now it is over definitely i disliked this novel and the movie is obnoxious rachel weisz is quite ridiculous in her part which idiot nominated her for her oscar is beyond the point zellweger got an oscar for an even more horrible performance recently in the otherwise quite acceptable cold mountain and even the otherwise great blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in the aviator to get one why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies my conclusion this world is strange it has no idea what is good and what not 
i would have picked zero stars but it wasn t an option first of all the only reason i started watching this movie was because my roommate got it and we re both lovers of the romantics the only reason i kept watching this movie after the first minutes was because i could already tell it was going to be completely and totally awful and would make for a few good laughs between the two of us beyond some very basic facts about the party of writers this movie is not grounded anywhere in reality the acting is way overdone and quickly becomes grating there is no plot whatsoever to speak of and the movie lacks any sense of clear direction or purpose it is simply a collection of random inexplicable and nonsensical events filled with frenzied sexuality animalism and vaguely defined hallucinations while i m sure the actual experience was not entirely tame and prudish i find it hard to believe that this is anywhere close to being accurate even when it tries to delve into pseudo philosophical discussion about the nature of love fear poetry etc that you would expect to emerge among these great literary figures which strangely does not happen often it utterly fails to make any understandable conclusions or statements and their real views beliefs and visions become hysterical ravings rather than the passionate philosophies that they were the film does not deal fully at all with mary s creation of the frankenstein story nor do any of the other characters write ghost stories as byron challenges them and as really took place the idea that the story was born out of mary s personal fears is an interesting one but this too spirals out of control and has almost nothing to do with frankenstein the premise behind this disaster of a movie is a good one and i think with the right script actors and director it could be an amazing exploration of authorship literary exploration and exchange and this fascinating group of writers that is not however what this film is ps if you do get seduced by the other reviews pay particular attention to the scenes in the billiard room i didn t know they had light bulbs in ! 
mediocre betty grable musical the good news is that fox finally released a betty grable musical on dvd so i m guessing fans are really happy about that the bad news is that as many have pointed out they picked one of the worse the reason seems pretty obvious grable is best remembered nowadays precisely for being a wwii pinup girl and like when this film was first produced the dvd makers are just banking on that betty grable musicals were formulaic and not particularly sophisticated they relied too heavily on her charms and showing off her famous legs but even her charisma cannot do much to save this movie if you love betty grable no matter what rejoice the fact that at least one of her musicals is on dvd if not then i suggest you skip this one and wait for the dvd release of one of her better movies 
not what i expected this is not the version of pirates shown on great performances it is a video of the actual stage performance in central park the video quality sound and stage settings do not compare to the great performances version which was superb very disappointing

don t be fooled i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed 
new york stock trader to messenger i don t think so contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script think about it take a dump on a stock and get wiped out now you are a messenger i do not think so i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades but this is crazy thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum yes he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote 
boooriiiiiing i want the two hours of my life back after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in that time is past even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your s and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated !

bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
jeremial johnson a stellar movie i love nature and cowboy movies jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i ve seen it is unforgetable it was my favorite robertredford movie he did very little talking talking in this movie he just acted his best performance ever the movie deals with the american indian also in a profound and touching way this movie is engrossing and based on a true story it s simply the best don t miss the opportunity to see this movie it is a classic it truly is in a league of it s own 
even worse than the th heaven remake this is my vote for rd worst movie ever made its dumb theres no violence hardly no blood and i actually got a headache from renee now i look chinese zelwack broad screaming for minutes and watching how bad the acting is this is like a drug that doesnt work and now i want my dollars and minutes of my life back 
not that great a number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible honestly i was not impressed the plot is disjointed and confusing jumping from the north african theatre to the european theatre almost seamlessly leaving the viewer thoroughly confused the character development is also very poor no one character stands out due to the fact that samuel fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue historically speaking this film is a joke during the action scenes when the germans have tanks they are in fact american tanks with the german symbol painted on also uniforms are sometimes inaccurate however the most annoying aspect is the fact that samuel fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the only squad fighting the entire war only once or twice do you see any other american troops this feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war of which these men are supposed to be a part of finally to make matters worse the film s action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical sloppy awkwardly placed and consist of ridiculous situations overall this movie was too long lacked character development for most of the movies characters was disjointed and was historically inaccurate for a movie that garnered so much hype i was expecting much much more 
avoid if you like vampire movies and if you want to see good acting there are very few movies that i haven t finished watching this now goes on the short list luckily i didn t rent this one and instead was excited to see it on tivo that is until after minutes in i was hoping a vampire would kill me this film while it has an r rating and there is a reason why even the toned down tv version was extremely graphic from pulling out someone s tongue watching a vampires head blow up and catch fire in the sun to blood spray there isn t anything wrong with a good horror movie but graphic violence to fill time so you don t have to have actors say anything seems a bit of a waste the premise of a rag tag bunch of vampire hunters joining forces to defeat evil could have been a great movie but the low budget director chosen and filming of this movie won t make it a classic on anyone s list in addition the movie was way overacted i don t know if everyone was trying to make the film better or what but the overacting made it to the point that it made the acting look horrible it got to the point i no longer cared who won a battle as i said this is one of less than a dozen movies i have been looking forward to seeing that i couldn t even finish gets star cause i can t give it less 
technical problems render this oater virtually unwatchable this undistinguished oater is made much worse by technical problems it isn t a bad little western and the two lead roles are played competently by vera miles whose most famous role was laurie jorgensen in the searchers and sam elliott who was born to make westerns it had a good plot and some beautiful desert locations unfortunately the film was not well shot none and i mean not one of the interior scenes is adequately lighted you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background the scenes in the cactus jail which are key and set up the movie might as well be taking place in a cave without even a candle for light then there s the dvd which is full frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film the dvd is blurry and shows every scratch spot and speck of dirt that years of obscurity could inflict on the print too bad miles and elliott deserved better frankly because of the technical issues the film is probably not worth wasting minutes on 
too bad friday the th wasn t lucky for this movie let s understand two things about slasher horror from the s first of all they had a legacy of saturating their own market and secondly they were simple stories born out of the twilight of an ever changing world with this in mind it would be easy to point out what is wrong with jason goes to hell the final friday however for the sake of time it might just as well be easier to point to what s right about it the answer to that is nothing ! all you ever wanted to know about jason is revealed and once you know the dark secret it will haunt you except for a small matter of cosmetics the dark secret is the same as the lemon revealed a short time earlier in new line s bad finale to the nightmare movies of course the only nightmare about that film was having to admit that you paid to watch it much the same with this piece of total garbage jason it would seem is not merely a specter capable of regeneration with a great rage at those who he feels are responsible for both his own and his mother s demise oh no the dark secret is that if you can find someone who shares his father s blood line cause lets face it his mother was not born a voorhees then you can see jason finally put to death or you can see him re born guess what happens here except the rebirth is anti climatic because he is nothing more than the same twisted mass of flesh that he was before he was blown apart by bombs and bullets at the beginning of the movie and apparently genetics has a preference for certain types of clothing and a certain mask because he is reborn with both in one laughable sequence you would be forgiven for thinking jason or as i d like to refer to him as the imposter being reborn meant the world would end however a mere minutes or so after he was reborn he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger who were the camp counselors who ignored jason as he died some ancient sumarian or egyptian people or something what s with the dagger that must be used why does it look like an artifact supplied to his niece oh this is a long story and is too tedious and boring to go through right now who finds the linda hamilton in her to terminate the terminator you ll be in for your just desserts if you think this repulsive piece of junk is worth even five minutes of your time of course there is plenty of blood and gore as the friday films always seem to have and there is also plenty to gross you out but if you think or feel anything towards the horror icon that made these films successful you ought to take a pass on this one 
skip this and go for something harder reading some of the reviews it s hard for me to believe that we are all referring to the same movie some decent soft core stuff but the overall acting plot completely sucks the action was tolerable but you d be better off skipping this and going for something harder if you want better satisfaction and or follow through 
cliche ridden worst of kung fu waste of time with all due respect to different tastes i found five deadly venoms lethally boring i thought the dialog was trite and incoherent the humor lame and predictable the martial arts stunts and display average to bad the plot lack subtlety imagination or surprise and although some of the sets and costumes looked authentic i could not finish this loser perhaps it was better than bad when it first came out but hard to watch after more recent kung fu fare 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
just terrible the acting was terrible there was basically no plot if this movie represents a woman s view of the conan movie genre then that s just very sad red sonya was better 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
it s so stupid but not funny i don t even know how cheech and chong fans could like this movie because this movie is really different from up in smoke or their other movies in up in smoke there was at least some direction to the movie but in this movie most of it is composed of lame comedy gimmicks that were entirely not funny unless you are high off your ass or have an i q less than they don t even smoke in this movie ! the closest thing they do to drugs is eat some marijuana leaves how stupid do they think we are stay away from this one 
do not waste your time or money see the original do not waste your time or money see the original once in awhile a remake of a movie from another culture works for example seven samurai becomes magnificant seven most of the time the remake is trash the original la femme nikita is a great movie exciting with a strong political viewpoint this version is simply hollywood pablum 
even my thirteen year old nephew found this idiotic and you know when a young man in full testosterone blow finds a film with a hottie like milla in it to be an incomprehensible waste of time that it really must be a stinker not even worth renting we saw this upchuck as a first run at austin s legendary alamo drafthouse and walked out wondering why we had bothered id spare you that if i could 
better than many but doesn t match the hype on the most fundamental level i ea sexual semierotic level l ennui most definitely has its moments as a total film however it stutters more than a few times technically the subtitles occasionally flash too fast or are offered with no contrast so they become almost unreadable the camerawork is quite good however with a definite european style the story itself is also intriguing but once the point is made it has nowhere to go the problems begin with the actors and plot not that the actors were bad they were actually very good but you understand from minute one that martin isn t wrapped too tightly his treatment of a fan for example early on so his bizarre behavior once he meets cecelia isn t surprising in the least more simply the guy evinces no sympathy in the least from the viewer none he s a complete ass he comes off as needy selfish and egomaniacial one of those boors who are so deeply personally insecure they become outwardly obnoxious and nasty to hide it from everyone you really don t care what ultimately happens to him and also understand that if he did get what he wanted in the film he would immediately reject it once he did just to be hurtful cecilia the more you get to know her is just as bad in another way she doesn t come off as stupid as someone else said or obtuse but as almost totally uncaring and unfeeling not to mention far more immature than her few years she simply does whatever she wants whenever she can without a lot of regard of how it can hurt or affect people she understands how they can feel things but unless it touches her directly and negatively doesn t really care look at how she regarded her father all in all it s hard to feel sympathy for her as well she s not opaque but almost completely transparent and to say the film s point was hammered home way too long or that the ending was ridiculously abrupt is putting it mildly 
oh god i want the last three hours of my life back i cannot vouch for the accuracy of this film because it lost my full attention past the opening scene after five minutes my significant other was asleep always a bad sign he ll watch anything the movie is about the last two months of van gogh s life and it feels like the viewer is watching each day pass by each scene draws out innocuous tedious details e g a scene van gogh examined by his physician sucks up a good ten minutes of the time physician chats with his cook his son yada yada van gogh undresses cook snaps green beans physician walks back into the room more small talk silence there s lots of scenes of people tending to their personal hygiene eating dinner and making small talk in subtitle this is just an example of the pace of the entire movie and this sucker is l ong it s like watching the last of the lord of the rings trilogy only infinitely less interesting if you feel you absolutely must watch this film plug it in your dvd player grab a good book your cell phone and your laptop so you can net surf this film just will not end ever 
say no to dubs even though fans of hk cinema have as a whole come a long way since hk films were generally only seen in the states on saturday afternoon television some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing hk films in their original language with subtitles this film is available from columbia tristar only in a dubbed format and for that reason i won t be getting the region release of this film 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
dvds a must i am giving this one star only because it is on vhs and not dvd i don t even own a vcr anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house the day that they come out with all ten seasons on dvd i will buy them all and really wish i could now ! i just bought the pilot episode on dvd and am hoping that this will sell well and that they ll go on to put all the seasons on dvd already i know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them ! 
oh the pain the pain of it all mortal kombat annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters odd considering that in interviews after the first movie all of them said they d want be willing to come back for a sequel to the horrible even by standards cg effects to the cliched fight scenes geetwo women in a mud pit i bet it took them all night to come up with that one virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat video game and set immediately after the first movie which while not great looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan played by brian thompson the alien bounty hunter from the x files and his army shown in most scenes as a small band of extras oooh scary as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity with only a week to do anything about it lord raiden played by james remar replacing the and i can t believe i m saying this much better christopher lambert in the role once again enlists the help of liu kang robin shou sonia blade sandra hess and princess kitana talisa soto along with help from a select few other characters from the video games crowded lineup to prevent this from happening the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad however given the film s obviously low budget the weak screenplay the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film and most jarringly direction even more inept than that of paul w s anderson it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high only to have practically everything come crashing down the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie as well as music by kmfdm megadeth rammstein juno reactor and others if ever you re looking to punish yourself for something then by all means watch this movie however if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself you will avoid this movie like the plague believe me you ll thank yourself later 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
accurate but boring this is probably the most accurate version of a tale of two cities but it s the worst version to own or watch sticking strickly to the plot of the story and historical facts this movie has no spark or passion it s an easy out though for the teens to lazy to read the book for english the movie is extremely long which is part of the problem and the acting is horribly done i found myself straining to stay awake the script is something out of the middle ages with no modern word adaptations it s hard to imagine any of the characters are real the storyline is straight out the book with no hollywood adaptations this causing part of the problem you don t get any sparks between lucy and carton or dialouge it focuses more on the war and hardly anything on the romance or passion in the story all in all this movie in my opinon butchered one of the classic love stories in literature tale of two cities fans we know buy the classic it s always better 
boring we read this book in ila and it was so boring ! the character had no emotions and it was very slow moving with no excitement i almost fell asleep don t read this boo 
super awful it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it s one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her 
is this rotten or is it all terribly brave the adventures of sherlock holmes smarter brother isn t mycroft but the forgotten third brother sigerson actually the assumed name holmes used in the adventure of the empty house and there s a lot to forget about this failed attempt to do for the holmes family what gene wilder did for the frohnkensteens without a collaborator on the screenplay and taking the directorial reins himself as well as the starring role there s far more unfettered self indulgence here than wit there s thankfully a little less pointless hysteria from wilder than usual although this is sadly more than compensated for by excessive yelping from leo mckern and tedious showboating from dom de luise now there s a surprise indeed this may well be the only film in which chronic overactor aubrey morris gives the most restrained performance there s also an excess of messy eating and childish humor to contend with not to mention the unforgivable waste of marty feldman s unique talents in a dull sidekick role there is one funny sequence in a ballroom and a couple of moments where the ideas are good enough to survive the sledgehammer execution but when albert finney in a one shot cameo in the film s night at the operatic finale turns to the camera to ask is this rotten or is it all terribly brave it s not difficult to come up with an answer as with the world s greatest lover fox s dvd offers a decent widescreen transfer as well as a fullscreen version with optional original mono or remastered stereo mixes aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for three other wilder films young frankenstein the world s greatest lover and silver streak the only extra is an audio commentary by wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that you ll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu ! 
terrible transfer to dvd this is absolutely no improvement on the poor vhs video tape a travesty i subtract all stars for the terrible transfer menu and options 
regarding the hd dvd have not yet seen the movie this was one of the films i ordered for my very first hd order also included in the order were king kong mission impossible the good shephard children of men of these only kk and mi played on my new xbox hd dvd player the other three discs could not play i started looking into this on the net and found that this was some sort of interface problems with the xbox although i only found this problem relating to the good shephard and children of men specifically and no instances of this problem occuring with a scanner darkly during my search on the net it could be that i was just unlucky and got a defective copy of this hd dvd i have read that there will be update release from ms to correct this problem through xbox live but i m not sure this will fix the problem if you ve got the xbox hd dvd player be warned this may not work on your player anyone else having this problem i would certainly like to know 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
infested or a sharp stick in the eye take the stick infested josh olson its really kind of impressive that a movie this bad doesn t get shelved somewhere along the line and yet here it is in all its painfully cheesy glory on my screen daring me to turn it off i almost gave in to the temptation but i kept watching for you dear reader so i can give you a full account of the true horror to be found here the ninety minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back if you rent this movie and sit down to watch it the story what there is of it a number of friends show up at the estate of one of their high school buddies who s killed himself there s all the post funeral bonding stuff and everything s looking remarkably big chill when things go horribly horribly wrong thanks to vicious genetically altered flies that possess humans and turn them into soulless murderers yes you got that right as usual the only reason to watch a movie like this is the cheesecake factor any jo johnson plays the dead guy s girlfriend well ex i guess and there is an obligatory scene where she shows a whole lot of skin it is not however an out andout nude scene sorry guys there is also the gorgeous lisa ann hadley general hospital port charles who s really starting to look like kate hodge this is a good thing a very good thing youre certainly not watching for the special effects amateur even by microbudget indie standards the acting atrocious the script even worse the direction competent at best the cinematography ditto the soundtrack cheesy early eighties pop that should have faded into obscurity years ago or really anything else so it s gotta be the cheesecake and that s all well and good but you can do that on fast forward i strongly suggest that route at least you ll waste less time on this half 
cult classic please a waste of my childhood i actually saw this movie when i was and it freaked me out abit but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world dont even rent this i dont even know why you are considering the film i only give it a star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since 
why come you don t have a tattoo idiocracyit s fair to compare mike judge s office space to his latest film idiocracy because both movies approach their subjects from a position of satire i argue that office space is far more successful due to a smarter script a great cast excellent soundtrack and sympathetic characters while office space tells an intelligent and funny tale idiocracy is a morality comedy with one running joke the world is getting dumber it s a boring tired joke that doesn t get any funnier the more judge tells it in the end idiocracy is professional wrestling for people with master s degrees before listing grievances i should write that i generally agree with judge s assessment of the united states and the world at large instead of being used wisely to advance humanity media has been engaged as a weapon to wage war against ideas and experimentation and used to promote emotional conservation of the status quo unthinking idiots who gather around the idiot box every evening are complicit in this downward spiral i will also admit that i liked judge s assertion that the average person today can make a difference but that one must take a risk and lead the world left to the idiots will inevitably become worse finally the movie has helped me to decide to cancel my cable television subscription tomorrow the only new shows i watch anymore are the daily show and the colbert report i don t watch all of the good and rare movies that air every night on tmc i watch re runs of cartoon shows that i have seen a million times i don t read books often enough instead i spend too many nights watching terrible documentaries on the prison system i cannot continue this mindless existence i also cannot credit idiocracy with all of my motivation to leave mainstream media i ve known that something had to change for a while now but the movie made what i already knew more urgent demanding immediate changes you might wonder why i gave the film a low score if i found that it positively affected my life first and foremost the movie is dumb and doesn t trust the viewer to get it without overwhelmingly heavy handed sight gags and so called dialogue this is utterly ironic because the film is trying to teach the viewer to look more critically at the world to question why intelligence challenges and knowledge are being shunted in favor of the cheapest most melodramatic and instant of gratifications the most complete irony however is that the film does to its audience what it claims contemporary culture does to us now it appeals to our emotions instead of our minds there s nothing intellectually engaging or thought provoking about this film the movie consists entirely of fears you have already considered and so the film s only function is to reinforce biases perhaps judge is playing a joke on those who think this film is profound it wouldn t be the first time beavis and butthead ridiculed its audience while they were watching it it was brilliant i have a feeling though that judge simply misfired with idiocracy 
poirot should have detected this remake really sucked really rushed and other than suchet the acting was terrible by most of the cast 
i would have picked zero stars but it wasn t an option first of all the only reason i started watching this movie was because my roommate got it and we re both lovers of the romantics the only reason i kept watching this movie after the first minutes was because i could already tell it was going to be completely and totally awful and would make for a few good laughs between the two of us beyond some very basic facts about the party of writers this movie is not grounded anywhere in reality the acting is way overdone and quickly becomes grating there is no plot whatsoever to speak of and the movie lacks any sense of clear direction or purpose it is simply a collection of random inexplicable and nonsensical events filled with frenzied sexuality animalism and vaguely defined hallucinations while i m sure the actual experience was not entirely tame and prudish i find it hard to believe that this is anywhere close to being accurate even when it tries to delve into pseudo philosophical discussion about the nature of love fear poetry etc that you would expect to emerge among these great literary figures which strangely does not happen often it utterly fails to make any understandable conclusions or statements and their real views beliefs and visions become hysterical ravings rather than the passionate philosophies that they were the film does not deal fully at all with mary s creation of the frankenstein story nor do any of the other characters write ghost stories as byron challenges them and as really took place the idea that the story was born out of mary s personal fears is an interesting one but this too spirals out of control and has almost nothing to do with frankenstein the premise behind this disaster of a movie is a good one and i think with the right script actors and director it could be an amazing exploration of authorship literary exploration and exchange and this fascinating group of writers that is not however what this film is ps if you do get seduced by the other reviews pay particular attention to the scenes in the billiard room i didn t know they had light bulbs in ! 
really deserves stars but that s not a choice this movie sucks it sucks donkey balls if you enjoyed this movie you should be shot you should be shot in the head die you evil fans of this horrible movie who the hell would put the time money and effort into such a peice of junk i suggest that everyone who was involved in the making of this quotmoviequot should be rounded up and sent to consentration camps i think this is the major problems of this world this movie is the reason war exists this movie is the reason people hate each other please read this review and never watch that peice of crap 
resuscitating a classic movie with a lacking lethargic sequel three decades later there are moments in this inconsequential comedy when i can see a bright future for jennifer aniston s light comedic talents even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure friends persona she plays sarah huttinger a likeably insecure new york times obituary writer going home to pasadena to attend her younger sister annie s wedding sarah is picture pretty and engaged to a nice unflappable guy named jeff who accompanies her at the same time she s unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out ofsorts with her well todo family a ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family her feisty tart tongued grandmother katherine who tells sarah about her late mother s pre wedding tryst in mexico that gives rise to questions about sarah s paternity all the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy s blessedly brief minute running time but screenwriter ted griffin hangs it all on the idea that sarah s family may have been the inspiration for the robinsons in charles webb s novel the graduate which of course is the basis of mike nichols classic movie the tie in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it in fact there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie and director rob reiner is unable to overcome it because sarah s dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant the dialogue never feels sharp perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film moreover the story is set rather arbitrarily in to make the timelines make sense with the stars ages beyond aniston a strong cast has been set adrift playing katherine like an even more embittered variation on aurora greenway shirley maclaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for mrs robinson even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are as the aging but still magnetic benjamin braddock doppelganger a high tech mogul named beau burroughs an overly sedate kevin costner barely registers in a smallish role when he does there is an insinuating almost creepy quality in the way beau s relationship with sarah evolves until the end mark ruffalo has little to do as jeff but wait patiently for sarah to resolve her personal dilemma richard jenkins and mena suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of sarah s passive father and bubbly sister respectively the dvd provides the original theatrical trailer which gives away most of the plot as its sole extra 
unbelievable i hated this movie it was unrealistic and unbelievable also julia roberts is a horrible actress and more than slightly resembles an opossum 
not really for the beginner this tape really doesn t show you how to do all of the cuts listed in fact you don t ever see a complete groom from start to finish and all of the dogs are show dogs who stand perfectly still without the use of a grooming tether the tape also assumes a certain amount of knowledge about grooming and grooming tools she tells you the name of the tools but not why she choose them or which breeds to use them on i was expecting a step by step video including expert tips on grooming but it was more a show with occasional comments tossed out the groomer almost seemed bored with her job ! i purchased it so that our novice volunteers could learn about grooming but i don t see how it will help educate them we ll probably never use it 
duped duped duped duped ! i kept readin stuff about youll like this if you re into doc savage well i like doc savage and was not into this it was excruciatingly dull and probably the hardest film i ve ever made myself sit through to get my moneys worth and personally if it had just come on tv and i d never even heard of it i truly doubt i would have made a single doc savage connection duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuped 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
no good scenes in the whole movie this movie doesn t have a single scene worth watching femalien is in another league don t waste your time on the sequel 
save your read the book one of the last of the biblical epics this was a bomb in its initial release and deservedly so the movie doesnt know whether it is de mille or italian realism and most of the sequences adam eve tower of babel are either laughable or langorous george c scott ava gardner as abraham sarah yet stuck in the middle is a fine half hour sequence of the story of noah with director john huston casting himself in the one strong sequence in the movie replete with the right mix of humor and awe that half hour isnt enough to recommend buying or renting the dvd but if you can catch it on tv some day its worth a half hour of your life 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
doesn t live up to its promise i am an asian cinophile and i love suspense and action films i can also appreciate the asthetics of quiet space and subtlty this film really didn t move me on any of those levels however the eroticism was fleeting suspense soggy and drama weak not recommended 
christmas in connecticut very enjoyable i love the old movies the whole family can watch and it was a pleasure to watch barbara stanwyck and dennis morgan light and airy great for christmas 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
vampires los suckos this brainless low budget attempt to cash in on the success of john carpenter s vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn t even bribe one of their lap dog reviewers to crank out a glowing review for the dvd cover or maybe they couldn t afford the kickback who knows in any case the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over thecounter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that i used the dvd later to drain my spaghetti john carpenter presents a piece of incredible crap its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile 
oh god why i remember this movie being really really fun and great when i was my wife wanted this for our video collection and i hate myself for buying this movie all i need to know is why she wanted this today ! if you have kids which we do they ll enjoy this for the first time but after words they ll be as bored with it as i am if you are looking for nostalgia this is the movie but if you are looking for a good dust collector buy it quickly 
not good but what other choice do you have first of all i would like to start off by saying that this movie sucks here are a few of the things that supports my decision dacascos does not know capoeira he played the berimbau an insrument used in capoeira wrong he pronouced many of the terms incorrectly and he had no flow to his movements the acting was horrible while watching this you kind of get the picture that the director wanted to finish this movie a soon as possible most of the lines were just stupid dacascos character had no real history apparently had this mysterious past you really could care less about because the plot was so predictable the fighting was laughable at best capoeira is the only martial art that was outlawed for being so violent and unstoppable you don t need corny fight scenes to show it s usefulness most of the fight scenes where repeated movements that were shot at different angles dacascos was doing meia lua s a spinning kick in which both hands are on the ground as you strike that were knocking out three people at once in one ridiculous scene saverio the drug lord pointed to where he wanted dacascos to stand so that he could miraculously appear behind him and perform and unchallenged jumping kick to the back of his head i wish an experinced capoeirista would have done the fight scenes although this movie was horrible it is the only movie in which capoeira is suppose to be the main artform used while watching this movie one can only hope that this poor performance dosen t hurt capoeira s chances at being the cornerstone of another movie 
someone owes orwell an apology orwell s novel was about taking spectacular ideas about life and co operation and morphing it to fit your own greedy desires losing all purpose and ultimately ending in a futile corrupt dictatorship it made fun of dictators then and still makes fun of dictators today and though an easy read it went deep in speaking politically about man s actions against man sadly none of that is in this film in fact this movie is a travesty to the original novel one major problem is that it renders orwell s novel cute probably due to the release of all the animal films during this time babe gordy what have you old major s speech is a great speech and who better to perform it than peter ustinov unfortunately this speech is ruined by being talked over by julia louise dreyfus as the horse complaining that she will lose her ribbons if man is overthrown among other animals and their minor problems imagine katie couric talking over winston churchill s we will fight on the beaches speech and you ll understand how i feel it gets worst later on the main character is not the farm entire but instead a female dog that annoyingly whines and complains the whole time and tries to narrate what is going on does this sound bad it gets worst in the end she leads the animals out of the farm and then tells us everything lived happily ever after napoleon s animalism fails were never told how or see it happen they basically throw it at us and say take our word for it and then a white middle class family of four moves in and takes over the farm the end did orwell s point just fly past these people or what orwell was always a master of the closing line to me and animal farm is no exception even the british animated film managed to sneak in orwell s metaphor before closing with a happy ending this was such a waste peter ustinov as old major ian holm as squeeler patrick stewart as napoleon all these talented names being wasted sounds horrible but it is true such a great book with serious representation being treated in an amatuerish fashion may not bother some but for others it is a big deal if you like orwell if you loved the novel if you enjoy great stories and if you enjoy good films dont watch this movie 
seagal saves the day without doing many actions so boring when i saw so so actioner belly of the beast i thought steven seagal was well on the way to his comeback finally realizing that authentic looking martial arts actions are what gave him the stardom which is however fading away very fast now i saw this film and know i was terribly wrong his next film out of reach is a huge letdown probably the final nail in the coffin dont get me wrong i really like his films made in the s like under siege action packed escapism entertainment in out of reach steven seagal plays one billy ray lancing an ex agent living in the wilds of canada where he finds injured animals and bring them to health yet another embironmentally conscious hero from seagal but doesn t he see that these social messages have nothing to do with making good action films add to that billy ray exchanges letters with a little girl irena living in an orphanage in poland when it is reported that she is missing and a nasty businee of human traffic is suspected he travels there incognito secures a help from the local policewoman while he has no id speaks a bit of french and hits a pc keyboard like a pro better than a polish technichian to restore a secretly recorded image we meet a hissable baddie matt schultz but anyway we are sure seagal will win because he has taught the little girl how to decode the cyphers and check out how she uses it a scene which makes unexpectedly hilarious yougottabekiddin moment so how about the fact moving kicking and chopping once seagal s trademark no these thrilling martial arts actions are gone forever in this new film you just don t have actions in out of reach as i counted them well in the first minutes of out of reach you can see only two action set pieces in one seagal s hero billy breaks a few arms and legs of the unkind government agents about seconds and much later billy smashes the glass of hotel bathroom and drops an assassin onto a parked car another seconds that s it that s all there are more actions to come obligatory shoot outs and sword fights but not enough to call out of reach an action film the pace is terribly tedious the images when at night are too dark and worst of all not only seagal but slmost all the polish cast sleepwalk in the pedestrian story little girl looks bored while she is supposed to be in danger finally about director po chih leong fairly good in jude law s brooding thriller with a vampire theme the immortal who is the least likely choice in seagal s entire filmography to succeed in staging exciting actions and the results turned out as we feared the slow paced story is sleep inducing and what little action bits in the film are amateurish at best with poorly constructed shots in which fast editing attempts to conceal seagal is no longer moving his bodies like he used to do 
who s that knocking in the woods the tommyknockers is one of the more unsuccessful of stephen king adaptations to hit the screen originally a tv miniseries the movie suffers from lackluster direction mediocre performances and no sense of true suspense or horror typically set in a homey little new england town the plot centers on the discovery of a mysterious object in the woods by a local writer marg helgenberger who along with her alcoholic poet boyfriend a poorly cast jimmy smits decides to keep it a secret until the whole thing is unearthed meanwhile a ghostly green light emits from the object causing the townspeople to go bonkers in one form or another whether it be by inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around with glowing green eyes at three hours the tommyknockers definitely overstays its welcome and that is one problem in watching a miniseries in one take it can become redundant tighter direction and a more focused cast could have helped but aside from john ashton eg marshall and joanna cassidy in supporting roles most of the performances seem phone in and traci lords is ridiculously hilarious as the postal slut a real misfire 
my copy a dud having first seen this film at university twenty years ago i was really looking forward to watching this scary but masterful political propaganda film once again but my copy was a dud about minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies the images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued then the sound froze i had to keep fast forwarding to get through the glitches qa could not have been to rigorous the digital reproduction on the dvd is poor at this point and this continues throughout the whole of the ss review ill be asking for my money back 
stupid boring gross this movie is stupid beyond words i watched a half hour of it and could not watch any more i was so lost and bored makes no sense talks about creepy gross and disgusting things is boring and stupid don t waste time on this dull as dust film 
terrible this movie was terrible doesn t begin to explain it it s a vampire movie that follows none of the rules they don t have to be asked to let in no attacking them with silver or stake through the heart just shoot em up also the plot seems to randomly occur i would give it stars if possible 
extremely annoying if you like action flicks with absolutely no intelligence this movie will appeal to your deepest of hearts but for those of you who prefer a plot and something that makes at least a little sense skip it a sports camera crew sets out to find the most daring of extreme sports heroes so that it can film an action movie in the alps they recruit a couple of crazy snow boarders helicopter pilots willing to outrun avalanches and then they toss in a pretty and dainty olympic skier for good measure and some eye candy the entire film consists of the frilly skier competing with the fearless snow boarders for attention and film time they get thrown out of helicopters at high altitude without any oxygen and wearing barely any clothes but they never freeze funny how that happens in movies ! the real amazing feat is how they ski downhill in front of a major avalanche and can still talk to one another have you ever heard how loud an avalanche is thank goodness for those sub atomic hearing aids eventually european terrorists enter the picture and a few automatic weapons something has to encourage those slow moving avalanches well you know how it goes the action is great and if you like skiing some of the stunts are literally unbelievable but other than that i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone with half a brain because you will just be frustrated with all of the impossibilities and missed reasons for people to die i only watched it because i was forced into it by a couch potato with a remote 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
for lana clarkson fans only an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in and out of some skimpy outfits she s completely gorgeous but even she can t save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead 
read the book for the times this movie was made the acting is good i would love to see this same story done in more modern times where i believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life if you ve read the book this movie cuts out so much of what i loved in the book i wish not only that it would be done in modern times but i can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete if you have to choose between the book and the movie choose the book 
definitely not a comedy but it s an interesting approach at what people will do for money still i hated it john travolta was terrible as usual lisa kudrow who was the reason i watched this was so incredibly unlike her role on friends as she was a murderous goldigging nympho biatch who made you mad every time she was on screen i was very disappointed with her performance i can t believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a part the other supporting actors were no good either with the exception of bill pullman who was pretty funny as the i could give a damn about it cop the best thing about this movie though is the cute gullible waitress named wendy who s only on screen about five minutes throughout the entire film anyway skip this one it was just plain awful 
dumb story this is the most dumbest story i ve ever seen it does not make sense and waste of my time to watch it 
primarily focused on puppy socialization this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five yearold chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that s great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i don t recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books 
denzel saves this from running out of time denzel washington the manchurian candidate man of fire plays a police chief in banyan key fl where he is sleeping with sanaa lathan brown sugar who is married to dean cain tvs lois clark rat race and bascially lathan finds out she s dying and she has some many months to live which then she gives washington part of the money if she dies soon after lathan goes missing maybe dead and that s when the big kickaroo happens when someone frames him so washington goes around trying to correct things trying not to be caught for something he didnt do he also has a sexy cop partner played by eva mendes some fun in this including a hilarious john billingsley tvs angel white oleander high crimes as washington s beer drinking buddy and washington saves this from being a complete disaster there s also a nice sequence where washington falls out a window onto a balcony as it comes apart and he has to climb back up mendes is hot but she doesnt show anything here and casting lathan as the femme fatale was a big miscasting also starring nora dunn three kings the hebrew hammer sweet locations help to but the plot is weak 
for the cover not the film i watched both seven brides for seven brothers and its documentary making of and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers particulary the incredible tommy rall looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film i came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb i decided to purchase the film then i noticed the cover i thought is this what i think it is and clicked on see larger image yikes ! it is i have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational to say the least after just having placed hands are not for hitting on my wish list if warner bros decides to change the illustration on the cover then i ll consider buying it until then for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see i suggest you view the see larger image of the cover before you decide to buy 
chopped and ruined anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft in addition as was mentioned earlier minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the best scenes if you get my drift if you want to see the original film this is not it avoid at all costs 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
movie is fine download quality very poor this quality of this movie download is awful small screen big screen just gawdawful it suffers from false contouring during the darker scenes which make up most of the picture not a good online rental at all movie was probably fine as movies such as this go r 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
nothing to write home about the review on the cover of the dvd reads a snappy sexy thriller i must disagree this was the most unsexy and unthrilling movie i ve seen in a long time in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll it s almost comedic twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production the film s ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination my vote just okay nothing to write home about 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
warning waste of money i m trying to figure out what movie these other reviewers were watching i wasted my money so you won t waste yours it was so boring i skipped through most of it and deleted it way through 
swimming with sharks kevin spacey this film is beautifully acted by kevin spacey but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing it may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world but why inflict this depiction on the world i ask the story is cynical cruel and i found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch not a favourite 
unfunny this is pathetic vile language inept writing and silly casting worst this film just isn t funny it s a waste of gene wilder and harrison ford 
read the book instead this movie the story of a shocking long ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious elizabeth hurley s and sean penn s characters are laughable caricatures anita shreve s writings never disappoint read the book instead 
bedlam the bedlams that greet the current republican administration each morning for usa involvement in iraq have actually relegated this dvd to second rateit is obvious that the producers of this so called documentary are more likely to be fractious to mr bush in particular than accommodating to the american public at large it is also obvious that mr bush is not the type of person to succumb to self pitymr moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though in the meantime i can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind to unfold 
horrible i bought this as a gift for my nephew because i loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie i m very glad i screened it first the female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow boring and illogical i m not very pc with old movies but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits choose one of the other disney re releases instead there are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog 
cruel brittania britain circa tony blair is elected p m princess di perishes and the spice girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public this effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing to be fair the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is rather they are appealing and prove to be the film s lone redeeming factor the fault lies in the script that tries to do for the spice girls what a hard days night did for the beatles whereas the fab four s film was full of wit and cogent commentary on beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it s trying to say about the spice craze i was reminded more of the monkees head than i was of a hard days night lots of celeb cameos roger moore elton john et al that amount to naught oh well on to from justin to kelly 
ultra stylish modern day noir with a too convoluted story and a surprise twist they say brian de palma s femme fatale has a very tricky plot it is true that the plot has a big twist but i am not allowed to reveal it so let me only say this whether or not you like the film depends on the incredibly convoluted story i thought it is overcooked way too much for me to take but you might feel differently well but who can tell all i can say with confidence is that femme fatale is a noir or dark crime thriller that features a beautiful but dangerous woman laure rebecca romijn stamos at the cannes film festival and the scenes were shot during the real premier showing of eastwest laure and other robbers try to pull off a heist after outwitting other gangsters laure becomes another person named lily but how you might not believe me but she was so lucky that she could find an exact look alike of her and no one suspects the truth ! well seven years later laure is still doing this masquerading game successfully until one cameraman nicholas antonio baderas takes a photo of her face which makes the cover of a magazine now intrigues blackmails shootings etc ensue as the film s title suggests femme fatale has references to crime thrillers like double indemnity some might remember hitchcock s vertigo for the very obvious reason watching someone through a camera is a familiar theme to this genre rear window and brian de palma himself has used it several times in his career there are interesting details laure s hair repeated images and hidden meaning of water and clock for instance and there is even split screen signature technique of de palma like his previous films no i m not talking about mission to mars or mission impossible femme fatale needs repeated viewings but for the following two reasons i don t think many would watch it more than once one is the weakness of the acting of the leading lady rebecca romijn stamos i hear the contrary opinion about her and i confess that my judgment about acting is totally subjective but it is clear i think that she is no barbara stanwyck i am not saying that rebecca romijn stamos is not sexy she is but not good and seductive enough to call her femme fatale who can seduce a man and a woman alike yes look at the opening sequence where some might have guilty pleasure like me and the other reason is the twist that comes later in the film please see for yourself for all the smooth camerawork of de palma and the beautiful photography of thierry arbogast the fifth element and score of ryuichi sakamoto the last emperor i felt i was cheated in the end i never thought it is coming but is it my fault that i didn t expect it femme fatale has stylish images and good soundtrack but the script is too smart for its own good 
floozy boozy jessica gets her golden boy jessica lange won an oscar for this proof positive that some years are so bereft of strong performances they have to give it to somebody apart from that this is a silly exercise in anti government paranoia with a wasted tommy lee jones and not much else 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
crumb ripoff i started liking this movie i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal underground cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late if you like the depressing gritty wild fastpaced style of this movie check out the original master robert crumb toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of this is crap in noncomformity and dont say i didnt get it i just think hes being hugely self indulgent and this whole thing is an homage gone awry lacking the wit psychedelia and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly 
does not do the book justice wuthering heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion betrayal madness despair greed hatred and revenge it s not necessarily a pleasant read but always an engrossing one emily bronte s characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you ve finished the book modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the bronte sisters works into film and this is no exception the characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book juliet binoche and ralph fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today but this movie is a definite low point for both as heathcliff and catherine fiennes and binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland binoche s personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role the other characters are likewise lacking in realism only janet mcteer fares well she is fabulous as ellen dean even if the acting were better the story does not capture the essence of the book everything moves too quickly the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words sinead o conners appearance as emily bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary this film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it the wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part ugly and unflattering fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice this isn t it 
senseless and absurd sorry can t finish this garbage movie is this girl retarded or what watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all how and why the garbage collecting turned cow feeder young guy would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer there s no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath the girl didn t look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless what life was too boring then what started becoming natural born killer give me a break bone chilling you can always say that again but won t make me care a bit more 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs

what this movie definitely had the potential to be gteat the action scenes are pretty good but the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes the final fight did t work for me either and the very last scene i thought was pretty unnecessary did anyone really remember joey wong was in this movie by the time that the end came the commentary on the dvd was one of the better ones that i have heard from ric meyers

not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
hey this movie sucks more time could have been spent in ney york city for this movie like with friday the th part seven the new blood all of the good gore scenes were cut out but still this is a terrible movie and i am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five 
a lot of green light and not much else rule number one if you re making a stephen king movie especially if it s a tv movie make it scary or don t make it at all ! the tommyknockers fails to do this miserably ! for most of the film you re watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions granted that s all in the book but it written chillingly by king in a way only he can do it there are some exciting alien moments at the end but by then it s too late you ve just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an x files episode on the plus side i had no problem watching the infamous traci lords act like like a total slut ! bless her 
interesting when i saw the first quotits alive quot movie in the theatre when i was it scared me so bad i couldn t sleep alone for nights funny when i saw it the other night i could not figure out what scared me it is such a funny movie the cinematography is extremely bad but i guess it was good for or whenever it first came out this movie is not as good as the first and i m going to watch the third tonight i m expecting it to be equally bad 
not for young kids i saw this movie a long time ago and had forgotten all but the basic plot i recently purchased the dvd thinking it would be a fun movie for my younger kids and to watch also it was rated pg so i thought it would be pretty safe i was wrong while the plot is innocent enough the language was atrocious i couldn t believe this thing was rated pg and not at least pg be advised that if you don t want your kids to hear a lot of cursing throughout a movie then this is not for you 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service

a waste if you have any respect for the blues legend don t buy this don t even rent it the very few decent tribute performances do not make up for the lack of content in this dvd pointless interviews and speeches make for annoying filler when all we really want is the music especially disappointing is the performance by weir wasserman they rattle off a an aimless and depthless quotwalkin blues quot you can t help but feel that wasserman would rather be somewhere else most irritating is the claim that this so called conference quotfoundquot a quotvery rare quot film clip of the man himself it is presented to a lecture hall audience to which robert johnson s son was a part when asked by the speaker if the man playing guitar was indeed robert johnson he said clearly quotnoquot quotummmare you sure quot quotyesquot quotohwell so it may not be him but is certainly looks like him quot why was this even included here if it s not footage of robert johnson then why didn t it wind up on the cutting room floor bleah

another overrated underachieving unimpressive french film this movie epitomizes the sub genre of french films which is to say it engenders every tired stereotype of what makes some french films either unwatchable or unenjoyable the other type of films from france or by french directors including jean pierre juinet luc besson etc who have a good sense of pacing and action and frenetic mood to explain my statement about stereotypical french films the movies in question consistently consist of stilted drama unlikable characters who do not have much use for the concept of understatement or indoor voice whose lives are always immersed in melodrama whether or not circumstances warrant it these films also do not seem to place much value in pacing and indeed regard a slow and plodding progression as an indication of depth and thought even if such elements are not evident something else that seems troubling about french film if not the culture itself is the seemingly nonchalant attitude about physical coercion in sexual encounters in more than one interview gerard depardieu has cavalierly waxed nostalgic about participating in gang rapes during his teen years correspondingly this film has more than one occasion of where a teenage girl is assaulted and in each case the matter is regarded with minor if any attention at best there is also the inveterately disfunctional interactions between all parties in this film as is so common as it turns out hardly of the characters are particularly likable or sympathetic the father was conveyed as a marginally sympathetic character at the end until his encounter with lise one thing i will give the french credit for is that they do not feel compelled towards using formulaic predictable happy endings aside from this the title has an apt metaphor in the plot that has been mentioned in other reviews however i was not very impressed with the film for the plodding execution and other reasons listed i didn t think the movie was completely terrible but i also think it wasn t very strong barely stars additionally both the film s synopsis and several other sources are guilty of misleading descriptions regarding the so called erotic sensual nature of the girls relationship if this is why you are renting it you will be very disappointed otherwise if you are an unremitting francophile or praiser of foreign films you will find some excuse to laud this film if for no other reason than your need to 
very irreverant remake of a disney icon i am appalled at the greed that disney must have to milk out a classic like the absent minded professer i found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie i found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by robin williams and marsha gay hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that s throughout all disney movies or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves i also feel that with the character of flubber it was a waste of time considering i don t remember any merchandising from the character they should ve stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original i also feel that with the promotion of the flubber substance that it was all shallow and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military and here it was to make a buck i feel that there are some movies that are best to just be left in original state and not be remade and this is one of them 
painful from the cover this movie looked like a fun mixture of cruel intentions and metropolitan no such luck i think the biggest problem in this movie was the script the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue though there are some normally fine actors in this cast it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion except for a few moments of melodrama i found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with delilah who is supposed to be the fun crazy outsider simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie s central party even the art direction in this movie was strange many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away the strangeness of this movie is not intentional it s just lack of skill stay away 
slice of life i ve seen the phrase slice of life used many times to describe this movie which makes me wonder whose life is this a slice of certainly not mine and not most people s the anniversary party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain self absorbed jaded and rich beyond most people s wildest fits of imagination worse there isn t much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people or at least most people who are fun to be around don t act the way these characters do good films can be made about hollywood in mulholland drive it s kind of a dream world both in the sense that it s hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it in state and main the self absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement the anniversary party is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters but i can t imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who isn t also a bored rich prick if this is truly a slice of life for the hollywood set it is no wonder that so many films produced in hollywood are so cynical and shallow 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
what this movie was so stupid everyone listens to nina when she is clearly messing with their lives they are stupid enough to believe her and well i don t even know what else happens cause i saved myself and changed the channel 
hang me from my neck until i m dead if i ever a subject myself to this movie ever againorb subject anyone else including animals to this movieform a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review just one question that still haunts me how does travolta s career survive this debacle and pepper s hits the tank 
davy crockett tv vs davy crockett movies i was very gung ho when i found out that disney was finally releasing the davy crockett tv show on dvd i grew up watching the two davy crockett movies however upon actually seeing these dvds i was very disappointed it is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes the episodes davy crockett indian fighter davy crockett goes to congress and davy crockett at the alamo are all the parts included in the movie davy crockett king of the wild frontier the episodes davy crockett s keelboat race davy crockett and the river pirates were what made up the movie davy crockett and the river pirates i for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in that is just the two movies on one disc the only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy leonard maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector s box the biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between whereas you can buy the two movies on dvd for i myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
just a bit too much barry longyear s story is perfect this movie could have been but what was that bull at the end with the whips and factory slaves and that stuff they should have ended the movie as the story ended and not added that last bit that totally ruined the movie for me the novella and its sequel at least give humanity the benefit of a doubt the war is over and there is an uneasy peace and humanity if love doesn t prevail at least strives to be better in the movie they made humans brutal savages in the way they treated the dracs did we learn nothing from the usa s foray into slavery and brutality it seemed that a violent ending was gratuitously grafted onto the movie to make it more palatable to the year old testosterone crown thereby destroying what could have been as perfect a film as the novella was perfect but when has hollywood ever gotten it right they usually find some way to shoot themselves in the foot 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
it was so boring that i could scream this line spoken by julie christie to dirk bogarde in darling just about sums up my feelings towards this movie although i am halfway done with this movie i think this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen and i am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing i am done with this movie believe it or not and it only got worse christie s character diana scott marries an italian man who hello is old enough to be father ! and oh yes he s an aging prince in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to grace kelly and what would happen to jacqueline kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her princess diana almost made me laugh that nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my tv a la elvis presley considering that this is the same setup that occurs in georgy girl and that is spoiled british girl living in swinging england marries older man three words anna nicole smith also i would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that christie deserved the oscar for best actress she didn t at all because it should and i mean should of gone to julie andrews for the sound of music my pick for the best movie of the s because not only did she overtake her performance of mary poppins for which she won the oscar she pulverized every performance by a female that year including christie and there s a problem with the academy they can t seem to pull the trigger in giving back toback oscars to the same person im not alone in this arugment in danny perry s book alternate oscars he picks andrews for best actress of and states that the reason why the ampas gave the oscar to christie was not because it was the british invasion but they saw it as a way to give an oscar to christie s other film doctor zhivago which was t som s rival and added to the fact that zhivago had no acting nominations there s another oscar problem they don t know when to be hip also does it seem like dirk bogarde and lawrence harvey were the two worst actors in film history because it seems to me that every movie that i have seen with them are bad weather it was this movie or the manchurian candidate with harvey or modesty blaise with bogarde in conclusion i think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an oscar or as what bogarde said to christie a fitting way to close this review since that i end where it begins i don t take taxis that are filled with whores ! 
good music too hard to follow for beginners i will admit that paula is inspirational but she doesn t give you enough time to learn the move before putting you in full gear i loved the music and paula s upbeat personality but felt it moved way too fast this video will definitely get your heart a pumpin 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
not worth the time save your money this is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic i hadn t read the book before seeing the movie the film stunk a few years later i read the book and was enchanted i did not make the connection that this was the same story until i saw the film again on late night tv i was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen then i realized what movie it was i tried to sit through it i just couldn t the monster should have eaten the film 
midly entertainitng but a bit off parts of this story are entertaining but parts of it tended to bother me what really bothered me was that harriet did some mean things to people in her class but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong she seemed to tell harriet to pretend to be sorry even if she wasn t sorry that attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book 
exit the freeway this movie was loaned to me thank god i did nt rent it and is the biggest waste of a few hours of my life ever ! the acting is so horrible it made me cringe and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv this is supposed to be a black comedy it s not funny and the so called violence in it made me yawn seriously i ve seen more gore on the simpsons there are so many things in the movie that are amazingly unbelievable k sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through his neck head and two in the back r witherspoon overpowers sutherland for the second time and strangles him pretty good for a pound teenage girl huh but i do think everybody should watch this movie once so you can see what a movie should not be besides misery loves company 
the details are wrong the big picture is inexistant the details are all fine if you don t know the middle east but are not well researched and inconsistent i won t bore you with the list all the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake tell us something new the overall storyline does not have much else going for it i was expecting more intrigue a more synthesized story line a disappointment 
not the japanese series i just would like to thank the person from seattle wa who discovered that this dvd is not the one that airs on the food network which is what my husband and i love like the reviewer from seattle i agree that amazon should provide more information regarding dvd because i would have been seriously upset to receive what i thought was the japanese version only to see william shatner yuck 
jazzman a very deplorable highly offensive insensitive profane and depressing piece of garbage the dialogue is jaw dropping embarrassing and so horrible you want to coveryour ears also very pretentious and unrealistic justwhat kind of people enjoy watching crap like this theonly positive thing i ever got from this film was thesoundtrack by gato barbieri the great jazz saxophonist i wanted to smack the s out of that wimp french boy friend of schneider s brando s not much of a man in thiseither an artsy fartsy work for the new york la filmschool crowd i suppose give me cool hand luke thankyou

controversy not quality it was probably brave to make any sort of a film out of rudi van danzig s book doubtless the controversial part of the subject matter of this film an year old boy part willingly seduced by a year old soldier was the reason that it was awarded the best film and audience prize at turin in it cannot have been for any artistic merit or general craft competence when jeroen and his mother emerge from their flat we are expected to believe that this is amsterdam after more than years of nazi occupation and deprivation the flats and street are in immaculately good condition the children being packed off to friesland so that rest of their families shan t starve are pictures of good health was the budget for this film so pathetically low that the producers could not drive around the netherlands coastline to find a village for the arrival of the canadian liberators where there weren t bollards on the footpaths to stop people parking cars there doubtless mcdonald s was just around the corner i laughed i thought of monty python as to the main topic of the film the relationship between the soldier and the boy do not expect this to remain totally from the child s perspective as it is in the book there are trite lines of self explanation from the soldier the book quite believably develops the relationship between the child and the man the film doesn t since the film is only minutes long perhaps the answer is a censor s sharp scissors not an example of the film makers overall artistic failure or perhaps they just hadn t got enough money for enough scenes the small redeeeming part of the film is the depiction of the devoutly protestant people of this ultra provincial part of the netherlands i believed this representation in this the film shares it s small success with another poor film set in an extreme end of a maritime country which relies on sex to get people to watch it breaking the waves do not expect this film to bear more than a passing resemblance to van dantzig s book do not expect to see a work of art don t waste your money on this dvd instead if you haven t done so already buy the book

whiny slackers poke reality with stick reality bites back reality bites seemed fresh when it was first released giving voice to a generation with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of x that was overeducated underemployed plagued by the flashy trashy commercialism of mtv and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college it was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass cruel arena of materialism can be tough providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth the very stuff of real movies instead we have a swan dive into a pizza hut commercial held together by a plot so shop worn it would have been considered exhausted in winona ryder is winning as lelaina but one can only imagine the sats of football players at a college where she is valedictorian her documentary is appallingly narcissistic reflecting the characteristic gen x notion that if it s about me it s art and it s important ethan hawke does an excellent job as troy the very archetype of self satisfied supercilious entitlement we are expected to root for him but it s hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus stiller who directed a talented fellow almost impossible to look at plays michael the antitroy smooth successful and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of gen x culture if culture is the right word he s an executive at an mtv ish corporation that he improves lelaina s preposterous documentary rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity is the film s dirty little secret viewers surprised by who wins lelaina s hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and liberace was gay indeed when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie janeane garofalo is outstanding as always and john mahoney shines as the tv morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact a bastard his performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film or on tv than the rest of this film put together in fact reality is great this picture would have benefited from some 
forgettable western this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it isn t what a shame it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense buy or rent on your own if you dare i wouldn t 
far from eisenstein s finest hour alexander nevsky may be an eisenstein film but that doesn t make it any less cheesy in fact it makes some of those italian peplum look substantial by comparison with it s crude stereotyping and propaganda as the russian people rise to save their homeland in defiance of the capitalist and aristocratic oppressors of the people and do battle with the baby burning papist germans how stalin ever signed the ribbentrop molotov pact after this hatchet job is a mystery much of the filming is as clumsy as the characterization with obvious painted backdrops clumsy medieval speak dialog constant reversion to silent moviemaking techniques at their least compelling and a tendency to go for height in the image to such an extent that the action is often barely clinging to the bottom of the frame it s reputation rests on prokofiev s dreary score and the spectacular battle on the ice although both are a mixture of the good the bad and the downright lazy only moments in the aftermath of the battle retain any real potency 
davy crockett tv vs davy crockett movies i was very gung ho when i found out that disney was finally releasing the davy crockett tv show on dvd i grew up watching the two davy crockett movies however upon actually seeing these dvds i was very disappointed it is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes the episodes davy crockett indian fighter davy crockett goes to congress and davy crockett at the alamo are all the parts included in the movie davy crockett king of the wild frontier the episodes davy crockett s keelboat race davy crockett and the river pirates were what made up the movie davy crockett and the river pirates i for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in that is just the two movies on one disc the only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy leonard maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector s box the biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between whereas you can buy the two movies on dvd for i myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately 
taboo porn this movie has nothing to do with a house its really just a low budget rape porn i tossed it in the trash about minutes into it 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
a bad movie with some redeaming qualities ok so claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work yes the martial arts are weak at best but i still own this movie and watch it just to see raul julia go over the top why do they still call me a warlord and mad all i want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier not for power not for evil but for good carlos blanka will be the first of thousands they will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary every creed every nation ! until the world is in the loving grip of the pax bisonica and peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude 
sterile derivative and plastic just like hollywood and just like the music industry which i guess is the point john travolta playing on his character from get shorty and to a lesser degree like his character in pulp fiction and swordfish is mr cool this time he s trying to make it big in the music biz he discovers a new talent artist christina milian and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters a brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar the dialogue seems forced funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae aside from a few interesting moments only one speech toward the end made by cedric the entertainer redeemed the film its like a big commercial which i suppose is any hollywood film certain musicians get shameless plugs steven tyler and aerosmith included in the film various movies get shameless plugs including in a not so disguised fashion get shorty certain hollywood landmarks eg the mann chinese theater are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the l a lakers and the staples center get a plug its an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or in this case making a musician so we watch travolta as mr cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give christina milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts the ending is so horribly cheesy i felt as if i was watching american idol watchable but barely the player covered this terrain so much better 
some movies better not be rewatched this comment may contain spoilers when i first saw liliana cavani s controversial film about sadomasochistic love affair between former nazi officer max dirk bogard and a concentration camp survivor lucia charlotte rampling whom he used to abuse sexually and physically during the wwii it had a shock value i saw it in moscow in the middle of s and when our friends brought the tape to watch i thought it was a screen adaptation of the irwin shaw s novel nightwork which is a completely different story both were translated to russian as the night porter hence the confusion as you can see the film had a triple shocking value for me first i expected to see a different movie second and third for its dark and disturbing subject matter and for the breaking all kinds of taboos in the way cavani had explored it i remember that i was very impressed by cavani s use of flashbacks music and her classy cinematography both leads were very good as two people who had met at the most horrifying circumstances but according to the writer director were not able to forget the disturbing relationship and were willing to give anything just to be able to carry on with it it was a first time i saw charlotte rampling and she became one of my favorite actresses i saw it again couple of weeks ago and i have to admit that without its original shock value it did not impress me at all the plot does not seem that shocking the story does not make much sense some of the dialog is just ridiculous for example max confesses to his old friend countess stein who knows everything about his past after lucia had entered his hotel and his life max i found her i found my little girl countess such a romantic story max it is not a romantic story it is a biblical story the second part of the movie when the couple try to hide in max s apartment and the other nazi wait outside for days for them to come out is just bad imo the final scene is plausible and makes sense there could be never a happy ending to the story like that but alas it took too long for the ending to come i actually could not wait for somebody to finally take the unfortunate couple out of their misery and i was grateful when it happened not a good sign for the movie where you should sympathize with the main characters i am not sure if the movie is one of nazi chic flicks or a serious and honest even if flawed exploration of the very dark depths of human soul it sure has the characteristics of both 
night life song replaced the most memorable part of this film was the dance scene to night life which would repeat through the movie this version credits the song but it was replaced with some lame disco music i am writing mgm to complain and demand a refund even the trailer has the right music playing all through it demand the original 
one of the dumbest movies that i ve ever seen back in the early s jane march made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit the lover granted the role didn t give her much to work with but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers including me the movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring board into a legitimate movie career unfortunately choosing the unbelievably stupid bruce willis vehicle color of night as her follow up probably killed any chance at a career that she had ive always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre most of the ones that i ve seen while sexually explicit aren t really erotic nor are they thrilling in any way this movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of basic instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar as a result we ended up with some terrible films like sliver jade body of evidence and this film color of night the plot goes something like this bruce willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window going splat on the sidewalk below he is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red he decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by scott bakula and hanging out with scott s therapy group he hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened scott s group is a motley crew of screwed up people from a woman who is nymphomaniac to a weird androgynous young boy bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable jane march and he quickly falls in love with her we get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool the bedroom the bathtub and the shower meanwhile someone murders scott bakula and starts to wreck havoc with bruce he tries to figure out if it s someone in scott s therapy group and on and on and so forth the movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious bruce willis was apparently taking this movie virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances but bruce seemed to think that this might be an oscar contender add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension and add way too many red herrings and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch about the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit but decidedly unerotic sex scenes they really come across as more silly than anything else the only thing that i enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older jane march in the buff and looking better than ever what a smoking body but like i mentioned before she got a lot of the blame along with bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result she has appeared in very few movies since i still think that if she had been given the proper chance she could have been a great actress but people have all but forgotten about her by now its really surprising that this movie didn t kill bruce willis career but i guess if he could survive hudson hawk bonfire of the vanities he could survive anything btw the version i watched was listed as being the rrated director s cut with additional steamy minutes added back into the film since i never saw the original cut i couldn t tell what might have been added back into this version there is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal bruce willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that s too strong avoid this movie like it was herpes color of night is rated r and contains strong sexual content nudity graphic violence and strong language 
another lame shark movie bad acting and bad effects make this movie awful this movie was a little intresting but could have been way way better they coppied the same scenes from shark attack and showed them over and over when lots of great white sharks are killing tons of people at a beach resort its up to wagner to kill them it got pretty borring and made me want to go to sleep im warning you do not see this movie 
a very late review of riverdance the show i m not the sort to give things a bad review because it is cool and trendy way too old for that but i have to say that i am glad i checked this video out at the rental store before buying really it s quite bad not that the dancing isn t phenomenal michael rules ! but it lacks soul hubby and i like celtic music old shepherds hey fans and we get to see celtic dancing locally though amateur and we both found this video disappointing the principal problem is the homogenization of the singing it is sort of celtic music for elevators the second problem is the flamenco dancer having seen a top rank group from spain at wolftrap i have to say that this lady has got no attitude and the music please don t get me started two stars could have used a plot could have used some edge to both the singing and dancing lots of people adore this video but if you are a fan of traditional irish dance and song you might want to rent first 
you might need to watch this one twice it starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end and about through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion 
fine historic rendition filmed in this movie is in black and white and might be considered dull and slow moving by today s standards an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research 
eh ive seen worse if you want a review of the plot itself complete with spoilers feel free to read the other reviews my biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed again and again due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn t keep the story straight there is a homage to asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm that would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film there are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible that said it was a bit enjoyable the cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given if the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked maybe i would have cared what happened to them the dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say oooh cool good premise good effects good acting but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film 
definitely not recommended i m afraid that the reviewers who didn t like this movie understood it all too well at times it promises real drama and tension but never delivers there are too many character twists with no basis and the ending really does make the viewer feel cheated this is a really poor attempt at making a movie 
revolting this movie is very difficult to watch after awhile its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all i didn t laugh through any of the movie i love dark comedies like election heathers to die for etc but this just didn t work for me i hated it so much i returned it lied and said it was a gift don t even rent it horrendous 
a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon as a fan of mme austen thomas hardy d h lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner i freely admit to a hopeless addiction to period pieces and romances in particular and this weakness clearly plays into the very generous aforementioned star rating northanger abbey is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon but please don t expect this movie to be anything like the big money hollywood adaptations of mme austen s other works the acting is over thetop the soundtrack deplorable and the characters with the exception of eleanor are completely unsympathetic catherine is portrayed as an insipid half wit rather than a day dreamy post adolescent on the verge of womanhood peter firth s henry tilney vascilates between compassionate brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance by the end of the movie i had lost all patience with them and was convinced that henry catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other this from a romance buff most will give up before the end of the film but true austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes witty repartee and the opportunity to daydream about the regency culture watch it or don t but if you choose to watch make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
not the same when pokemon first debuted i thought it would rock and misty brock and ash would stay together as a gang forever and ash would love it to just be walking around the world earning badges etc and that s the way it would stay maybe even ash and misty would fall in love ! but nope the dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive pokemon cards and the animation is just getting cheaper this movie is totally different from the original movies and the tv series and it sucks i ll hold on to the older series and dvd s but nowadays brock and misty are gone and it s just boring without them for those who agree with me get the message out there that pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks bring back brock and misty it will save the series ! oh and i m only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous with so much change and so little things the same boo 
terrible i used to like this film back in the late s but after purchasing it reading the book and watching it again i realized that there isn t much to say that is redeeming of this film sure it s low budget but the story and characters are so cheesy and not in a good b movie way i guess this film will still have it s fans but after reading the book i dont normally compare books to films because its downright impossible to compare i found the characters just not that likeable and the ending is very ridiculous for a film to achieve cult status isn t too hard if its a b movie but whether its a good film or not is the real question as for me i rate this low because i find it atrocious but for it s fans the ones out there that really love this film and call it a classic i must say i hope some day they remake the story with better actors effects and plotting 
historically important but a very unorthodox uneven film rudolf nureyev and margot fonteyn no other ballet partnership is as legendary the fiery russian defector and the graceful aging english ballerina formed a bond on and off the stage that for several years practically defined romantic ballet thus for this very reason hardcore balletomanes should get this dvd many of us including me were too young to have seen nureyev and fonteyn live so these videos are the only example to dissect the legendary partnership however caveat emptor this is not a typical swan lake by any means you can argue that there is no typical swan lake the original production in was a failure some of the music went missing after tchaikovksy s death the choreographers marius petipa and lev ivanov restaged swan lake and that version more or less is the swan lake audiences know today there s lots of music so most versions of swan lakeuse the traditional pieces nevertheless there are some different traditions of swan lake in the russian productions the outcome is usually happy rothbart is killed and siegfried and odette are alive in the productions used everywhere else odette and siegfried leap into the lake and are reunited in the otherworld i prefer the second ending personally because i think it better matches both the story the happy ending was enforced by the tsar and seems tacked on and the music as well rudolf nureyev s film however is unlike any other swan lake i ve ever seen first of all from the opening closeup of siegfried in blue eyeshadow and red lipstick you realize this film is not going to follow balanchine and classical ballet s creed of ballet is woman the first act is redesigned to incorporate a lot of solos and dance opportunities for siegfried nureyev the first act usually ends with siegfried picking up his bow and arrow and going hunting with benno in this film there is a long elegiac solo for siegfried using music that s usually used in act nureyev even dares to tinker with the famous act ii choreography by lev ivanov in the famous odette siegfried adagio the melody is not repeated with the cello instead there s another solo for siegfried margot fonteyn was born in so it s possible that the emphasis on nureyev is due to fonteyn s technical limitations at the time and one notices that fonteyn as graceful and lovely as she is is at times unable to cope with the famously demanding odette odile role for instance odette s solo in act ii usually ends with a series of turns and then odette stands on pointe and holds a balance before going into the wings fonteyn doesn t attemptthe feat but ends the series of turns in first position flat on her feet fonteyn by modern standards also lacks the athleticism bonelessness her arms always look like arms not wings flamboyance and flexibility that one usually associates with this role act iii s music choreography is pretty standard but the musical arrangements and choreography for the black swan pas de deux are radically different fonteyn actually churns out the fouettes confirming something i ve long suspected that everyone looks at the fouettes but odette odiles real challenges are the balances footwork and leaps and this is where you can see fonteyn suffer strangely act iv the act that is usually cut to shreds is the most intact and it s the best danced act it s the reconciliation scene between odette and siegfried that one can catch glimmers of the genuine bond that existed between these dancers elsewhere the technical limitations of fonteyn by this time and nureyev s reworking of swan lake as a solo showpiece for siegfried distracted me from simply enjoying their partnership i particularly loved when siegfried runs all over the stage turning up the head of each swan to find his odette and when he finally finds margot s head it s a truly beautiful moment the ending of nureyev s version follows the original swan lake and not the usual endings of the swan boat to heaven on a technical level there are problems the ballet was filmed on a soundstage and seems way too small to fit a whole cpmpany corps as a result the dancers often look haplessly cramped and as if they ll bump into each other the close bunching also detracted from the natural geometric shapes that are so much apart of classical ballet the vienna state ballet also looks woefully underreheased either that or they re just bad their legs are terribly uneven in arabesques their arms are a mess and they simply look like a corps that hasnt danced swan lake enough the sets are also deliberately artificial and the costuming espeically for nureyev and in the color acts is garish rothbart redbeard here is a non dancing role unlike in most productions when he s a smooth pimp type in act iii for a traditional swan lake with a more modern odette odile i d suggest the makarova dowell dvd with the royal ballet makarova was at the time of filming but her long extensions boneless arms exquisite balances and still impressive technique make her odette odile much more appealing to modern tastes this swan lake is of great historical value and fonteyn is undeniably lovely but overall i admit i wanted a more traditional swan lake and i certainly wouldnt recommend this dvd as anyone s first swan lake its just too unorthodox 
some of the worst acting i ve seen in my entire life when the lead character acts like she s sleepwalking through the entire film that s distracting ! when just about anyone from my high school s drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth then it s time to open up the wallet and hire better talent once you get past the special affects all which use cheesy models this godforsaken movie is boring as sin or should i say mud beside being preposterous for example the meteroid or whatever only hits a dam in its first strike this pitiful film is also delusional ! remember the scene where the head of fema risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire as hurricane katrinia proves there is no such thing as a bureaucratic administrator hero ! instead this movie comes off as a piece of not sosubtle federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
stars it s like watching a recruitment video for the kkk filled with errors i counted factual errors aka lies during michael moore s opening speech i stopped shortly after im not going to waste my time on such obviously factually wrong fiction how stupid does mr moore think we are i was there watching the election unfold and what he reported is not what happened example he said fox news pressured nbc cbs abc and cnn to change their minds and give florida to gore and then bush what a load of lies fox news has no power over the other nets nbc cbs abc cnn operate independently and reached their decisions independently without influence from fox and furthermore the other nets did not call for bush as moore falsely claimed they labeled florida undecided and left it that way for several days also moore claimed that a recount showed gore won florida false a bipartisan committee counted the votes a few months later and not only did bush win but the recount increased his lead from a few hundred to several thousand because of conservative communities in western florida many other non biased groups found the same result this video reminds me of his columbine documentary where men s ties kept changing colors in the middle of their speeches its called creative editing moore has no ethics propagandist as far as i m concerned he s no better than a kkk member same mental disorder illogic 
angela bettis needs to be stopped after seeing this i wanted to snatch my eyeball out of the sockett it was so stupid i thought angela bettis was through torturing us after her horrible remake of carrie but i guess not if you re lonely buy a dog or try keeping a boyfriend and not scaring him off but by no means do you begin to start killing people off and sewing their body parts together to make you a friend this chick was seriously messed up at any rate i see all the rave reviews and i don t understand it but i guess i don t share the morbid imaginations afterall i wouldn t be surprised if this turns out to be a cult classic i just didn t like it though 
did they read the book while not one of his best novels tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time ! jimmy smits does his best but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble skip it 
goodtimes dvd bad picture quality after reading a couple of other reviews about the quotqualityquot of transfer on this dvd i decided i wanted this in my collection what i thought would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality i was very dissapointed the quality of transfer of the picture is horrible a great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality non anamorphic deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered picture tones are very very bad along with what little color that is desplayed almost a black amp white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv it still was so dark it almost wasn t worth continue watching the only things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and quotsuppossedlyquot in dolby digital ex the beginning dolby intoduction was deffinatly in dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn t distributeand dolby sounds that i could make out on my theatre sound system sounded like mono to me thsi dvd reproduction stinks and i suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this quotgoodtimes video quot version untill it is put on dvd correctly why they botherd is beyond me because i wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen i am taping it on to vhs for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow i suppsoe i ll have to be content that i got the widscreen version on vhs for now untill they re release it on dvd with better quality or they show it on tv in widescreen which i highly doubt heck even taping it off tv you d get a better picture quality than this dvd 
heartburn is the least of the ills caused by this movie a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron s husband jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull 
old documentary please think this dvd is recorded in more worse this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of quotcompanyquot same worst sound quality documentary i suspect the word quotconcertquot or quotsoundtrackquot in dvd title 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
it was so boring that i could scream this line spoken by julie christie to dirk bogarde in darling just about sums up my feelings towards this movie although i am halfway done with this movie i think this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen and i am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing i am done with this movie believe it or not and it only got worse christie s character diana scott marries an italian man who hello is old enough to be father ! and oh yes he s an aging prince in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to grace kelly and what would happen to jacqueline kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her princess diana almost made me laugh that nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my tv a la elvis presley considering that this is the same setup that occurs in georgy girl and that is spoiled british girl living in swinging england marries older man three words anna nicole smith also i would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that christie deserved the oscar for best actress she didn t at all because it should and i mean should of gone to julie andrews for the sound of music my pick for the best movie of the s because not only did she overtake her performance of mary poppins for which she won the oscar she pulverized every performance by a female that year including christie and there s a problem with the academy they can t seem to pull the trigger in giving back toback oscars to the same person im not alone in this arugment in danny perry s book alternate oscars he picks andrews for best actress of and states that the reason why the ampas gave the oscar to christie was not because it was the british invasion but they saw it as a way to give an oscar to christie s other film doctor zhivago which was t som s rival and added to the fact that zhivago had no acting nominations there s another oscar problem they don t know when to be hip also does it seem like dirk bogarde and lawrence harvey were the two worst actors in film history because it seems to me that every movie that i have seen with them are bad weather it was this movie or the manchurian candidate with harvey or modesty blaise with bogarde in conclusion i think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an oscar or as what bogarde said to christie a fitting way to close this review since that i end where it begins i don t take taxis that are filled with whores ! 
great movie do not buy this dvd carwash is a classic film in its own genre however the dvd version is cut if you watch the television broadcast version such as on bet black entertainment television you will see the original scenes that were in the original theater version for instance the scene with danny devito in a jealous rage with his wife is not on the dvd nor is the hooker watching the apology the extended bus scene and not even the touching ending with marsha melanie mayron i strongly encourage you to act on this dvd deciet by contacting universal dvd manufacturing universal city plaza universal city ca you can t email them because they don t recognize carwash in their online library another note the widescreen addition is not widescreen 
city of angels was way better save your dvd rental fee if you re looking for a movie that will make you feel like city of angels made you feel look elsewhere ! sorry my vote is for hollywood the director of wings admits that there was no script before shooting began the extras that came with the wings dvd interviews and info on berlin were more entertaining than the movie 
there s got to be a morning after please the most surprising aspect of this thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes it is almost a half hour shorter than its predecessor a blessing really given that director wolfgang peterson seems only interested in filming the action sequences an inspired choice for the remake the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped seafaring adventures with his classic wwii submarine movie das boot and the more recent fishing trip gonewrong the perfect storm the offsetting problem however is that mark protosevich s trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses the net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked no matter how dire the consequences peterson wastes little time barely fifteen minutes in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave from that point he combines predictably spectacular cgi effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety the one indisputable improvement over the original is the way peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods but the set up gets repetitive and the only diversion albeit a minor one is figuring out which character will be killed next as the alpha male josh lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the gene hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler relegated to second lead kurt russell seems to be inheriting ernest borgnine s role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of new york huh they argue periodically about what path to take but that s the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film with no one as colorful as shelley winters or stella stevens this time the rest of the actors barely register including wide eyed emmy rossum playing russell s conflicted daughter and jacinda barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son the biggest waste is the normally colorful richard dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts the climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities and then it simply ends there are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects the two disc dvd is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several making of featurettes and a history channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc surprisingly there is little reference to the inspiration directed by ronald neame and consequntly there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs an unmemorable viewing experience overall

disappointing in more ways than as a remake it s not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick clean near perfect minimalist thriller it s not that much of the added material particularly the internal affairs sub plot feels tacked on and unnecessary it s not even that pacino s character is a toned down shell of the dangerously off kilter detective of the original that one of the more complicated characters frya selmer tanya francke has been reduced down to set dressing or that the ending ruins the film s moral atmosphere it s the fact that nolan a sublimely talented director is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads pacino does the method acting bit again taking it over the top in every single scene hilary swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down toearth hometown girl and robin williams well he s robin williams the kids in this film katharine isabelle and jonathan jackson turn in fine performances that while hardly career makers which they couldn t be considering how far their roles have been pared down are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries mugging see the film for their far tooshort performances but make sure you rent it and don t pay too much to do so 
i love to dance i m writing this for my seven year old grandaughter she loves this dvd she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star i love watching her enjoy this dvd ! 
he was fired from gm for calling off and showing up late what a joke people believe the stupidest things do some research and you will see that this is a joke i hated it 
great movie bad dvd can t add much to the discussion about the movie but wanted to say that this dvd listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of school daze it says it has both full screen and widescreen but it doesnt 
maybe a good film but not a true story warning spoilers there are so many reviews saying this is a true story i have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real obviously about everything else is dramatized including the mission objectives scud hunting on foot which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today mcnab has essentially written tom clancy genre fiction the book bravo two zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol chris ryan called the one that got away however both are convincingly debunked by a third sas memeber in a book called the real bravo two zero also available on amazon though only the uk amazon site which you can still order from in the us in it an sas member who can actually speak arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people mcnab and ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story most importantly he manages to restore without a doubt the reputation of vince phillips blamed by ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the iraqis and a couple members eventually killed contrary to what you may expect i would recommend seeing this in fact i recommend getting and comparing all three books b the one that got away and the real b 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
avoid this movie this has got to be the worst film version of an austin story i ve ever seen the plot is only tenuously connected with the book as for the characters hairstyles costumes it should be subtitled fellini does austin because it most closely resembles the satyricon imo the makeup costuming hair on all the characters is not only not even close to reasonably accurate historically but downright grotesque bizarre and that s just the lead character catherine the rest are worse bad acting too very lame film the austin estate should sue bbc for turning out such a turkey using her name 
not funny yeah those folks in the s sure were paranoid and gullible ha ha how anyone could possibly think that the subject of nuclear holocaust and the fear thereof could be milked for a few laughs is pathetic but even if this film was entirely based on a fictional threat the vast majority of its fitful stabs at humor require a deeper state of inebriation than i would care to endure 
read the book instead i originally read the novel of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany id just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior 
hard to find dvd this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who doesn t have a problem with heavy british accents if you do try it with captions it was fun funny and a nice pick meup when one needs a lift 
should be forgotten as along time fan of paddy chayefsky i found altered states his first novel terribly disappointing the film was in my view utterly dismal the only reason i would recommend it would be as an example of hack movie making if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell both would be relegated to obscurity 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
where is the disco song i love the nightlife not the original film doesn t have the original disco scene with i like the night life song they completely ruined the movie 
do not believe what you can not see i saw this film on ifc it was a very interesting film with great acting by molly parker i order this film and low and behold they had chopped it to pieces it was hard to understand the characters all the necrophilia scenes were severely cut and this is what the film was all about do not waste your time buying this if you want the whole film wait for a director s cut which will hopefully show the film for what it was meant to b 
eh bland bland and more bland it seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance and fell far short of the mark with the except on the main character s mother nearly every single character was completely unlikeable and a little lea delaria goes a long long way it does replicate the s very well but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
deeply disappointing a midnight clear keith gordon keith gordon will probably be best remembered for playing arnie cunningham in john carpenter s so so film version of stephen king s so so novel christine gordon however hung up the acting togs in the late eighties and went behind the camera and it is here he has truly shined turning out such brilliant movies as waking the dead and television genius on such series as house dexter and homicide life on the street the man has an amazing track record so it s with some confusion that i regard those works where gordon comes off as being somewhat less accomplished a midnight clear is one of them based on a novel by william wharton a midnight clear is the story of a world war ii platoon full of misfits natch who are ordered to scout out a mansion inside enemy territory they encounter the enemy but not an enemy they expect the survivors of a german platoon are in a house down the hill looking to surrender the two groups spend a companionable christmas together before they turn to the task of deciding how to get each other out of the situation they ve found themselves in enemies in wartime becoming friends this is not your typical war film characterization is much more important than action here and as in many other substandard war films of this stripe harts war and tigerland immediately come to mind it almost seems as if the director wanted to still play it as an action film there s not enough real character development here to float the entire movie we get to know our main character well enough and the character upon whom the entire plot will turn later we get a little less on the guy who s here for the purpose of building sympathy on the rest of the platoon very little and on the enemy nothing we know more about the back line lieutenant a minor character at best than we do about the germans not up to the standards set by either gordon or wharton 
to the writer of the review entitled an especially prescient film the many toubled undemocratic areas of africa don t have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the united states is destroyed whether or not he actually had the capability to do so the leader of iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability but thanks for commenting as for the film i know it won a couple oscars and all but i just didn t like it i thought the editing was poor that the scenes were long and often unnecessary although the story was good a modern director would have put it together a lot better 
new answer to the question what the worst movie next to missing in action i this by far the worst movie that i have ever paid to see at a theatre that is not to say that it wouldn t make a good rental where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to cents a person but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie wwe entertainment should stick to what it does best wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle outside of a terminator reference made to robert patrick this is a total waste of minutes of your life 
what is it you need to list which movies are in the collection ! i might buy it if i knew same goes for all the other collections sorry ! cesc 
a new beginning of an end i thought i d be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all i wasn t old enough at the time but i m sure fans were slightly bemused at the re emergence of friday the th tommy now a teenager and a bloody old one at that is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of jason and also the death of his mother tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that jason is back from the dead and it seems he may be right when a series of murders begins but who could it possibly be this time jason is dead isn t he its up to tommy to fight his demons once again and get to the bottom of things before he himself becomes the victim of jason voorhees friday the th part is a perfect example of how sequels in horror can ruin what went before the body count in this is ridiculously high and the gore itself leaves a lot to be desired was it really necessary is too much too much the only ounce of credibility in this film is harry manfredini s reprisal musical score other than that you d be forgiven for skipping this friday the th entry 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
could have been good there was a possibility of a very good movie here with good acting talented kids etc unfortunately as in many kids movies these days the parents are stereotyped as blithering idiots and the kids have to go it on their own the cursing gets out of hand for a family movie and gets worse as the movie continues i didn t finish watching it christopher lloyd is great though and it does have it s funny moments if you had tv guardian to block all the foul language that is ! 
quotturbulence heavy metal quot this is one of the worst films ever made ! and i mean it one of the worst scripts i have ever come across the acting is hammy and the direction is very weak ! there was no reason for this movie to exist ! quotturbulencequot was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels ! no way ! if you like the st mabye try quotturbulence fear of flying quot but stay away of the rd this is one terrible movie ! believe me ! 
like all gossip a lot of talk about nothing a very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level the movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue i ve heard better lines in fast times at richmond high thank you altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing don t believe the great reviews about this film the film might appeal to the year old crowds fantasizing about how cool college life might be with all the cool people and parties if you re not in that category skip this boring film and save both your time and your money 
don t even steal this movie this tripe was horrible the only reason i gave it star is because of the bus wreck that was very gory besides that and when the boy scout zombies attack i fast forwarded thru the entire movie even the nudity was horrible if all other movies on earth are destroyed and tv is abolished you should still not watch this film 
ultimate jordan is a lot better i bought this dvd with great anticipation only to be let down sure the visuals are great but i m more interested in the plays that made the jordan experience special the ultimate jordan is a much better dvd 
what a let down disappointment this film was vanilla sky is quite a disappointment considering the presence of tom cruise cameron diaz kurt russell and penelope cruz among others the acting is pretty good but nothing great the plot is below average while the dialogues lines are way beyond below average ! tom cruise and the rest of this amazing cast are given terrible lines and bad roles a shame really the dialogues oh my the dialogues are beyond words as for the plot school plays and pre school for that matter have better storylines ! it is truly sad it seems as though the writers directorsproducers decided to go artsy fartsy on us following in the dreaded footsteps of other such films as it s all about love and the russian ark so it s a weak plot and a great butwasted cast and setting which when put together fail to take off no masterpiece here 
no fun at all loosely connected to the first hm of this sequel has a single tale of lust and immortality in place of the anthology of the older movie while mining an asteroid one of the miners finds a crystal shard the key to a fountain of immortality the fountain itself is on another planet thousands of light years away unfortunately the miner is played okay voiced by michael ironside and faster than you can say oh no general katana is approaching the key consumes the miner s soul and sends him off on a quest of conquest to find the well first off he must ravage a remote planet whose few human inhabitants contain traces of an element that staves off death while successfully carting away most of the population of this distant planet he misses julie a six foot hottie with a big gun and a bottomless reservoir of rage the two battle across the galaxy first to satisfy her thirst for revenge but then for the sake of immortality itself even having been warned this flick is still a big disappointment the first movie was guilty fun catering and yet lampooning the rock fan in each of us the animation was crude yet in a charming way that today s assembly line animation or cgi will never know imagine a story built on all those way out s album covers and you get the idea with animation reflecting an era that predated japanimation heavy metal grew better with age a time capsule of bad music and laughably bad humor the new movie offers none of that no memorable lines images or characters though patterned largely on taarna the terakien from the first movie hm has none of the spirit or wit of the earlier story and julie emotes less character which is bad when you remember that taarna was mute in short the movie offers less than a fraction of the entertainment value of a single episode of heavy metal the magazine 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is

the biggest waste of brian cox ever the premise lisa reisert rachel mcadams is travelling home on the last flight of the night the red eye to miami where she lives and works as a hotel manager for a prestigeous hotel after attending the funeral for her late grandmother jackson rippner cillian murphy is a mysterious and charming stranger she meets in the airport who as it turns out is not so coincidentally taking the same flight as she is rippners reason for travel is strictly business it so happens an assassination is planned on the secretary of homeland security while he stays at lisa s hotel rippner needs lisa to call the hotel and arrange for the secretary to stay in a different room if she doesn t comply he has a man waiting outside her fathers home to kill him thoughtsthis was one of my few experiences with wes craven s director work who is most known for the horrible genre of teenage slasher films i despise i had dismissed this film in theatres without giving a second thought and when i finally saw it last night i knew next to nothing of what it was about from what i vaguely remembered of the previews and given craven s reputation i was honestly expecting rippner to be a supernatural character such as a vampire in hindsite i think vampire on a plane woulda been a much better foundation for a film to call this film s premise shaky is as kind as it is unfair it s unfair because the core plot points could prove to be an interesting thriller the problem with this film is how it executes those points a hotel manager the secretary of homeland security give me a break ! make it the deputy director of the fbi and the president of the united states and we have a plotline that warrants all of this hullabaloo the concept of this film has potential but how it was staged is just too ridiculous are we really to believe that the secretary of homeland security is that important that such an elaborate scheme to assassinate him would be put in place are we really to believe that the only way this assassination which involves missles did i tell you i won t say anymore can be pulled off is if the manager of the hotel can get the secretary to stay in a different room and who are these nameless caucaisions who want the secretary killed and why the premise isn t only shaky it s totally gutless it sickens me that hollywood is so afraid of offending anyone that neither the antagonist nor their motives can in any way reflect real world people situations or beliefs it forces me to recall the debacle of the last adaptation of the great jack ryan thrillers by tom clancy the sum of all fears in that film instead of having militant muslim terrorists acquire a nuclear warhead lost by isreal which truly is something to fear they decided to go with nazi s heaven forbid we offend all the militant muslim terrorists of the world by portraying them as the evil stain on humankind that they are i digress my point is simply that red eye doesn t even go that far it has no voice it doesn t tell us anything and worse it s too spineless to put a face on fear there are some good things about the film first and foremost is the cast while rachel mcadams is completely not believable as a manager of a prestigious miami hotel that part of her character is more of sidenote and it s a fault of casting more than her acting anyway cillian murphy is very talented and he has a look that allows him to come off as charming one moment and creepy the next i still wish he woulda turned out to be a vampire though finally we have the legendary brian better than anthony hopkins as hannible lector cox he s such a great actor but in this film he s relegated to the most menial of roles almost every scene he s in is him answering the phone being woken up by the phone or picking up the morning paper the film is ok in it s first two acts with the second act being the strongest part of the film where rachel and cillian have performances confined mostly to their seats on the plane it s here that the tension builds and the performances really hold the scenes then comes the third act were the film just breaks down in to complete ludicrousness the story continues off the plane and gives up completely on being an intellectual thriller instead it goes for the action route and follows just about every cliche for a movie of this type the verdict red eye has an interesting idea that could have beened turned into something a lot better under a more able screenwriter and director the actors performances do the best they can to keep this ship afloat if you can ignore the ridiculous parts of this film which are about as far fetched as your typical network tv thrillers then you may find some enjoyment your first time through it s not horrible but neither is it really good 
inferior sequel i loved mortal kombat and i thought the sequel would carry on the great kombat legacy i was heartily dissapointed when i saw annihilation brian johnson was cool as khan but some of the special effects were so fake i had to laugh robin shou returns as liu kang the savior of earth after killing shang tsung the group heads on home when all of a sudden the emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down therekhan makes his first appearance along with his abnormal yet awesome soldiers johnny cage is killed and rayden now played by james remar fights khan winning but sacrificing johnny cage nowearth has seven days before it s destroyed what i didn t like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film like scorpion and sub zerowho heard of sub zero having a brother another thing that got me was how liu kang s fighting got worse since the first film he was losing every battle except the end and even then he wasl osing do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
what what what i have to wonder what world what physical plane what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on or maybe they are full moon employees lol first of all the movie especially one of the earlier scenes was identical to the s flick the unnamable which is also and hp lovecraft based flick the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit when he breaks out his cell well this was just hilarious it reminded me of the incredible hulk yes jeffrey combs is in it but his acting is cheesy as it can be hunt down the unnamable instead a much better movie 
forgettable western this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it isn t what a shame it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense buy or rent on your own if you dare i wouldn t

i can t buy into it amanda pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity but otherwise this film did nothing for me a bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests i can t even relate and they re trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness yeah right ! see it if you re a big fan of fart jokes or whatever 
should not have had the same title as original when i heard that timecop had a sequl coming out i couldnt wait to see it then i found out it wasnt john claude vanne damme why bother making a sequl with no returning cast members especially the star vanne damme is replaced by jason scott lee jungle book as the hero who travels through time to prposly change things around here and there i saw reveiwa that this was a movie for sci fi geeks to enjoy i didnt see much on the sci fi side apart from time travel but it makes me wonder why they didnt just name it something else and make a seperate movie instead of calling it a second installment to a great movie 
enjoyable at some parts but just plain stupid in others what i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its monty python ! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind if you are new to monty python i would get the quest for the holy grail before this one also the monty python s flying circus is great too it comes in a dvd set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff i really did not enjoy certain parts but there is a few good moments 
jason takes manhattan they should ve just called it friday the th titanic this has got to be the most s est movie ever it completeley ruined the friday the th series jason did not have hair and was deformed as a childhe was on a boat for most of the movie and appeared in new york at the end why the hell did jason turn back into a boy at the end when he melted in the toxic wastejason s face is just f ing stupid at the end i mean seriously he looks like zippy from f ing rainbow why did they even make it 
what a pity i hope people don t start to think of this movie as alien in my mind this is a whole new venture one that is separate from any of the work that sigourney weaver did on the first four alien films the first films are pretty good and i really like the whole series it works rather well and i would love to see another alien film with sigourney in it i think they could pull off one more film ripley s a great hero this movie was pretty bad the only reason i give it stars is because of the special effects i felt like i was watching a scooby doo version of alien whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money the plot was wellstupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non existent each of the first four alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of sigourney s involvement this one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair 
aims low and hits its target this straight tovideos modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison this prison only seems to house about inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it s resolved in much too pat a fashion however leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around and there s a torture scene modeled on the one in lethal weapon in which he s hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks mr thomas performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell 
beware for any of you teachers out there who plan to watch this in your classroom with your students beware first of all i ve heard of taking liberties with a book but this is ridiculous ! sex between farmer jones and the neighbor farmer s wife is not in the book but sure is shown in the movie i was shocked to see them rolling under the sheet as the headboard was knocking against the wall utterly revolting and embarassing for me and my students i expect better from hallmark entertainment family home entertainment etc second there is a no rating statement on the dvd i m angry about this and don t appreciate being taken advantage of there was no warning about adult situations it s a shame that one can t be truthful in advertising buyer beware

a convoluted mess did not like this movie except for the acting which was it s only redeeming quality this movie jumps all over the place and after a while i just gave up trying to follow it although i did watch it to the end hoping it would end up making sense boy was i wrong was never so happy to see end credits roll i do not recommend this movie unless you are one of those people who can keep track of ten things at once if you are youll love it otherwise don t waste your time 
very boring the plot to this movie or so called sequal is horrible i rented this movie expecting something good and i end up falling asleep i actually had to watch it several times just to find out what really happened don t even buy it it is a waist of your money 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
out of the pick up artist is a dangerously bad film there is absolutely no chemistry between robert downey and molly ringwald molly ringwald may have been of the most iconic s female actresses and she certainly proves her worth here ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character wasn t supposed to be that marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element the real joke in this film has to be robert downey his acting is insanely moronic i often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick i am pretty sure robert downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to from the start to the end i was annoyed i couldn t see how dennis hopper and danny aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it harvey keitel gives a fair performance but i believe he is much tougher than that comparing harvey keitel s performance in bad lieutenant reservoir dogs and mean streets to the pick up artist it is enough to make an apparent observation that harvey keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this a smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was rising sun and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film why did they have to call it the pick up artist could they give the movie a better title such as the player

so many gaps in the story this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he s suffered in cuba and that s about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what s going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it s trying to convey it s lost in the plotless story 
poor reproduction of great movies this is an extremely disappointing copy of great original movies looks as if it was duplicated on poor dvd equipment from old used vhs tapes no wonder it s hard to find out who made this i wouldn t want to take credit for it either hard to enjoy in this poor format my delivery took place in february 
great film horrible dvd the video is geometrically distorted interlaced has blown out contrast almost no detail at all and horrible sound transflux films should be ashamed for putting out such poor quality work yet including a featurette on the cover designer everyone should avoid this dvd and go for the bfi double feature with l age d or which has a watchable un chein andalou for a change 
the postman is a very seriously boring movie the postman is a very seriously boring movie with terrible story line one of the most conspicuous flops of its decade and there is good reason for it i had to write this review when i saw that there were several people actually rating this movie at stars seriously guys you forgot to take your pills this morning and your friends will the white coats will be visiting later to check on you until then please refrain from using your pc as we are in danger of obliteration of good taste 
a very long political attack ad i was trying to think of the best short description of what this is sure it s a propaganda film but that doesn t mean much to most people however most people have seen attack ads around election time that s what this is a very long political attack ad full of all the things we commonly see in such ads distortions sarcasm scary close ups mood music mocking tone glaring omissions out of context quotes etc that said the most rewarding review so far must be the one by at dl new york who basically condemns michael moore as pro bush because fahrenheit doesn t say bush engineered himself what s next a review that condemns at dl new york as pro bush because his review didn t say that bush flew the planes himself or that bush is an alien who gave birth to saddam and osama on a ufo just when you think you ve seen the craziest conspiracy theory 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
one word dull i read this book for a project two years ago i wasn t about to finish this book and had to move to another one first off this book lacks emotion this character is so boring she doesn t seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me a book without emotion is just unreadable i hated this book but i don t like most scott o dell books just go read another book 
the book was great and the movie wasn t period do yourself a favor and read the book and dont even look at this movie 
large disappointment showgirl is mistakenly taken to paris to perform for diplomatic relations accompanied by bolger wanna guess the ending everything from the songs to the plot are unconvincing and so very predictable not to be seen twice 
can i get a quotwhat the quot let me explain the situation we have here young orphan kids who roller blade around trying to bring down a corporation with the help of a glowing ball sound familiar probably not i would say that nothing in the galaxy compares to the sheer stupidity of such a concept recomendation i have none i have decided that slamming one s head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
an arid technical exercise and not nearly as funny as it thinks it is despite liking a couple of his movies i ve never been a fan of preston sturges and a second viewing of unfaithfully yours did nothing to change that with rare exceptions like frasier or comme une image most supposedly sophisticated comedies are usually either too clever by half or not half as clever as they think they are this definitely falls into the latter category it may be slightly more articulate but it still comes down to pratfalls and clichs clumsily dispensed not to mention an incredibly one dimensional role for linda darnell as the wife whose sole reason for existence seems to be to worship her husband unfortunately it soon becomes apparent that despite his confidence in the early part of the film rex harrison is entirely wrong for the part aside from being so incredibly unsympathetic that he simply alienates you for most of the film he has absolutely no facility for physical comedy which renders what could and should have been a great comic setpiece where he accidentally trashes his hotel room far more thoroughly than any rock star ever could even dream of rather tedious and protracted alfred newman s surprisingly crudely over the top slide whistle and horn comic underscoring all but stones the scene to death a surprising lapse of judgment from a great composer in a film revolving around classical music in the hands of an actor with a modicum of physical comedy timing it could have been gold but instead it s almost reduced to a technical exercise but the same could be said for much of the film the idea of having the execution and resolution of harrison s fantasies dictated by the pace of the music he conducts rossini for murder wagner for mournful forgiveness tchaikovsky for suicide is inspired but it results in scenes that feel forced as if at the mercy of a galley slave master s drumbeat that the scenes themselves are so predictable doesn t help as goodwill and admiration gradually gives way to boredom in the second half there are however two saving graces one is the scene in private detective edgar kennedy s office where harrison is furious to discover that the man he has come to castigate is a knowledgeable fan with his own tale of loss the scene is crudely performed and reads better than it plays but there s heart and humanity there that s lacking in too much of the rest of the film but the film s genuine standout moment is the orchestra rehearsal one of the best pieces of filmed musical performance in the movies not only showing how the music is constructed but showing the life character and human soul behind it the loss of those qualities in the rest of the movie is all the more keenly felt in an increasingly arid and overplayed technical exercise 
for mamet fans only i couldn t get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking the characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do mamet appears to have never left manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective to be honest i didn t finish the entire film but instead checked the tv guide for reruns of northern exposure for the real thing 
creaky charles laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised but it s lumbering and creaky with heavy handed theatrics typical of the early talky era i found watching this picture very heavy going 
land of oprahisms having avoided seeing this film i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on brought tuesdayunbiden into our home my aversion to oprah and her ilk does not cloud my dislike of this film a bad film is a bad film devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned and directionless directing this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward something should occur my interest should be engaged this film takes reams of pre packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses and attempts to build the plot from words alone it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said heythis book is full of words lets make a movie in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting to be honest jack lemmon was not very good in this film he played the same character he always did just older hank azaria was just awful he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones and was wooden and expressionless maybe he was too embarrased to be there as to the other actor s well they filled up the space nicely the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was they even covered the green leaves on the trees some better acting some good r rated dialogue and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film as it stands however it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr phil etc the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases a good cry and a genial talk show presenter will somehow make it all better ifor one think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial then pull the finger out and just get on with it to the grammar and form police i did have this in paragraphs but the editing process scrunched it all together sorry 
shockingly revisionist and doctrinaire view of jazz history throughly dismisses all jazz after including fusion free jazz and everything thereafter marsalis actually calls cecil taylor s music selfindulgent bullsh apparently taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film how was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual but more likely agenda driven on pbs i will never understand if you think swing is the only valid form of jazz you will love this series if you think coltrane is a god you get five minutes summary so lets see here hours on louis armstrong and duke minutes on coletrane and a total didmissal of everything after duke s death reminds me of the republisuck s fair and balanced nonsense pbs this is your wake up call stop trying to rewrite history jazz ain t in a museum just ask the artists most of whom are alive whom burns left out metheny you out there 
one step above truly hideous i am a jane austen fan i love pride and prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel however mansfield park is jane austen s most complex and serious novel and on the whole it is my favorite fanny price is the most difficult of the jane austen heroines not the wittiest or most beautiful but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong she is mentored by her uncle the righteous and honorable and i don t use the terms loosely sir thomas bertram somehow the adaptation of this great novel has twisted sir thomas into a sadistic sexual pervert moreover fanny is constantly babbling to us in jane austen quips that are not part of this novel they simply missed the point of the book the acting is okay the settings are okay the directing is sad but the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste 
political propoganda remember when mary poppin s said a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down this movie is saying a spoonful of cute dancing penguins helps the policital propoganda go down this is not a kids movie it is a cartoon aimed at drawing a wide audience especially kids in order to force feed them the directors views on morality homosexuality and environmentalism the political undertones and overtones in this movie are so blatant and obvious it is ridiculous if you want hollywood to be your moral compass then this movie is perfect for you otherwise stay away 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download 
not a good choice for me my child is years old she watched about minutes into the movie and appeared to be quite frightened by some of the images the story line appeared to be sensible but not one that a toddler will understand at the end of the day i do not think the point of the story is what she remembers as much as she will remember the scarry pirate 
pretty lame maybe i m spoiled by big budget sci fi films but i thought this movie kind of stunk it felt and looked like a tv movie and wasn t scary at all the best funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady s name or face and everyone described her the same way the one with the glasses oh her havent seen her lol 
bad acting hot stars i must admit that i am a guy and that i bought this movie before seeing it i was not shocked with the horrible acting but was surprised with the hot stars this movie had both hot guys and girls the actor that caught my eye was steven albrecht freddy he is so hot we get see him completely nude showing off his hot body he did a great job in his breif scene josh edwards trian was okay to look at too as for the actress venesa taylor is also hot 
stars it s hard to give this movie any credit after watching anthropophagus the grim reaper i came away with mixed feelings on the one hand anthropohagus had its moments albeit quite few where it was somewhat chilling the anthropohagus himself was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between unfortunately the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie and for some reason it is just very difficult to get over this fact in anthropophagus probably because these weaknesses are so glaring anthropophagus may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes so the gore hound shouldn t be disappointed with this flick however with that being said anthropophagus simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love ultimately what you have in anthropophagus is horrible acting a poorly written screenplay uneven and poorly developed plot and action below average plot execution just a couple of scary moments some laughable scenes a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting deplorable and depraved scene of violence fetus scene that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that i ve ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror if that kind of thing appeals to you this could be right up your alley but it doesn t do much for me i would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension suspense and a scary story and you simply do not get that in anthropophagus to answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie did anthropophagus bother me no did i think it was scary certainly not laughable at some points in the movie but not scary and nor did i find it disturbing however it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low budget italian made horror flick touche in my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack what did i find in anthropophagus but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline indeed it is very difficult to give this movie any credit a word of advice if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings like i did with this one it probably just sucks for all intents and purposes that is the case with anthropophagusthe grim reaper nevertheless sadly i ve seen much much worse 
inferior sequel i loved mortal kombat and i thought the sequel would carry on the great kombat legacy i was heartily dissapointed when i saw annihilation brian johnson was cool as khan but some of the special effects were so fake i had to laugh robin shou returns as liu kang the savior of earth after killing shang tsung the group heads on home when all of a sudden the emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down therekhan makes his first appearance along with his abnormal yet awesome soldiers johnny cage is killed and rayden now played by james remar fights khan winning but sacrificing johnny cage nowearth has seven days before it s destroyed what i didn t like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film like scorpion and sub zerowho heard of sub zero having a brother another thing that got me was how liu kang s fighting got worse since the first film he was losing every battle except the end and even then he wasl osing do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
a must view for sophia loren fans even though i am not a sophia loren fan i thoroughly enjoyed her perfomance in these different short stories about totally different women anyone born before should enjoy them as well 
pointless a film about filmmaking of no interest almost hours long a film about filmmaking a narcissistic view of the movie business the film is about a film being shot and ends when this is accomplished we see what goes on in the daily lives of those involved in the work from the director the same truffaut to the producer to the cast to the stuntman there s a curious lady a wife to one of the employees who sits knitting and watching her husband so he doesn t cheat on her during work everybody keeps busy working and flirting chaotically and the only one who does not mix work and pleasure seems to be the director and maybe the producer it s supposed to be funny and even nostalgic there are visual references to the great classic directors in film history to how the film industry has changed one thing to learn from this story is that fiction plays a role in our lives it serves as a contrast to the frivolity and emptiness of our real lives do you think the story of a woman who falls for her father inlaw can still be interesting today asks a reporter to the leading star that question is quite revealing of what our world has become sex and alcohol keep these pitiful troupe working like gasoline keeps a car running another important moment is when the knitting lady mentioned before gets tired of watching so much promiscuity going around and starts yelling at the whole crew what role does she play is she the typical conservative fun spoiler or is she truffaut s alter ego hard to say and that s one reason why this whole film is pointless it just describes what goes on which is not interesting at all there s no plot there are no interesting characters only adults acting as children acting as adults in another scene the director s assistant another sexy gal after one of the female workers runs away with the stuntman and leaves her lover says i could leave a man for a film but never a film for a man which doesn t make her any more likeable to me at least if it had been only or minutes of film i would have given it stars a film as empty and pointless as its characters 
not in the holmes tradition for sherlock holmes fans following basil and jeremy this flick fails ! attempts to comic and spoof roles played by rathbone and brett doesn t work this is a film that once seen probably not in line for a second viewing not worthy of a wilder performance 
too true to life i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch that is how good it is 
pan scan marginalizes the presentation unfortunately the image is cropped to full screen ironically the trailer included on the disc is in x 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
i made it all the way through alright second time i did but i still enjoyed it i went into this just hoping bolo would be in a few one onone fights and luckily he was he looks pretty tough and is not a bad kung fu actor but his directing job just fails miserably btu with a ton of great character actors and all teh final fight baddies are funny so it wasn t a total loss of a movie not like some of bolo s newer day stuff overall a comedy that works but only in that aspect the kung fu could have been really good but then againagain i have seen much much worse the final fight was fun and was a good way to end the movie pai pao is pretty good but thsi movie i think would be really popular around the ladies cause i got pretty sick at looking at bolo and his fake beard just ruined his character also there is a part where bolo gets mad and then smoke comes out of his nose enjoyalso the movie would have recieved a but some of the kung fu was actually really good and a widescreened presentation would have helped tremendously but then again maybe i didn t see it very well cause bolo and pai paio were the action directors so full screened and a watchable picture no distortion or fuzzy lines would have been watchable i guess if the movie was better 
pathetic excuse for comedy stars this movie was even more ignorant in a bad way compared to that other movie the stupids and i thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well the name of the movie dumberer explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is the old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh don t waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it s worth every penny for comedy fans 
the village idiots note if you don t want to know how the movie ends don t read this im giving you fair warning now so don t complain about spoilers later the only reason i m mentioning the ending and the big secret is because i d like to spare you from the huge disappointment i experienced when watching this movie when i first walked into the theatre to see this i couldn t have been more excited after months of waiting i d finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time i saw it ! the movie started out wonderfully great acting scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds and at times almost unbearable suspense that shyamalan really knows how to scare ! the story takes place in a small town in the s at first this town seems like the perfect place to live the people are friendly the houses are cozy and the scenery is beautiful despite the peaceful setting however we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from being completely at ease every now and then they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village nobody ever ventures into it and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it pretty soon we find out why according to the village elders there are dangerous hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain these creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village it attracts them for years the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding as long as the villagers stay out of the forest the monsters will not harm them at one point however one of the creatures enters the village at night leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack while all this is happening we the audience still don t know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are it was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end there are no monsters in the woods when one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words its all a farce i still couldn t believe what i was hearing it was all i could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre ! after months of anticipating this film of expecting a truly scary thriller and of trying to guess what the monsters really are there are no monsters ! disappointed doesn t even begin to describe it it got worse though the next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the monsters the villagers aren t really living in the s they re living in a modern day wildlife reserve supposedly the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people but when tragedy struck their families they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new if extremely delusional life the story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth they even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real ! when the retarded boy died in the woods still wearing the stupid costume the leaders rather than mourning him remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures i basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them what parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that i don t think i ve ever been this disappointed in a movie before not only was it completely misleading but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic im sorry but i have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it many fans of this movie have said that those of us who didn t like it dont get it i assure you i did get it and i didn t like it anyway i m no fan of slasher films and i didn t expect this to be one but i also don t appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters the two stars are for the cast and the filming better luck next time guys 
valentine director jamie blankscast denise richards david broeanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw jessica cauffiel katherine heigl hedy burress fulvio cecere running time minutesrated r for strong horror violence some sexuality and language valentine the over slasherized version of the excellent tom savage suspense novel starts with a pre teen valentine disco set in a bespectacled young boy heads on the dance floor looking for a young female to share a dance with first he approaches shelly later played by katherine heigl who embarrassingly rebuffs him his charm doesn t seem to work with lilly jessica cauffer paige denise richards or kate marley shelton either they all send him packing quite arrogantly his luck changes when dorothy jessica capshaw actually acknowledges him and the twosome leave hand in hand they are later caught kissing under a bench by a gang of bullies in order to save her own self from persecution dorothy accuses the youngsters of attacking her and so the gang decides to take their own revenge they cover him in red gooey stuff carrie anyone strip him and chase him onto the dance floor where they proceed to beat him up fast forward ten years and the girls are now women no one is sure what happened to jeremy the bullied brat from earlier as he disappeared after that dance it s close to valentine s day of course and they each receive a card signed with a poetic threat to their lives they soon realize to take them seriously when shelly is found with her throat sliced before long a mysterious masked madman stalks each of them leaving kate and her boyfriend adam david boreanaz to work out that she s next on the psycho s list the acting is standard horror fare denise richards once again shows us her amazing and wide range acting talents those two large things attached to the front side of her body that we like to call breasts david boreanaz gives a fair performance but definitely shouldn t give up his day job on the wb s angel newcomer marley shelton can t do much with her underwritten role and she comes off as extremely annoying and whiny for the most part the rest of the acting is close to pitiful another problem with valentine is that the characters are all so self indulgent and morally extracted that it s almost impossibility for them to win over the audience in the beginning they re shown as mockers to any child that s unfortunate enough to be less pretty than their egotistical selves and actually possess a brain this discrimination continues throughout the movie as they brush off the men who are trying to woo them out on a date simply because they re not up to their high standards how can anyone want such pompously arrogant characters to survive in a typical slasher movie the final girl is usually the shy reclusive type that the audience feels sympathetic towards like laurie strode these characters have no such power leading you to believe that the world would be a better place without them anyway director jamie banks urban legend has proved that he has the potential to become a fair filmmaker however this is his first feature failure it s a shame that he couldn t have made more of the talented cast and competent budget but in the end valentine just feels empty a couple of talented cast members are not really enough to warrant the many obnoxious ones cupid certainly missed when he fired the arrow of fortune at this heart this one s destined to escape our memories in the not toodistant future 
there must be a conspiracy something fishy is certainly going on if the average review for this movie is stars this is truely the worst adaptation of a novel ever made costner should be tried for crimes against cinematography this movie is far beyond awful 
truly the worst garbo film ever pauvre greta she is radiant in this disaster of a film primarily because her love interest is ramon navarro a gay spanish actor playing a straight russian prince it is very sad laughable casting like a gay ricky ricardo pretending he is a i can t think of a russian straight counterpart to clark gable garbo tries hard barrymore tries harder adrian tries the hardest to no avail avoid this film at all cost an interesting plot line filmed with calamitous results 
michael moore propaganda stooge of the uaw michael moore filmed this propaganda partially financed by the united auto workers to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants the japanese auto invasion made possible by gm s unhealthy cost structure the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal so roger smith becomesthe reason for the plant closings years of losses at gm have shown moore s twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then phoney uaw sponsored lies to shift attention away from theprimary role played by the uaw in the death spiral of the automakers moore and others pretend gm management had dropped the ball but gm lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain all of gm s problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the uaw albatross slow redesign cycles lack of money for research you name it moore will never mention how the uaw has screwed the consumers for the past years andhow now that consumers have a choice they find the better value in asian autos nobody wants to pay a uaw worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor the uaw has fixed labor prices for long enough enough is enough and mooreis shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a documentary 
what happened at the last mins i agree with most of the reviews here that the movie is just so bad the director had the wrong idea of an art film methophors and strange incoherrent ending is not the only thing you need to make an art film i was pretty intrigued by the lead s obssession with the hunky swimmer but it just did not end the movie satisfactorily can anyone explain like when did he have the rubber suite whats with the garbage dump ending it is just too pointless i felt cheated of mins of my life 
defense of jamie gertz i m writing because i thought fine s review was bad i was interested in this movie because it has jamie gertz who has proven to be a durable dependable character actress mr fine may or may not have talent but he is not spectacular waspishness insults are passe and not becoming to a serious reviewer ms gertz by contrast turns an abundance of personality to good account through her career i just don t know what untalented means in the context of this silly movie but it was twenty years ago is the insult intended to be forthe movie or for her whole career since kbad form and fuzzy thinking i think the movie is an attempt to imitate features of flashdance upbeat background music meaningless but interesting visuals skill display romance people with aspirations surviving at a humble level jamie gertz is the face girl 
no need to suicide i get the story line but grown women need to suicide the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself it is not matching the character 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
vulgar and disgusting saw this one on television vincent van gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy the artist who portrays him does his job very well the scenery is breathtaking however the nudity in the film is vulgar the chaeracters are hard to identify with some of the scenes are disgusting not going to see this one again 
messed with the original vhs release made it worse loren michels ruins most things he touches they left out the hot tub sketch where eddie play s as the late great james brown it may be one of the most funny sketches in the history of television i could see that thing times and i would still laugh as hard as the first time seeing it ! i stand buy the greatness of that sketch snl was riding the eddie murphy thing all the way to the bank the show would most likley been canceled in my opinion the show was unwatchable without him an piscapo teamed up then to make this thing worse is that the vhs version had zero gumby sketches in it still great without it thought i see they have a gumby sketch in the dvd version i think oh cool a gumby dammit segment but it ends up being one of the lamest one s around what they didn t want to pay piscapo the royalties for showing the one where gumby goes on letterman piscapo as letterman do everyone a favor and don t purchase this watered down version delirious just came out get that instead that is garunteed to make u laugh ! this dvd meeeeh 
a putrid stinker of a film this has to be one of the worst movies i ve ever wasted my time watching ! don t dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic drew barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant random nudity the storyline could have worked yet the movie is pathetically low budget the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat it is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with drew barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point it s so bad that i had to come here to vent about it online the director was obviously a film school drop out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn 
stars it s like watching a recruitment video for the kkk filled with errors i counted factual errors aka lies during michael moore s opening speech i stopped shortly after im not going to waste my time on such obviously factually wrong fiction how stupid does mr moore think we are i was there watching the election unfold and what he reported is not what happened example he said fox news pressured nbc cbs abc and cnn to change their minds and give florida to gore and then bush what a load of lies fox news has no power over the other nets nbc cbs abc cnn operate independently and reached their decisions independently without influence from fox and furthermore the other nets did not call for bush as moore falsely claimed they labeled florida undecided and left it that way for several days also moore claimed that a recount showed gore won florida false a bipartisan committee counted the votes a few months later and not only did bush win but the recount increased his lead from a few hundred to several thousand because of conservative communities in western florida many other non biased groups found the same result this video reminds me of his columbine documentary where men s ties kept changing colors in the middle of their speeches its called creative editing moore has no ethics propagandist as far as i m concerned he s no better than a kkk member same mental disorder illogic 
snowboarding mixed with bullets and action dont mix this movie started out good but then got all mushy with the action and the gunfire good snowboarding stunts and the cast is great sawa looks a little scruffy looking like i said with the snowboarding and action dont mix well and it gets muddled when the badguys come alon 
dumb performances everything is this movie seems out of place the old cliche quotgood cop bad cop quot lived by sutherland and his pal doesn t work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance totally unconvincing unreal flat anyway it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time 
not widescreen i didn t even open this copy of gothic as soon as i realized it wasn t letterboxed i immediately returned it i ve seen the movie before i love ken russell but i wont watch it if isn t in letterbox 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
garbage pure and simple this has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made you have been warned 
teri hatcher naked big deal where s the curves she s built like a yearold boy give me vida guerra anyday 
disgusting and pointless listen bunuel what are we going to do the witch has quit says too much nudity who does she think she is mother theresa i am a little busy jp quiet babe ! can t you see i am talking to my producer here just get another broad for the role anybody only with a good front but maestro ! we d have to re shoot half of the movie fernando is already talking of another engagement in any event with his rate if we use him again it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick we might as well scrap the whole thing dont worry jp we ll keep shooting as if nothing happened that s what being great director all about they are morons or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage most won t even notice that the face is different and those who do will find a good explanation for it subliminal surreal existential women are alike all that nonsense you know relax and have a drink 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
manipulative trash i m disgusted by depalma this is trash and so is he it is too manipulative and it is completely his fault he stretches out these horror scenes in the most manipulative way as we watch travolta fight his way through crowds to save the girl this kind of manure self censorship angers me this isn t art it s garbage his whole purpose is to manipulate us to extend the horror scene in the most manipulative way don t you see how phony it is don t you resent how he is playing with your emotions you call this art you call this talent you call this good directing it s trash he stinks if he s trying to copy hitchcock he s not doing it right why not show us travolta swimming through sharks trying to save the girl i got it how about travolta pushing kindergarten kids out of the way trying to save the girl from a four year old strangler and stretch the scene out make it last through the whole milk and cookies period as travolta keeps pushing kids out of his way and the kids are merrily eating their oreos and the girl is getting strangled eeek that s a good scream depalma you stink what other stupid tricks can you do 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
so so i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it s cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in it ain t that much better on a whole 
redneck extravanganza on a budget this a dreadful example of what jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat husbandsloversthe only reason to watch it would be because mamie van doren was also in it but be aware and i read that in a biography about jayne that in their contracts was specified that they would not appear together in any scene whatsoever so you see them separately in different scenes also be aware that if you blink you will not see either of the blonde beauties conclusionget this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ol south or someone with a white hood showing his eyes onl 
could not be viewed i downloaded it and i couldn t view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money 
boring i only liked it when pinnochio talked that was funny but the rest of the movie was discusting some of the scens were very sick not the blood but other things there was no blood hardly and i could have made it alot better i espected a good film but it was and i would never see it again 
sofia milos is all the money the order sheds light on a religious sect dating back to the crusades having survived throughout the centuries it aims at fulfilling a prophecy which would plunge mankind into a third world war in short the acting and the dialogues are extremely weak van damme and charlton heston really disappoint with their performances ! while the plot and the setting are actually very good therefore the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers could act and write as for the rating if you re going to have it rated r at least give it the sex and or the violence if not give it the proper rating i e pg overall far from being a masterpiece it just might provide for an evening s entertainment if in a really silly mood and or intoxicated starsif van damme movies is what you had in mind check out the legionnaire and timecop 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
you have to download amazon software into your pc i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company s software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon s player to view it blah you re better off buying the dvd for with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
barberella psychadela it s not the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those aren t basinger s legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd s characters and keeping in form he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film but that s no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however his contribution seems way overstated to me he doesn t have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step mother is not like other people basinger s character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think jar jar blinks i suppose it s ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that s it flat and mechanical 
dead and bloated my second review as my first did not get printed as usual anyway i ll try to make this short and sweet i usually try and give credits to directors producers writers and actors in most of my movie reviews however i m going to make an exception here i ve read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd hilarious night of the living dead money color wonderful for gorehounds etc etc etc all i can say is it must not take much to please you people this is without a doubt the worst excuse for a movie i ve ever seen my most humble apologies to tobe hooper and mortuary the whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning why don t critics take horror movies more seriously well einstein here s a glowing example this is nothing but grade d trash horrible effects horrible acting horrible writing horrible directing you name it it s not in there this movie s most feeble attempts at humor come off as just that feeble i bought this together with dead and breakfast and i can t begin to tell you which one is worse so here s a little advice from me go check out a book at the library buy a book go to a real movie have your hair done have a manicure do anything but waste your time on this gag fest for all the wrong reasons of a movie another one that i would give zero stars to if i could 
silly disappointing kid movie colorado s san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is myfavorite place to vacation in the usa so when i saw the preview ofdurango kids on another dvd i decided to rent it on netflix it isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish and the kids whilecute outsmart all the stupid adults the first minutes showed somenice locations in and around durango including the steam train thatswhy i purchased a used copy but then it goes into time travel to saveouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore intended for young and undemanding children don t bother unless youlove durango as much as i do 
great performances are not enough to save it i rented this movie because i really adore the two lead actors however although they do the best they can there is no saving this banal movie of the week esque movie there are a couple of nice moments most notably when d onofrios character talks about his father and about his love of football other than that the story seems to be cobbled together from many other uplifting movies at times you can not only guess what will happen next but can guess what the exact line will be football hero becomes self pitying after an accident leaves him blind and unable to satisfy his cheap girlfriend in the sack which she exposes in a tell all book his tutor from school shows up himself in a wheelchair and pops this crazy idea to enter a whitewater rafting race even though he professes to have it all together and is all rah rah he still feels his own sadness that his dreams of being a dentist were dashed by a drunk driver but first you knew it they have to learn to trust each other this involves whacky stunts the two drive to the race having adventures learning about themselves and each other suprising locals with can do spirit each scene seems to end with the two sharing a warm laugh in the fuzzy sunset each person they run into is nutty and even though i said i liked this the lines from the scene where olee talks about his dad seem to practically be directly from the breakfast club where the jock talks emotionally about his dad only the commitment of hines and d onofrio keep this one from getting no stars at all so to recap person who s cocky and beloved for his physical prowess loses it and feels sorry for himself check that person has one last chance to hear the chanting of the crowd and relive the glory check another person who s been down that same road of self pity and redemption comes along to save him check two men bond on the road and endure colorful locals yup student becomes teacher yes locals try to keep them down check other dreamers lend a hand drunk driving boy stunted emotionally by father bathroom humor improbable competition set up to prove worth of the outsiders and won to stirring music and cheers all those who ve been touched by the quest and who we ve met along the way show up at the end suprise ending that is supposed to warm your heart and teach you what s really important yes yes yes 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
youre going down burnhead i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i cannot compare the character to other sources therefore coming from someone that did not know darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment there are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies like the shadow batman etc which is interesting nevertheless darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make up of the cast liam neeson larry drake and frances mcdormand among others it is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement in an effort to exact revenge he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets victimsin short the acting and the plot are average nothing great while the dialogues are way below average the movie falls into the action adventurehorror type of category the characters are overall bland and just plain uninteresting eg rick anderson played by the fool ted raimi from the xena series though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really in a nutshell it s not a movie you would want to add to your collection but it might provide for an evening s entertainment and that s about it no masterpiece here stars 
disappointed so not at all what i was expecting i had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it i was terribly disappointed and confused 
not a good movie as the reviewers here say it is i just saw this movie on in hd some people said that this movie is a hidden gem at first i felt the same way i didn t even know such a movie existed then after about minutes the movie became really boring it just drags on with a weak synopsis the cast includes some famous actors and actresses and i think they are pretty good actors but without an interesting storyline the movie is a boring piece of work that leaves no impressions 
why has this been cut a totally awesome movie when it was first released hawaii is based on the james a michener bestseller even at three hours plus it still had to leave a lot of michener s novel untouched but the basic idea is still there the breathtaking cinematography adds to it as does an outstanding elmer bernstein score then there s the acting by the stars max von sydow as the missionary who goes to hawaii to preach to the natives and brings his own brand of religion with him julie anderws is outstanding in a rare non singing role as his wife richard harris is excellent as the sea captain who is amazed that the preacher s wife turns out to be an old girlfriend the supporting characters are just as memoriable with an actual islander playing the queen and also an unknown playing keoki all in all take hawaii complete or don t take it at all wait until the complete version comes out on dvd i rated it one star because of the cuts but it is a five star movie in its complete version 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
ooooh rotoscope big deal who cares that part alone was not a redeeming factor for the film i m not going to even get into the fact that the actors performances were dull to say the least or that the plot from beginning to end was lackluster i actually wasted renting this schlock on on demand boy do i want my bucks back basically all this movie was about was five crackheads running around playing crackhead games if i wanted to see that i could have saved my money and walked around the corner furthermore i could have got a camcorder and made a movie about a bunch of fiends sitting around the house babbling about nonsense for two hours would have saved millions to sum up i would like to advise folks to please avoid this as if it was the ebola virus ! 
maybe i m blind but i just don t see it i just want to say that i really really wanted to like this movie i just couldn t bring myself to it came on ifc the other night and since i ve been on this independent film kick lately that and it starred penn morton and thurman i decided to give it a watch through i had heard good things about it mostly about morton s performance as well as penn so i can honestly say i had high expectations those expectations sadly were not met first of all i want to say that penn s performance was so overrated i was left appalled that he was even considered among spacey crowe and washington that year morton on the other hand did add some weight to the picture and proved that she is a commanding actress even when she says not a single word penn plays fictional jazz guitarist emmett ray a very conceded and irresponcible man who spent his time womanizing and obsessing over better known musician djamgo reinhardt the film follows this mans life as he takes up with hattie morton a mute woman who s nave enough to love this man and then leaves her to marry aspiring news reporter blanche thurman who is using emmett for a story the much underused anthony lapaglia and brad garrett make almost too short cameos as gangsters who get involved with emmett and blanche all in all this was a very slow moving film that eventually went nowhere woody allen is known as a classic director and that maybe the case but this is nowhere near classic it s mockumentary style of directing is annoying since it s not funny nor interesting and sean penn is just plain ridiculous as is his character in this over hyped film

boring chick flick there is no actualy snowboarding or skiing its a boring chick flick with a ranting sissy main characte 
like almost totally gross although valley girl came out when i was a teenager it somehow eluded me until now i bought it because of the favorable reviews and of course for the sheer nostalgia i won t say it s a bad movie but i would compare it directly to the last american virgin in terms of screenplay story and acting unlike the last american virgin however this film has an awful sountrack and it didn t really end in a notable way from a filmmaking standpoint this seems amateurish apparently this is where director martha coolidge cut her teeth because she went on to direct the remarkably good college film real genius just two years later the big problem with this film is shallowness we never learn much about any of the characters so it s not easy to care about them i still can t figure out why the lead characters were attracted to each other since the only way they ever describe each other is hot they never engage in deep conversations or share secrets with each other there s no depth to the relationship at all another problem is that all the high school students in this film appear to be about years old while the sexy mother of one teenage girl appears to be under years old herself a whole subplot that revolves around the mother beth played by lee purcell is unsatisfactorily resolved about half way throught the film then never mentioned again even so i like her temptations a lot more than stifler s mom in american pie lisa foreman s lead character julie behaves less like a valley girl of the s than she does an ordinary middle class teenager living in overland park kansas if you re familiar with moon unit zappa s song valley girl you ll find almost none of that kind of language in this film nicolaus cage s character randy is likeable enough but he looks more like a member of jefferson starship than a punk his almost mullet like hair is blown upward on top thats it unfortunately for an odd couple story like this to work you need to emphasize the extreme difference between the characters but these characters could have easily been neighbors from childhood they don t seem at all from the other side of the tracks the obligatory montage scene fails because it continues for the entire length of the song ill melt with you a montage is meant to compress time and dragging it out for an entire song defeats that purpose they should have faded it out after seconds for more effect the most entertaining characters in the film by far are julie s parents a couple of former hippies who were obviously the prototype for berke lander s parents in the hilarious teen film get over it the soundtrack too is terribly inferior to the last american virgin and doesn t represent the early s well at all only the aforementioned ill melt with you stands out as a great song meanwhile a tune that repeats the question johnny are you queer seems oddly out of place at a preppy high school prom from a nostalgia standpoint i didn t feel like i was watching an s movie at all in fact the most pleasant nostalgia in the film was seeing ashtrays on every table even though the characters didn t smoke which reminded me for the first time in years that california was once part of a free country and wasn t always ruled by neurotics frankly i was surprised that the orwellian thought police hadn t airbrushed all those ashtrays out of the film today every surface in california is littered with a fear mongering proposition warning stickers instead i m so grateful i was a teenager in the s rather than today overall this film fails on too many counts to recommend it but i wouldn t blame you for checking it out it s good enough fun for minutes the special edition dvd adds quite a few features that make the dvd worthwhile if you can get it cheap ! 
what were they thinking man i don t know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking but it should be illegal ! this is first off a terrible dvd full screen format with a dark muddy picture worse the plot is typical predictable and poorly written other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher s body sitting through this fiasco is a total bore i was also surprised at how bad teri s acting was in this movie since i ve seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this that is probably the fault of the director erik anjou a third rate director at best who has done a total of two movies and one documentary gee i wonder why he isn t in more demand not i can enjoy b movies and bad movies but this one is just so totally non involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at i can t imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher s current popularity and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger year old teri hatcher nude rent this if you must but wow there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad

throw plausibility out the window in this stinker we went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick much less anyting with jamie lee curtis it came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it whether the movies promised to be good or bad we went and had fun with them either way this one we had fun in how bad it was this was one of those picked on pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank only to come back with genius killer skills somehow attained super strength and the speed of the road runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play in short there s nothing to be believed in this stinker like a friday the th flick you merely wait for the kills and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends and pray for that to come as soon as possible the movie pulls out the stops giving us curtis for eye candy and david copperfield to amaze us perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect but in general this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a halloween type thriller there s too much stupidity from the victims oh until one genius finally puts and together there s too much not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison and given her presence there s just not enough jamie lee to make this crock worth sitting through we had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre it made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the s that got worse more predictable and far too numerous to maintain our interest this movie got that ball rolling don t waste your time you ll get more excitement out of watching jamie lee s finger nails dry for a couple hours 
lol if you want uncut original version always look for original licensed production not us release its a foreign film it should not be us version to begin with hello why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie s fighting scenes and us release ruins the speed and sound as well i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable and higher in quality american market always like to americanize and control regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way rest of the world enjoys it no one makes hollywood american movies to french version or chinese version this what americans are doing well enjoy the cheap american version then lo

very sad attempt at a sequel i rented this film immediatley after seeing the first bride with white hair hoping for a fluid and entrancing continuation of the story there was a perfect setup for a sequel and i couldn t wait to watch it unfold after the first half an hour i knew that director ronnie yu had abandoned the feel of the first film and it seemed he didn t really give a damn about how interesting the story was poor dialogue inadequate story there was nothing satisfying or even interesting in this film if you enjoyed the first bwwh you ll probably still be tempted to watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying 
so so i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it s cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in it ain t that much better on a whole 
disappointing this movie s plot deals with a no good wannabe rock star jack black wildly overacting as usual suddenly and by mistake taking the job of substitute teacher at a posh school right things like this happen all the time and using it to teach rock music to his students who are around most of the music is from the early s so probably not even the children s parents were born when this music was made i think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time it reminds me of another poor movie velvet goldmine where glam rock a marginal movement if there was one was treated as a major artistic achievement a la par with oscar wilde and shouldn t each generation choose the music it wishes to be represented with 
is this horror well dont know where to start bought this one because it has jeffrey combs in it stuart gorden is director and they did a good job on re animatorbut let me tell you horror freaks will be disapointed only one really bloody scene is worth watching not because of the blood not because of the gore just because it is the only bloody scene in the movie a nice looking woman is eaten by the castel freak if you have seen re animator the evil dead from beyond hellraiser and maybe the thing then skip this one you will be disapointed like me even a john woo action movie has more blood in it 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
bad baby bad okay it s not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion it does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis on the other hand the film lacks true suspense i was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn the baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum the pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn t stand up that well today the actors who took part in this didn t go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel why there was a sequel is beyond me i recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but i was only five at the time at the most this is a rent not a buy i guess good for it s time but perhaps a re make would pump some needed life into the story 
too bad friday the th wasn t lucky for this movie let s understand two things about slasher horror from the s first of all they had a legacy of saturating their own market and secondly they were simple stories born out of the twilight of an ever changing world with this in mind it would be easy to point out what is wrong with jason goes to hell the final friday however for the sake of time it might just as well be easier to point to what s right about it the answer to that is nothing ! all you ever wanted to know about jason is revealed and once you know the dark secret it will haunt you except for a small matter of cosmetics the dark secret is the same as the lemon revealed a short time earlier in new line s bad finale to the nightmare movies of course the only nightmare about that film was having to admit that you paid to watch it much the same with this piece of total garbage jason it would seem is not merely a specter capable of regeneration with a great rage at those who he feels are responsible for both his own and his mother s demise oh no the dark secret is that if you can find someone who shares his father s blood line cause lets face it his mother was not born a voorhees then you can see jason finally put to death or you can see him re born guess what happens here except the rebirth is anti climatic because he is nothing more than the same twisted mass of flesh that he was before he was blown apart by bombs and bullets at the beginning of the movie and apparently genetics has a preference for certain types of clothing and a certain mask because he is reborn with both in one laughable sequence you would be forgiven for thinking jason or as i d like to refer to him as the imposter being reborn meant the world would end however a mere minutes or so after he was reborn he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger who were the camp counselors who ignored jason as he died some ancient sumarian or egyptian people or something what s with the dagger that must be used why does it look like an artifact supplied to his niece oh this is a long story and is too tedious and boring to go through right now who finds the linda hamilton in her to terminate the terminator you ll be in for your just desserts if you think this repulsive piece of junk is worth even five minutes of your time of course there is plenty of blood and gore as the friday films always seem to have and there is also plenty to gross you out but if you think or feel anything towards the horror icon that made these films successful you ought to take a pass on this one 
kultur shock this is a total dvd disaster fom kultur i have tried two copies of this wonderful performance and both had a miserable soundtrack and opera is sound volume swells and fades throughout the performance destroying a terrific production would love to know what placido domingo thinks of it dr mirakle must have been the sound mixer 
waste of time i got this film because i m from detroit where this takes place it s a pretty typical revenge flick four brothers want to find their adoptive mother s killer usual smartass remarks guys talking bs fights shootouts blah blah blah i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch this script was mediocre at best give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe 
underwhelming to say the least i ve enjoyed more than my fair share of sundays in suspense about whether the jets would cover and so on so i suppose i had reasonably high expectations for some entertainment when approaching this movie of course i should know by now that s a terrible way to approach a film with matthew mcconaughey in it it s also not a good way to approach a film that looks on the surface like another chance for pacino to phone it in and laugh all the way to the bank lets not speak of rene russo s typically superfluous and embarrassing presence ok this sentence excepted why is it bad let s start with the acting i ve known sugared up rd graders with more pathos potential than mcc he s fair enough during the aw shucks portion of the flick which survives through much of the first act but by the times things start rolling and he has to turn into mr pr k it s all over he also suffers by comparison to pacino or course at least at first after a few minutes on screen though it s clear pacino s just doing his hey i ll see how over the top i can make this thing that he s been doing for years and the scenes become mutually embarrassing and i said we wouldn t speak of russo the deligtfully slimy jeremy piven who s at home in a movie like this of course is relegated to a c story and about minutes of screentime lets also talk about the script i don t expect much from movies like this but i do expect some exploration of and exposure to the subsection of society they re covering but aside from a few rushed conversations in mc s office we don t really get to the meat of sports gambling we don t really see everyday gamblers living and dying on every possession like happens you know in real life i wanted more of that another problem with the story is that it gets wrapped up in a love triangle plot hollywood i know we have to try our best to make this a date movie but next time at least make the triangle a believable and interesting one is there anything else yeah but i ve already wasted too many words on this film avoid it 
interesting when i saw the first quotits alive quot movie in the theatre when i was it scared me so bad i couldn t sleep alone for nights funny when i saw it the other night i could not figure out what scared me it is such a funny movie the cinematography is extremely bad but i guess it was good for or whenever it first came out this movie is not as good as the first and i m going to watch the third tonight i m expecting it to be equally bad 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
horrid movie i can t believe how disappointed i am in this anime i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad but it s not the little girl annoyed me so much i just can t stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie can t stop ranting yeah for those who haven t seen it you might like it like everybody seems to but i would not recommend it at al 
where is the class one of the most pretentious and exaggerating movies ever seen the dialogue the acting whatever all suck big time everything in this movie looked unrealistic not funny but pathetically pretentious and exaggerating to the extreme that kinda performance would have won an oscar yeah right maybe just because there were only worse pictures nominated in that year what a hype 
he was fired from gm for calling off and showing up late what a joke people believe the stupidest things do some research and you will see that this is a joke i hated it 
the book was great and the movie wasn t period do yourself a favor and read the book and dont even look at this movie 
lord of the oh i mean feet of flames this should be titled lord of the dance not feet of flames the two shows are almost identical if youv e seen lord of the dance then you have seen feet of flames there are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff my biggest gripe is that flatley seems way to full of himself in this one ! i mean he is so in love with himself its anoying ! i truely enjoyed his dancing in the original riverdance filmed in ireland but id say after watching feet of flames he deserved getting bagged on by mike meyers the sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show and it reminds me more of vegas show than anything else can someone please knock some sense into flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door that way i can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
a bit plodding but funny series of reversals a woman who lives in an apartment in nyc and can t cook and doesn t have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about she writes a very popular domestic advice column she succeeds until a navy hero wins the opportunity to spend christmas with her in her house in connecticut enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby problem is she doesn t have any of those things she borrows the house from a man who wants to marry her she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house and she even borrows a baby the unmaking beings when she tells the navy man her child is a boy and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it s really a girl then the mother of the baby takes it back and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one then the woman is falling in love with the navy man and he with her while the man from whom she s borrowed the house still believes she s going to marry him and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding its a delightful movie very funny and rich in both plot and character development unfortunately what probably makes it not a classic by today s standards it is a bit plodding it does not move at the same pace as for example the movie casablanca with which it shares some of the same supporting actors 
i found it tiresome my advice is to watch this in french which is less painful especially if you don t speak french in english its unbearable slow at one point the dvd froze and i didn t realize it for several minutes 
not the best of john carpenter this film is really sad sad because if you look at it closely you can find a lot of good ideas ultimately ruined by poor delivery and knowing this is written and directed by john carpenter i have to wonder why it isn t any better in a mars of the future a team of police are going to a mining village to get a prisoner and escort him back to civilization for trial upon arriving they find the village mysteriously empty investigating further they find corpses hanging from the cielings weird objects as they try to do their mission they realize that some strange force has overtaken the miners who have begun killing people wearing their flesh and having savage native like tendencies the force controlling them weird ghosts released from an ancient tomb ghosts that go into the human body to control them killing the person will only release them to go into another wait wait wait a weird alien force that possesses people and turns them against the heroes and when the person is killed it goes into someone else that s the thing and wait a drugged up force of psychos attacking people in a building that s assault on precint john carpenter you re ripping off yourself one problem i had was some serious miscasting pam grier was wrong for this role it s not that i don t think she can act i just think she s unbelievable as the leader of a combat squad natasha henstridge was another bad choice because i really could not believe her as a strong heroine hollywood needs to realize really skinny women with model bodies generally cannot do much in a fist fight in species it was ok because her attractive exterior was just that and exterior but here we re supposed to believe as she quite often very laughably beats up all these people five times stronger than her if you still disagree with me try to imagine calista flockhart beating up the rock i also have to say that john carpenter s filmmaking usually fitting to the subject matter is in this incredibly annoying for one whenever characters are walking down a hallway or approaching something they will dissolve between different points of the scene what was the point also consider that this story is essentially one big flashback told by natasha some parts are still taken from other character s perspective as told to natasha s character some parts still are taken from accounts from accounts told to natasha s character ! that s right some parts of this movie are flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks also the ghost p ov was just ridiculous imagine taking normal film and giving it a weird wavy red tint besides all this there were some little moments of ingenuity and i ve composed a list detailing them mars has a weaker gravity than earth being smaller than our own planet women are supposedly the dominant gender now then why do all the male characters still act egotistical shouldn t men be subservient and the women forceful now while looking at a vehicle with a struggling man inside pam grier hears a noise yells who goes there and walks off natasha henstridge doesn t notice her leaving and doesn t see where she goes even though she s like five feet away from her ! we find out ice cube has taken the shotgun from one of the rookies who claims he was too fast ice cube was like ten feet away from him did he move with super sonic speed during the jericho flashback when he goes to find pam grier he takes a few steps from the vehicle and sees a crazed native carrying pam grier s head this means within the minute and a half that happened between pam walking off and jericho looking for her a native ambushed her cut off her head and all right by the scene ! in a stand off between miners and the police the miners say drop your guns and the police despite outnumbering them and having superior firepower do so this is the classic drop em rule of movies whoever says drop your weapons first the other group has to do it i find it amazing in movies that no matter how far in the future you get radios are still crappy never go far in distance and are always easily clouded by a dust storm or any other large form of nature here s great military strategery you re outnumbered by a larger enemy and your route of departure is late so instead of defending your only way out you charge into your larger enemy allowing yourself to get surrounded and your route cut off a guy crawling on the ground grabs a stick of dynamite and when it blows up it propels him forward headfirst in the air wait what if the ghosts take over the bodies of whoever attacked its host then how come when ice cube and natasha henstridge are taking out like thirty of the possessed humans there aren t thirty ghosts coming after them ghosts can t go through doors and walls by the way the film gives a cliche plot turn lets go home no we have to go back and kill them all uh wouldnt it be simpler to go back to your superiors tell them what happened and have them bomb the place instead of doing it yourself oh wait then the film would be over is it just me or do a lot of characters get hit by spears and sharp objects and the weapons don t actually stick into them why is it everytime a grenade goes off near someone the resulting blast makes them hop yes hop im having trouble believing this was done by the same guy who did big trouble in little china escape from new york and halloween i hate to say it but ghosts of mars has the look and feel of a sci fi channel original film at the same time i want to like this because i ve always been a john carpenter fan because i like how a lot of these sets seemed traditional instead of poorly done cg and as previously stated i liked a lot of the ideas its sad to see the movie come out like this but it just goes to show you that everything that looks good on paper can be undone by a bad script 
being french does not mean you don t have to say your sorry as the director and actors of this mess should on their skinny french knees complete waste of film and your time not erotic sexy was that actress really a woman was her boyfriend really a man or visa versa damned if i could tell and that old man who tired her up ya think he had enough rope the movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through french people are not pretty and this woman was not only not pretty but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
daydeaming and fantasies can have consequences i found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives i was constantly wondering where i would draw the line if i was the heroine the experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy daydreaming 
a disappointment i bought this movie because i thought it would be like the movie version of louis l amours conagher unfortunately it is a far cry from that movie the quick and the dead was too predictable the dialog was stilted and unrealistic and the characters well they were too much in character and not believable i am curious how faithful the script was to the book if the movie is as faithful to the book as conagher was then i apologize to the movie makers and will hold a grudge with mr l amour instead 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
krull is dull for starters one witnesses what appears to be a large clump of x s floating out in space followed by a series of apparent environmental stock footage with likewise accompanying music krull is an action adventure fantasy circling around a pentagram like weapon which is the only instrument that can battle the beast who presides over an army of dark warriors called slayers and a dematerializing black fortress which is never stationed in one place twice after his kingdom is overturned a prince turned king by the death of his father sets out to find his kidnapped bride with the council of a wise man named ynyr which sets him on a trek to find the spiked boomerang a veritable shiroken and the black fortress along the way he gathers a small army of common thieves a fumbling sorcerer a decrepit seer with his boy servant and a cyclopse for an action adventure this film contains much too much unecessary dialogue extensive travelling scenes and a lot of climbing since the battle in the first twenty minutes or so the film remains rather slow until the last half hour wherein prince colwyn who looks like barry gibb and shoddy troupe penetrate the fortress and do battle with the beast after predictably dispatching a large number of mis aiming slayersin the end princess lyssa is rescued from the clutches of the wonderfully demonic monster and they re commence with their previously interrupted wedding by exchanging vows as well as a flame derived from water the typical good vs evil scenario exists here most commonly displayed in the conclusion wherein in conjunction with the penta blades this flame of love overcomes the blasts of hatred emitted from the beast monster this film seems to concentrate on more of a children s faerie tale type of story rather than a more mature version of the genre and could very well have been animated i suppose it may be more appreciated by lord of the rings d d type of fans yet with the exception of the impressive flying weapon and giant beast creature as far as fantasy actionadventure the film is unfortunately a rather rudimentary presentation this is one of those films that could have been better with such a great premise and villain but disappointingly does not live up to its full potential 
ick foul just plain foul seemingly never endingand not in a good way tasteless sick not even worth the beautiful faces heck i can t even write a proper review because i refused to finish the worthless trash couldnt tell you what it was about 
classic film horrible dvd raise the red lantern is justifiably recognized as one of the great films of the nineties and one of the most visually striking movies of all time unfortunately this dvd release by razor digital entertainment is a travesty the colors are dull and washed out and the english subtitles are poorly translated ruining the stately mood of the movie this is not how a classic film should be watched ! hopefully a legitimate dvd company like criterion will decide to release the movie with a properly done transfer in the meantime avoid this hideous dvd at all costs

disney why are you editing censoring the complaints about this dvd release are all correct great movie low qaulity release yet i m surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most the self censorship the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer we re ok to witness a pirate being drunk but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate what are the execs at disney thinking if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such questionable material as they did with many of the vault collection fine but stop chopping up the movies our ten year old children are not buying these movies many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we re being ripped off stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title 
pathetic excuse for comedy stars this movie was even more ignorant in a bad way compared to that other movie the stupids and i thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well the name of the movie dumberer explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is the old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh don t waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it s worth every penny for comedy fans 
great movie lousy video i was when i first saw black sunday it was very scarey and i thought about it nightly for months i think barbera steele was my first love i enjoyed the movie very much as a reminder of times past however the video was terrible the sound was slightly better than terrible i d have paid more for a better quality video i wonder if the expensive dvd has the same issues as the vcr tape 
beyond bad they wouldn t let me give a review of so a gave it one star the film is broken up into five sections for five different time periods but none of them have any substance to them there is a reason that this film was smashed pretty hard when it was released i ll watch pretty much anything but this remains the only movie that i ve ever walked out of i later watched it again with a friend to prove that williams really did a film this bad and it was worse the second time around there is no reaseon to see this film if you looking for a good williams picture get quotdead poets quot or quotgood will quot or even quotwhat dreams the book is better though quot this film is terrible but not bad enough to justify being watched to mock such as quotattack of the killer quot or quotthe starfighters quot there really is no reason to see this film 
don t let rob schneider steal more money i guess we can thank the global population for making rob schneider a leading actor by continually buying tickets to that deuce bigalow fiasco i could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn i guess i have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight this body transforming opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again but not this badly if the dwarf size schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he s been on a narcotics binge for months on end you might like this film i can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for lawrence olivier to be convincing the majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren t remotely funny girls having pillow fights where schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow literally the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it s the most vile thing you ve ever seen schneider falling down bleachers smashing his face against every seat a cross dressing eight yearold boy adam sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar he makes a cameo talks so low you can t understand a word he s saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer two things make this film at least worth watching if you re as mind numbingly bored and desperate as i was last night whoever the foley artist was for this film should never work again pillows making contact schneider falling down rear end slapping its all the same sound it s exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below anna faris i can t decide whether i think she s really cute or if she s just a plain jane with large eyes but when i m thinking she s pretty cute she s nice to look at 
this movie was very disappointing this movie is strickly for the women now i see why it was made for the lifetime channel it was hard for me as a man to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters i was looking for a happy ending and didn t get it 
spinal tap goes folk a mighty wind seems to be this is spinal tap done in a folk medium unfortunately the gags and cliches in this film seem to be lifted as another reviewer stated from most of christopher guest s previous efforts to put it mildly halfway through the film i was half asleep and wishing a dwarf would crush stonehenge 
kind of aimless i found this movie somewhat entertaining although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience nevertheless the film is about a whole host of young people dressed up and heading for a party ostensibly martha plimpton s party but they never quite make it there plimpton someone i never really cared for is actually rather funny in this role and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party and her idol elvis costello christina ricci and gaby hoffman are both quite funny courtney love paul rudd and janeane garofalo are also quite a trio overall this is light comedy nothing special but still worth the effort 
a good ole rebel new orleans i will not watch the movie andersonville until they make a movie called elmirathe camp in elmira n y the worst of the union prison camps had death rate 
brilliant actings predictable story i ve seen ethan hawk s best performance ever in this movie it was great wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me maybe i m not right but in my opinion this movie does not worth to buy does not even worth to rent but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it s soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally it s worth to be watch once at tv by the way i forgot to mention that this movie has a great cd soundtrack really great worth to buy 
movie great dvd substandard the sound on this dvd is absolutely horrible the dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering i also have the vhs on which the sound is perfect so i can still watch this wonderful movie but i would sure like to get my money back for the dvd 
not the best to be quite honest although there was a stunning cast the plot was gory it was sweet and had it s element of romance but it was too morbid for me to enjoy if you are watching for drew barrymore don t bother she only appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards dean cain on the other hand looks mighty fine if you re after a gay man it s not the type of movie you want your children to watch trust me 
lol if you want uncut original version always look for original licensed production not us release its a foreign film it should not be us version to begin with hello why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie s fighting scenes and us release ruins the speed and sound as well i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable and higher in quality american market always like to americanize and control regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way rest of the world enjoys it no one makes hollywood american movies to french version or chinese version this what americans are doing well enjoy the cheap american version then lo 
super teen having been a teenager once i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however in pump up the volume the movie s attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero well played by christian slater cannot communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he doesn t use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim he treats the caller as someone who isn t serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure but isn t he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry folks been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives as none of these teens do merely escalates the generational gap and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
tootsie to begin with the movie tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic this movie is produced in new york the protagonist is michael dorsey and he is the most important character in the film the situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman for the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed by that time so there is where dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous he gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman in addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing he has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn t treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman the characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing the way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear women s clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work the stes in the movie are really well done and i like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man the lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated the costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting there were not that much music but it was ok this movie could be reall in life because sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job i will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life 
this is a movie after watching this movie i wish an asteroid would hit earth or the movie studio that put it out and what a lame th of july scene i hope the movie extras in that scene didn t get paid especially the putz in the white t shirt geeeesh what a waste of video tape 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
swallow the expectations for this film were high a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today s technology alas the movie was disappointing the characters were not developed and the were quite flat the action starts very soon in the movie the wave striking the ship and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop the course of the movie did not allow for any significant development moreover the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable for example all the surviving passangers including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period it is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable 
he was fired from gm for calling off and showing up late what a joke people believe the stupidest things do some research and you will see that this is a joke i hated it 
maximum overdrive seems stuck in reverse among stephen king s famous quotes is the one about why he doesn t direct his own films his answer not surprisingly is have you ever seen maximum overdrive that just about says it all the film has terrific material to work with but it is static and very poorly executed when i watch this film i always think why didn t he do this or that and why are all the actors just standing around fortunately king is a better writer than director impressions of a younger king fan my teenage daughter has read most of king s novels and agrees with king s assessment of this film her favorite film is creepshow which i introduced to her when she was too young and scared her with the famous line wheres my cake that line still works better stephen king films to watch to see better cinematic examples of stephen king s storywriting check out the shining misery creepshow or carrie none of these films was directed by king but each film better represents king s work on the big screen in creepshow he even stars in one of the sequences the death of jordy verrill and he does a respectable job of interpreting his own work out of fairness there are worse films out there but stephen king did not write the novels or screenplays for them this film though not a good representation of king s work is watchable for some and is not terrible unlike many of king s other films this cannot be classified as good however 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
a disappointment fails to live up to promise i m not a civil war scholar so i ll defer to reviewers with greater knowledge about the accuracy of what is portrayed in the film as a film however this one is lacking in many ways from hyper melodramatic voice overs to noticeably poor editing when combined with inaccurate history the disappointment is doubled andersonville was directed by john frankenheimer who created many good or great films one of which the manchurian candidate is a masterpiece with his resume i have to believe that the intentions of the movie makers were good but the end product a made fortv movie reflects an inferior medium a story as naturally powerful and important as andersonville deserves a greater commitment to realism and the drama should have been derived from historically accurate fact instead the drama was manufactured history was dramatized it s a film that deserves to be made again re written by someone with a commitment to accuracy and produced by a company more interested in the best available version of the truth than in pandering to an audience of supposed dullards with second rate pap when stories like andersonville are not told with excellence the fall into mediocrity is precipitous and leaves me feeling that the story should not have been filmed at all 
so bad it s not even good people were talking about this movie as if it were the next silence of the lambs there are several reasons why this is not so the dumbest cop in the world this character never calls for backup and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues at the end he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight he d never survive on the sopranos it s sooooooo this movie assumes you know nothing about the internet it tries to be cool by combining bdsm body modification and rituals but in the end it just makes all these things look bad it s inconsistent the dee snider character retires all his piercings for a few years and then suddenly they re all back in the next scene it s unrealistic where the heck did snider get that second dungeon from in just a day i won t even get into the gaping plot holes the acting pretty bad the dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood grumpy amy smart is totally wasted in this movie snider s pretty good though actually he s really good really bottom line you have only two reasons to buy this movie you are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a twisted sister tour bus through them with room to spare you re a snider fan and you must own this if you belong to one of those two groups go for it for sister fans they ll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song captain howdy street justice youve been warned ! 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
matrix wannabe this movie tanked in the theaters and with good reason the story and special effects are lame 
wrong pictures why oh why do you advertise the version of crime punishment with john hurt using the pictures from the version starring the sublime john simm i would download the version all day everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair either offer me the version i want or get the pictures right 
star to many wow was that ever awful ! i d write more but im busy cleansing my dvd player after loading that steaming pile ! 
sofia milos is all the money the order sheds light on a religious sect dating back to the crusades having survived throughout the centuries it aims at fulfilling a prophecy which would plunge mankind into a third world war in short the acting and the dialogues are extremely weak van damme and charlton heston really disappoint with their performances ! while the plot and the setting are actually very good therefore the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers could act and write as for the rating if you re going to have it rated r at least give it the sex and or the violence if not give it the proper rating i e pg overall far from being a masterpiece it just might provide for an evening s entertainment if in a really silly mood and or intoxicated starsif van damme movies is what you had in mind check out the legionnaire and timecop 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
how much did they spend on this garbage worst levinson film i ve seen since envy i actually wish they had given us director commentary on this disc because i would have listened to a little of it just to see what barry levinson was thimking and i would cross my fingers and hope he would blame the whole thing on a really bad drug trip take a look at the man s filmography and tell me if you think this absolute disgrace belongs there worse he wasn t alone someone else liked the idea enough to co write it everyone else can blame a large paycheck but levinson actually came up with the idea this is one of the most beautiful terrible films i ever seen if they took one tenth of the imagination they put into the set and toy designs and invested it into the screenplay they might have had a movie 
disappointed i was very disappointed in this video keb mo was good but there was very little of him playing actually there was very little playing by anyone the interviews were fine but you find yourself waiting for the music to start and when it did it didn t last it is alright not great by any means i would be hard pressed to buy it for more than a couple dollars 
out of reach out of ideas out of patience outta here on the trail of stinky excrements such as the foreigner and out for a kill current reigning straight tovideo monarch steven seagal returns to again inflict upon his ever dwindling fan base more of his patented scowls unsubtle enviromental messages and his ridiculous past prime brand of martial arts steven seagal half heartedly and even that might be giving him too much credit portrays william lansing a former special ops agent turned wildlife refuge environmentalist who travels to poland to look into why his yearold orphaned buddy irina morawska has stopped corresponding maybe she found out seagal s years old and is a slug lansing unearths a slimy but lucrative slavery ring and comes face to face with malignant main baddie faisal it now only remains to see how grisly a fate faisal will have at the chubby but deadly hands of lansing out of reach is utter crapola the amateurish production values the corny highly derivative script and the cringe worthy acting performances cause this video release to plummet faster than an ugly prostitute s self respect seagal s mumbled diction is at an all time low at certain points a voice actor had to dub seagal s voice because the green peace sensei couldn t be bothered to come back to the studio for post production work its so obviously not him doing the voice over reading those letters to irina the action sequences are so preposterous and so clumsily set up that even david carradine is giggling i was such a big fan of seagal when he first exploded on the scene in above the law back then he was the epitomy of the film action hero more down to earth than van damme and more realistic than ah nold his first five features were awesome stripped down virtuoso cinemas of abrupt lethal down anddirty ass kicking in the s the fact that he was a man of monosyllabic tendencies only contributed to his cultivated silent but deadly image he was well on his way to becoming a martial arts icon then sadly pfffft obviously seagal found out that he could still make beaucoup money without putting in a percent effort over the years the man had just let himself go and it s a damn shame true he never was much of an actor he probably uses his burger king cash card more often than his sag card but now even the low rent genre he toils in should be embarassed to have him as a member is it a surprise anymore when we find in whatever film he s in that his character has had special super duper combat training in his past first of all if steven seagal were to now play a role other than that of an ex military name taker and ass kicker his jabba the hut sized noggin would probably explode from the unexpected dramaturgical exertion and all we ll have left of seagal is the desolate remnants of a ponytail his acting is now as strained and forced as his trousers belt must be this is not the worst movie i ve ever seen i once walked out of a dolph lundgren flick the red scorpion i think it was but it s pretty bad for the record seagal has almost officially surpassed the unlamented michael dudikoff in terms of film careers rapidly circling into the toilet one and a half stars the rating would be lower but i m sentimental 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download

what this movie was so stupid everyone listens to nina when she is clearly messing with their lives they are stupid enough to believe her and well i don t even know what else happens cause i saved myself and changed the channel 
not far enough the wisdom of menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman s body during and after ovarian failure menopause this book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause ovarian failure while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace i don t believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
the book is so much better i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it and absolutely loved it ! it is so smart funny and heartbreaking without ever being sappy so naturally i was curious about the movie too i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too not much could go wrong and while the story line followed the book more or less the movie turned out terrible i could not have been more disappointed first of all jack nicholson is completely miscast because he essentially plays himself as usual not the interesting guy that mark is supposed to be he is the opposite of charming funny tender lovable i e somebody that the character of the wife rachel would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely you suspect all along that he is a cad therefore rachel s utter shock at his betrayal doesn t make sense besides he is too old for the role ! meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy but much better in her role as rachel still she can t carry the movie alone and her love scenes with nicholson are flat there is no spark there i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel and whether she really did write all the scenes the wedding scene where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like hours in a room alone agonizing while the wedding guests wait is out of place not to mention boring not to mention heavy handed a total dud 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
it watched it on fast forward except for two cuties william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard on 
a politically correct melodrama a definite stinker waste of money waste of time well known cast amateurish direction plotless politically correct to the point of being stupid the film s incessant attempts at humor fail eric roberts character laughs off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film he is self important godless and emotionally false it s difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts passionate farewell kiss most authentic moment in the film lee grant s reaction to her dying son being carried off very difficult to watch through in one sitting because it s so repetitive and vapid you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments if you choose to waste your time with this film you ll be sorry you did 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
boring to watch the actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking the story is too unbelievable too it was a waste of my money to buy it 
sour note no wonder they didn t produce any other live action productions of dr seuss books until after his death this film gave me a headache the direction and pacing of the film is flat the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring inexplicably nominated for an oscar ! the acting was wooden the sets were garish and ugly at least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of dr seuss works were i think dr seuss works best in small doses like the short animated tv shows that were made some thirty odd years ago do check out the gerald mcboing boing cartoon thats included on the disc it contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than dr t does in ninety minutes 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
trite i agree with other reviewers that all the supposedly deep and thought provoking issues presented in this film will machines ever think and become self aware will they have emotion should they then be considered living beings and have the same rights as humans have been done before with the character data on star trek as one of many examples there is nothing new in this movie and it s not done well the humor is forced how does one ush asks andrew just hilarious i thought after years of learning he would have absorbed common english words the dramatic moments were anything but it was supposed to be a big deal when andrew said i will instead of one will how hard is it program him to say i from the beginning the one business was extremely irritating in the end this film was mostly a collection of sci fi and pseudo sociology and it was not saved by robin williams okay but hardly great performance instead of recycling these old tired themes the filmmakers could have addressed a much more real and disturbing question when robots are built that are capable of performing many tasks currently done by humans and that day might be approaching with frightening rapidity how tremendous will the economic and social shockwaves be

who would want to kill the sweetest woman in the world i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why don t you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichd rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i hadn t forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was fast furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he s a refugee from the outsiders but the movie s not a total wash after all it s got a great soundtrack 
total utter nonsense this is pure drivel clearly there was some kind of argument behind this film like the director wasnt given enough money to make it so he thought you know what im going to spite the film company by making a hideousely awful film thatll show them the quotplotquotif i can re tell it without vomiting is thus a plane is struck by lightning and kills all the pilots i kind of lost what was going on after that the ending if there actually was one was that whatever predicament they were in they got out of where can i begin clearly no one involved with this project has any knowledge of basic physics as they d have pointed out that this isnt possible im a little bit rusty on my physics but isnt it called a faraday coil if not then forgive me my minds a little indestinct but the main point is a bolt of lightning wont pass through a plane quotwhat about the glass it passed through the glass window quot you bark smugly well thick glass used for this wouldnt allow electric current to pass through it think about it people you ever been hit by lightning indoors have you ever heard of this happening in real life before nobecause it cant well done youre learning anywayenough of the banter the film struggles from then on in for some bizzare reason the plane operated by a laptop the cable for which has broken it only works by some guy holding it with venom factor into this some wierd pregnant woman type nonsense some shouting passengers helpful people arguing rubbish a hint of romance between a quotcriminalquot and a quotfemale human being quotand you have this godawful tripe of a film some wonderfully hilarious moments guy says quoti skipped bail quotquotare you a criminal quot she asks well of course he is you stupid fool he just told you any time there was quotturbulencequot the camera was wobbled about a bit and the quotactorsquot moved around unconvincingly the terrible news report segments where hilarity prevailed every time the bit when the dog jumped out the car that was brilliant he pushed it over a bit then it was half dead then later he gave the oxygen mask great all the scenes involving the radar room they were something else the ending also the rubbish cgi aeroplane what a laugh i could go on and on and on pointing out rubbish but funny things about this film but i think ive said enough in short dont come to watch this if you want a coherent engaging film but if you enjoy laughing through mind bogglingly bad trash then this is definately for you i laughed nearly all the way through it so at least it was entertaining out of 
to the writer of the review entitled an especially prescient film the many toubled undemocratic areas of africa don t have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the united states is destroyed whether or not he actually had the capability to do so the leader of iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability but thanks for commenting as for the film i know it won a couple oscars and all but i just didn t like it i thought the editing was poor that the scenes were long and often unnecessary although the story was good a modern director would have put it together a lot better 
far and away very disappointed because i can t watch it on my dvd player i would have asked for a refund and returned it but don t know how to go about doing that on amazon 
very dreamy very empty theodore dreiser has never been one of my favorite writers and his novel an american tragedy although rooted in fact always felt too pat and mechanical but at least the original never stacked the deck as badly as this lumbering self important film version does the heartbreak of the original is that the factory girl that the main character kills in an attempt to achieve his social ambitions is at least as charming perhaps more so than the rich girl he covets as his stepping stone to the good life and in joseph von sternberg s early s film of the book that girl was played by the radiant sylvia sydney the theorem of the story of course is that having to be married to her while only making a factory worker s salary would be such a grind and a misery that the pair would be miserable and hate one another in very short order well maybe the greedy ambitious quisling at the center of dreiser s novel but most men with any common sense would rather spend life in a cold water walk up with sylvia sydney than life in a mansion with any real life heiress and the same would probably be true if shelley winters were allowed to be her actual ebulliant self in the same role but george stevens who directed this version wanted a shrill drab harpie who would have driven men away even if she had just inherited several million dollars the rich girl on the other hand is played by elizabeth taylor at her loveliest and most luminous this is not a fair fight and the film cheats in other ways the protagonist is now played by montgomery clift at the height of his soulful handsomeness and although he could have played his character as cold weak and self absorbed if you doubt this check out his performance as morris townsend in the heiress where he brings the chill of henry james novel washington square to the tidied up proceedings stevens and his screenwriters michael wilson and harry brown were apparently having none of this george eastman is now a doomed romantic hero and so his murder of winters becomes an accident even though he did mean to kill her but chickened out on it and although he and taylor did achieve a marvellous sort of rapport at times william mellor s soft focus photography didn t hurt it makes what should be a much more ambiguous relationship into the stuff of adolescent daydreams and whatever the faults of the original material it was much more of a nightmare

refund please if i knew at the time i saw this movie that a lot of theaters give back refunds i sure would have gotten one at least the popcorn was good ! since i love adrien brody i will give him another chance this movie was nuts skipping between scenes you really had to be on your toes to figure out what in the world was happening 
for lana clarkson fans only an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in and out of some skimpy outfits she s completely gorgeous but even she can t save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
okay i agree with david thomson when he says few audiences in the west would be content to view an american epic composed solely of battles and their contexts kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the west was entrenched with kagemusha and ran he knew what american audiences think of as heroic and mystical about historical japan kurosawa s art takes a great deal on its impetus from what americans or westerners imagine about japan he was not popular in japan where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded hence the suicide attempt i am not saying that the work is rubbish there is no ugly shot in either ran or kag merely that there are more authentically japanese films out there to choose from 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show

save your money this film is just awful the plot seems to suggest that if your husband abused you you re entitled to rob a stage and pistol whip any man who abuses women and if you caused an accident that crippled your brother you are also entitled to steal money to give your brother what he wants linda florentino plays an abused wife who becomes a gun toting stage robber with a very sarcastic mouth bad dialog and a silly looking outfit and she is the heroine craig sheffer steals money sleeps with whores wears a silly looking hat covering a silly haircut and he is our hero sam elliott looks like he d rather be somewhere else and he should have been all in all a very poor western 
the tommyknockers got ahold of this movie and put their own little spin on it going to split this into reviews one based on it from the book the other just based on the movie in general the book the tommyknockers is set in the town of haven maine where strange thing s start to happen to the townspeople after bobbie anderson find s a large mysterious object in the woods behind her farm curious she starts digging it up and with each shovel full of removed dirt open s up a terrifying and life altering experience for all those involved the movie based on the stephen king novel starsi watched the movie after reading the book my own personal rule and though at time s felt like they were true to the book was often left going huh at the changes that were implemented certain thing s are left out while replaced by hollywood s cheap imagination the missing teeth as well as the batteries and inventions running off them never really hit home and though the book had a multitude of characters who had important part s of the story we see some simply vanish and never make it to the mini series perhaps the tommyknockers got to them first ! since it was a miniseries and ran over hours there was no reason to chop and hack this thing up and replace it with alternate scenarios and a different ending i was disappointed to see how hilly was found as well as the fate of gard and the ship and marge s ultimate destiny comes out differently as well the movie in general without comparing it to the book starsmargie helgenberger and jimmy smit s do a very good part cast as bobbie and gard the overall pace of the mini series roll s along well and the production and directing is okay the sound is good and set s the mysterious mood that the town of haven is faced with disappearing people mysterious inventions run off batteries and a mob like atmosphere are all displayed as we wait to see who the tommyknockers are and what exactly they want with the townspeople of haven an excellent cast overall considering the many various character s that had to be portrayed in the story 
lousy lousy lousy contentwise i won t toss darts or roses this is genre stuff you either like it or you don t my beef is with the technical quality it is execrable it is not in widescreen cinemascope which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular there is simply no excuse for cranking out a full screen treatment in a dvd issued in the year the so called digital remastering must be kitchen table grade because the shapes are fuzzy colors oversaturated visuals mushy this dvd should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted i get better quality from my vhs of this movie than the dvd i purchased lousy lousy lousy as i said 
but why is it called belly the american dream is an appealing myth no doubt the idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in america sounds great the problem as george carlin put it is that you have to be asleep to believe in it so instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs and that is where belly comes in an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it this urban drama stars dmx perpetually rapping nas and method man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies the story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs when the plot does poke its head up i picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from queens to omaha once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot one couple tries to escape to africa but find it easier said than done and tommy dmx is sent on a mission to kill a minister but really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn t even exist come on now i ve known drug dealers in my day and they didn t live in large gaudy mansions rap stars do rather they live in shacks or their parent s basement if my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is the directing by hype williams isn t that bad he is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks the lighting never seems quite right but i m gonna let that one slide as a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films i can hardly complain about their presence here there people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions all that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that i am going to give it as the most nihilistic person i know i am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used the n and f words are used to comedic proportions their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason and then on top of it all we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us sorry man but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn t make you any less slimy than those wall street hacks you re still a businessman this film is not worth watching any social point that is made is made accidentally and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta 
lack of talent ruins a movie that could have been good battlefield earth is an adaptation of the book by l ron hubbard while the book was a rather interesting story about humans led by jonnie goodboy tyler taking back earth from the psychlos the film has turned the story into a string of badly filmed action sequences with silly camera angles and awful editing the psychlos already have human workers before capturing jonnie this change in the story serves no purpose but makes the story even more messy the film then focuses on some of the story elements in the book but leaves most of it out including the entire last half considering this was a dream project for john travolta it s strange that he would let the book be made into such a bad movie especially such a silly one while the book was not without flaws it was actually pretty good but the movie is for the most part more or less incompetently made the director writers and editors all did a bad job it does have some entertainment value though which keeps me from giving it the lowest rating 
a poor man s above the rim fredro starr is a good actor in fact what ever happened to the group onyx but this film is cliched and predictable rhea perlman looks out of place this is a nd tier above the rim 
a waste of my time and money this movie is such a rip off of every sci fihorror movies that have come before it that i just couldn t enjoy it ! a waste of my time and money and i ll not waste any more time on this stinker or it s review ! 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
unbeliavable how on earth casper van diem accept to shoot this film i will never know it s a joke unfortunately not a good joke special effects forget it good acting the actors seem to never have heard about it a plot nosense what is this can somebody tell me the so called quotsharksquot don t scare even a three year old child !

a gun shot in the belly hype williams is the greatest music video director of all time this however does not automatically mean the transition to film is going to be a good one the movie is not good i don t know if it s supposed to be a black scarface or what but it s really bad rappers are not known for their oscar worthy work and nas and dmx are no exception dmx has charisma but he needs to work on remembering he s reciting lines not rapping i love t boz but she needs to stick to her day job taral hicks is a good actress but her talents are wasted here i don t buy her as a bad girl i know the godfather was an inspiration for hype but his attempt to give the movie a dark tint backfired he made it too dark everytime i see the movie i mistakenly think i m looking at a bootleg or something hype should start over in film by directing material written by someone else 
kathy smith fan i have several kathy smith videos never minded the outdated clothes hair or music because of the quality of the workout i ve tried newer more popular videos every year found the instructors prissy and their routines contrived i m a big fan of kathy s style and she never failed to deliver a truly effective workout that left me soaked w sweat ready to do it again the next day having said that this video sucked when i got pregnant i immediately sought out kathy s video among all the other pregnancy fitness choices and was sorely disappointed i think my grandmother could handle this routine on fast forward i get more worked up doing my dishes than this video i ve resorted to just doing my favorite kathy smith step video without the step instead 
should be on the list of worst movies of all time i would give this stars after sitting through about minutes i gave up on seeing anything remotely entertaining 
the big letdown believe me guys i am a fanatic of classic outer limits i remember when my mother would not allow my brother and i to watch because we couldn t sleep later that night anyway the story was very original but it just crumpled to nothing it started with a bang but why would a man with a beautiful wife do that to himself and he did it all for nothing i mean it s like the writers got tired of writing because the second half was very disappointing and the ending please a waste of human life 
not for normal people i thought my and year old sons could learn a few things about table manners by watching this video it turns out that this video is only about eating in extremely formal situations it tells which of your forks to use first and how sorbet is used to cleanse your pallet between courses good if you are eating with the president not good for the average family who would like to improve kids manners 
desperately depressing dalton disaster this is possibly the most miserable gloomy film timothy dalton has ever made he plays the king of piedmont who develops an inexplicable passion for a rather tiresome french countess she however is devoted to her rather wet husband and wants nothing to do with the king which shows from the beginning that she has deplorable taste however her husband s family want her to give into the king because he is making everyone s lives a misery moping about and when in the end she realises even her husband wants her to give in to him she agrees to become the king s mistress she proceeds to revenge herself on her husband s family by having them banished to their family estate but keeps her husband around to act as a lackey although the king is crazy about her she still insists she doesn t love him until in the end he loses his temper and gives her a black eye while i don t in the least blame him i feeel it would have made a more interesting scene if he had walloped her on a different portion of her anatomy she persuades the king to get involved in a war with france then gets ill with smallpox even after he has risked his life nursing her through the disease the ungrateful bitch still doesn t love him what a cow then she runs off with her wimpy husband and the king is reduced to sniffing her underwear it all ends miserably for everyone in the pouring rain it never seems to stop raining in piedmont i have no idea whether this preposterous film is based on true events and if so how accurate it is but the goings on in piedmont make the english monarchy look positively sane by comparison 
the cover and the title make you think you re in for more than this movie delivers as fans of starship troopers know the very name starship troopers implies a galaxy sweeping epic with lots of violence gore heroism humor drama and tons of big budget special effects this one is limited to one location his lots of gore but little in the humor drama and big budget special effects department one has to wonder at the thought processes in hollywood starship troopers was a big success sure it was expensive but it is also a regular staple on cable tv and it continues to sell well or so on amazon in dvd sells as of today which isn t bad for a year old movie one would think that a starship troopers would have been in the works for a long time perhaps a final push to the bug home system instead according to the director s commentary track the special effects director of the original starship troopers came up with this simple low budget plot that he wanted to direct somehow sold it to the powers thatbe at sony and they backed it provided that he slash his already bare bones budget even more so what do you get when you give starship troopers a budget that is only yes five percent the size of the original movie a bad movie full of special effects tricks that you are most likely to see in s sci fi cult classics the movie s premise changes from being a war epic to being a haunted castle movie a premise that the producers and director freely admit to on the director s track they also admit to it being a b movie and that it was intentionally filmed to go straight to dvd some reviewers have made comments about it being a poorly lit movie that was also intentional poor lighting means that the movie s special effects can be of lesser quality unfortunately one of tippett s other compensations for a low budget is to add more blood to every scene in the last half of the movie it gets silly after a while rather than dramatic the movie is derivative of several other movies and tv shows including star trek tng remember the plot that picard uncovered in which aliens were physically inserting themselves into the brains of high ranking members of star fleet well i hate to write a spoiler but xfiles same as a abovealiens there s a scene that just steals from the one in which the paul reiser character drops an alien into ripley s sleeping quarters alien the dark sets with a creepy monster about john carpenter s the thing the premise of being an outpost cut off from the rest of humanity while an alien takes people over one by one the scene where the general is chased into the base steals from the one in which the dog in the thing is chased to the antarctic research lab by the helicopter brenda strong comes to this movie as a familiar face but not as the same character her character in the original troopers was a fleet captain who died a horrible death in this one she is an army sergeant no one is quite sure why they felt the need to have a face from the first mivie but she does a good job and on the director s track they credit her with making this movie shoot a positive experience on a lot of levels that makes it all the more bizarre that her name is not listed on the cover of the dvd or on the back cover credits too bad her character was just about the closest thing that i found to believable in the whole movie i give this two stars rather than one because i found the director sproducers track to be quite fascinating maybe it should only be watched with that track playing i give this one a d it fails to deliver on the promise of the original in so many ways 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
like all gossip a lot of talk about nothing a very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level the movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue i ve heard better lines in fast times at richmond high thank you altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing don t believe the great reviews about this film the film might appeal to the year old crowds fantasizing about how cool college life might be with all the cool people and parties if you re not in that category skip this boring film and save both your time and your money 
syri sucka this film is boring so much so that i could only take minutes of it before i was forced to push stop this is a soap opera about politics oil companies it s weird jump around style is confusing pointless do yourself a favor and don t bother w this garbage 
beep beep chuck jones continues to entertain new audiences with the road runner and wile e coyote chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo i found it to be very exciting if you have road runner vs wile e coyote the classic chase from warner bros golden jubiliee karat collection this video might not be for you the other five cartoons actually appear on that video zip n snort operation rabbit hook line and stinker beep beep and ready woolen and able otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages 
charlotte s webb the voice on the tape is not very engaging however the story as always is great better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape an older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
you ve got to be kidding this movie is basically about yr old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what yr old worries about never getting out of this small town i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie 
femme fatales or very lame terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director didn t know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
and really the good info here is very good but there s so much more winded no where going storyline info that s so unneccessary 
creepy and disturbing i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i m not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth 
extremely slow utterly horrible movie i honestly can t believe that robert patrick wasted his time on this piece of junk movie ugh ! one of the worst movies i ve seen in quite a while 
here we go again i gave this movie star because it is not a true documentary it falls more along the same fodder as spinal tap it is missing a counter point from gm one could argue that roger had chances to talk with moore but choose not to one the other hand rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold i believe that moore counted on not being granted air time at gm for the production of this film an interview would have killed the tone watch the nightly news now last night march nd gm offered a one time buy out to some of it s employees the news reported that gm cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the uaw just like what caused the flint situation in the film this same thing happened in the late s and brought forth this extremely biased movie this film is entertaining in a strange way but should not be considered to be the absolute truth watch it with a grain of salt for what it s worth under close examination careful consideration andkeen intellect you will see a undercover messageyou might need to examine closely the content outwardly things are not what they seemuntil you look more closely many times the basic concept ismisread in the dialogonce you see this andopen your mind to it rational thought willemerge 
leaving las vegas elezabeth shue is always good but cage was pathatic story line droned on and on with a big flop at the end 
super ha hardly a glowing ball of weird light that turns people evil a computer in love with its creator two people go into a hyperspace pod one comes out pregnant sphere meets knight rider meets some bizarre star trek episode waste of time unless its late night television even then try not to think or you ll be very disappointed 
bad movie we saw this movie in gym class and it is the worest movie any one has ever see 
read the book instead the world according to garp is on my top list of favorite books of all time it s one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud but still really feel the emotion of the characters and the story really sticks with you i made a joke about an ellen jamesian just the other day lol yes it was a dumb joke that no one else got but that s how it goes sometimes i was introduced to the book in college well after the book and the movie were released but i had never heard of either one i read the book in just a couple of days i couldn t put it down and i chatted it up with everyone who would listen i ve re read it several times since then and i still think it s terrific naturally when i found out there was already a movie i was thrilled ! i ordered it right away but i wish i d never wasted my money on it s own the movie might be alirght but when you re invested in the book when you know the characters robin williams just isn t garp i love robin williams he s a great comedian that s not a question i just think that the casting for this part was way off base and if you can t believe the main character the rest of it s crap if you ve never read the book i highly recommend it ! 
pure crap this is one of the worst horror movie i ever saw i just hate it people dont waste your money renting or buying this crap if you want to see it that badly just watch it on tv like i did 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
interesting horror premise but moves astonishingly slowly the tenant is a film that wastes time and loses viewers long stretches of time where nothing happens something quickly happens then we are back to the monotonous pace excruciating to watch never have i checked and checked to see how much of a film was left the story sounds really good and gripping tenant moves into the apartment of a woman who committed suicide he feels something is going on with the building the manager and the other tenants slowly he begins to identify with the dead girl but the pace is so slow the main character played by roman polanski is so boring and unsympathetic that you wish he would just jump out of the window and get it over with he has a beautiful girl interested in him why the end which i won t reveal is absurd instead of unsettling mainly because of the duration of time it took to get to that point 
poor terrible all around bad movie don t waste your time 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
larry garfield is compared to when danny devito s plays larry garfield he is like taxi s louie de palma of wall street 
and now you see how our state was suckered into the oil biz i came upon this film while browsing my university library my curiosity was picqued since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking mardi gras and eating cajun food this film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in jean lafitte national park looking out over a marsh through which runs a large gas pipeline the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by exxonmobil shell texaco et al all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands if they re cleaning anything it s their own mess and what methods are they using biorestorative detonations i believe was the term used are those lifegiving bombs back to the film funded as propaganda by standard oil co when local sentiment was turning against the company i ll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled cajuns smile broadly at the blessed oil rig plopped in their marsh and the way the young boy is given the disney naturefilm treatment as amusingly naive as lobo the wolf or henry the mountain burro no just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state and then visit the beautiful scenery of norco la in the middle of the famed cancer alley 
let s make this short and sweet this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought ok i didn t see the whole thing it might have gotten better so i ll give it another chance bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what that s about as boring as this movie so why the star markup cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the rings and i do like viggo i did not however like this movie it s kind of fitting it should be set in a desert cause that s exactly where this movie should be buried never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap watch hidalgo you ll be out in no time 
did they read the book while not one of his best novels tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time ! jimmy smits does his best but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble skip it 
you don t fascinate me so shes either the love of his life or the end of it reads the tagline for fascination and that right there is a big tip off for what kind of movie to expect it gives the entire movie away patrick doherty died in a swimming accident but the odd thing is he was an excellent swimmer soon months to be exact his wife maureen jacqueline bisset is engaged to oliver stuwart wilson to the dismay of her son scott adam garcia scott soon meets his step sister kelly alice evan and believe it or not an attraction starts soon kelly in subtle ways starts to manipulate scott s mind and starts making him think his mother killed his father fascination really wants to be a steamy sexy thriller i can see it either as a cinemax late night movie or a wb tv series the movie even goes as far as to have the guys walk around with open shirts to try and make us or at least the women think the movie is sexy you could compare this movie to the works of claude chabrol the dirty secrets of an upper class family has always been one of chabrol s favorite themes but fascination does not have the pleasure of being directed by chabrol instead it is directed by klaus menzel menzel though makes the mistake of taking away all of the mystery of the film he tries too hard to spell everything out of us events become too obvious and thus breaks all the suspense the movie could have created that is a sign of menzel s inexperience i mentioned that scott and kelly have an attraction between them knowing full well they are about to become related fascination is now starting to open a whole new can of worms for itself as now it s dealing with incest the reason i question this move is because the movie just doesn t seem interested in exploring these people and instead wants to focus on the mystery of whether scott s father was murdered to bring incest in the story means that you are going to have to examine the relationship between these people fascination does not dwell on the psychological aspect of these people then we have the terrible dialogue it simply sounds phony the scene where scott meets kelly is an embarrassment for the actors the pick up line he uses on her is corny people don t really talk to each other this way the movie has problem with that dialogue is not written in a convincing way even the music is wrong it tries too hard to be alluring and sexy like the movie itself menzel is hitting us over the head making sure no one walks out of this movie confused while that is a very nice gesture on his part it really does take out all the suspense of the situation fascination has a twist up its sleeve that is just sprung on us i think it s a cheap shot you may not nothing leading up to this secret though is really suggested is fascination a really bad movie not really one is almost tempted to merely toss it aside as a guilty pleasure a movie that doesn t seem to have high ambitious but is entertaining nonetheless notice though i said one is almost tempted that doesn t mean that i m going to do that bottomline despite the pleasure of seeing jacqueline bisset the movie doesn t have much to offer director klaus menzel tries too hard to spell everything out for us but the movie then comes cliche and predictable the movie carries no suspense 
gaccccccccccccck terrible movie bottom linei guess this could be enjoyable for kids but anyone that was a fan of the street fighter video games will be revolted at this hideous piece of work i watched this with friends when we had a bad movie night and i suppose it has some merit when used for that purpose but it was so poor i don t know if i could even watch it again for that reason not recommende 
gobbledygook self righteousness pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie there is a certain new fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash but at least that was somewhat assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream motion picture of is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long hours and as much as i usually enjoy george clooney i might never forgive him for this drek 
full screen no sale i wont buy this title until they release the original widescreen version 
whatever this is an incredibly bad laugh out loud zombie flick that makes no sense at all bad acting bad dubbing bad but gross special effects and a bad storyline oh wait there is none it s never explained why the dead are walking again we have slow walking zombies chasing after even slower running people who predictably make the dumbest choices in survival in one scene they bash in the heads of the zombies with rocks successfully killing them then in another scene they completely forget how successful the head bashing is and decide to shoot the zombies with guns until oh no ! someone is gobbled up in a gross mess of red goo and chicken livers i kid you not then in sudden displays of dexterity these sluggish zombies move quickly enough to expertly impale their victim with a lawn spike lop of heads with tree trimmers chop down doors with axes and in the most incredible display of dexterity and teamwork i have ever seen in any zombie flick they band together to use a battering ram to knock down the front door about the only creepy thing in this entire film is the freaky bug eyed boy and he s not even a zombie burial ground is a stupid yet midly entertaining film that you should view with a group of friends enjoying a few beverages and or other refreshments while you catcall at the screen i give it two stars only because it takes about minutes before the zombies start wrecking havoc 
watchable albert pyun is my absolute least favorite director i hate his guts his direction ruined quotcyborgquot and was murky in quotomega doom quot this is his best flick and it s not that good in fact it pales in comparison to the so so original sasha mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable but highly forgettable the villain from the first tong po has returned after killing the sloan brothers from the first movie now he s out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother david sloan standard martial arts fare some choppy fight scenes but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck 
infested or a sharp stick in the eye take the stick infested josh olson its really kind of impressive that a movie this bad doesn t get shelved somewhere along the line and yet here it is in all its painfully cheesy glory on my screen daring me to turn it off i almost gave in to the temptation but i kept watching for you dear reader so i can give you a full account of the true horror to be found here the ninety minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back if you rent this movie and sit down to watch it the story what there is of it a number of friends show up at the estate of one of their high school buddies who s killed himself there s all the post funeral bonding stuff and everything s looking remarkably big chill when things go horribly horribly wrong thanks to vicious genetically altered flies that possess humans and turn them into soulless murderers yes you got that right as usual the only reason to watch a movie like this is the cheesecake factor any jo johnson plays the dead guy s girlfriend well ex i guess and there is an obligatory scene where she shows a whole lot of skin it is not however an out andout nude scene sorry guys there is also the gorgeous lisa ann hadley general hospital port charles who s really starting to look like kate hodge this is a good thing a very good thing youre certainly not watching for the special effects amateur even by microbudget indie standards the acting atrocious the script even worse the direction competent at best the cinematography ditto the soundtrack cheesy early eighties pop that should have faded into obscurity years ago or really anything else so it s gotta be the cheesecake and that s all well and good but you can do that on fast forward i strongly suggest that route at least you ll waste less time on this half 
a disappointment ughnot recommended for those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a s m relationship i would highly suggest the japanese film moonlight whispers over maitresse that film is a gentle coming ofage film with male sub fem dom theme while maitresse is a somewhat confused film about an ex con who stumbles into a dungeon and a highly unlikely vanilla relationship with a dominitrix the ex con cannot deal with her career eventually and threatens her to quit etc at some point you get the idea that the director himself really doesn t understand where the domina is coming from what started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through the writer director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection or pimp for want of a better word then we watch as the ex con in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray goes to a slaughterhouse where a real horse is shown killed onscreen strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly this image will upset you for weeks believe me ! i feel like it s my duty to warn you and the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots totally stupid like the writer director suddenly ran out of ideas believe me i really wanted to like this movie i ignored the negative reviews because there are so few real films on this subject but i was sorely disappointed and depressed by it if you need to see this film rent it it s definitely a one view film at best and it will be a film that will leave you angry because the horse scene and vaguely disgusted and generally bummed out too bad moonlight whispers is a much better respectful treatment of s m a film with real characters and nuance one that seeks to explore real psychological and sexual orientation questions while also being a beautiful film to watch that film deserves to be seen and a wider audience !

careful ! the dvd is missing sketches that were on the original vhs version first off i love eddie murphy in my opinion he s one of the more brilliant talents to come out of snl but it s a crying shame that sketches that were included on the original vhs version of eddie murphy best of snl have been deleted from the dvd version my particular favorite piece eddie playing a rastafarian singing were gonna kill da white people at a meeting of mostly white vfw members is not on this dvd along with a number of others have the snl folks suddenly become squeamish and politically correct i can only assume that such cowardice and overly correct behavior is at the root of such an obvious ommission after having owned the vhs version i can honestly say that i regret having purchased the dvd i would return it if i could listen to the other viewers and don t be fooled 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
big bird too whiney i bought this dvd for my daughter who is from china and though i think xiao foo is adorable i am disappointed by big bird s behavior not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way but he tells barkley at one point to sic the monkey king and then later again frustrated tells the monkey king to put his dukes up as if to fight to resolve the issue i am appalled by this big bird is also somewhat demeaning to the chinese people he encounters they don t understand him because he is speaking english and rather than explain the language barrier he just gets upset i love sesame street and although i will keep this dvd to hear xiao foo sing in chapter our daughter just loves her i feel i will need to use big bird s behavior as an example of how not to act 
this waiting waiting waiting is tough at the end of this film gene hackman s character strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug this scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen ee but also the listener hackman plays harry caul a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field he gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film more interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life he staunchly defends privacy even though it is his job to invade it he refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him i know that today it is very fashionable to criticize bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on the chilling affect we watch take place in the world of harry caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today simply because you are aware of bush s spying ways causes you to engage in self censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness and while that may not be healthy i m not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way while there are lessons here that deal with living in bush s america this still isn t a very good film this is a much smaller scale than coppola usually deals with and it doesn t seem to be a very good fit for him the script was original and unpredictable however it was also slow and filled with nonsense i watched the film twice and still don t have a firm grasp on what happened at the end also the scene in which we visit harry s twisted dream was a total miss for me the purpose was to show just had mad he had gone to me it looked like coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre unforgiven a dashing harrison ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten still this film falls flat most of the film involves harry trying to figure out the entire conversation the tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know big brother is using today i liked the way this film reminded me of rear window as in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him it is a theme that affects us in our daily lives every story we hear has holes and lies in it we have to fill those holes and sort out the bs to come to a perceived reality but what if we re wrong nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel if for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant and whether your ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug 
dead and bloated my second review as my first did not get printed as usual anyway i ll try to make this short and sweet i usually try and give credits to directors producers writers and actors in most of my movie reviews however i m going to make an exception here i ve read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd hilarious night of the living dead money color wonderful for gorehounds etc etc etc all i can say is it must not take much to please you people this is without a doubt the worst excuse for a movie i ve ever seen my most humble apologies to tobe hooper and mortuary the whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning why don t critics take horror movies more seriously well einstein here s a glowing example this is nothing but grade d trash horrible effects horrible acting horrible writing horrible directing you name it it s not in there this movie s most feeble attempts at humor come off as just that feeble i bought this together with dead and breakfast and i can t begin to tell you which one is worse so here s a little advice from me go check out a book at the library buy a book go to a real movie have your hair done have a manicure do anything but waste your time on this gag fest for all the wrong reasons of a movie another one that i would give zero stars to if i could 
doesn t do justice to the book an average movie with average performances glosses over many of the details in the book and ignores the role of many important characters it wont appeal much to the general audience and neither will it satisfy the people who have already read the book 
banality by any other name jeez maybe i am getting old but i really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest a brilliant scientist disfigured angry finds temporary techie fix for face goes to get bad guys fighting more fighting still more fighting ex mate learns he s alive he leaves her anyway hes too ugly the end more to come if successful not recommended

looks like a routine television program i am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent as for me i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay the fault in order of importance poor screenplay poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino who seems to be vying for the most over thetop performance the film was absurd in many ways from the outset the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans close up after close up conveying no meaning pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his not sofamous european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops first example they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that then instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling police you re under arrest they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source of course pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog stumbling around further pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from we must assume his quarry did the screen writer forget that pacino s colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit too inevitably and apparently not because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him as i watched this scene unfold i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already that pacino has fired on and killed his partner it was then that i decided that i had had enough by the way the european version with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior don t waste your money or on line rental queue on this hollywood drivel ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time the recruit which i could only stand for about a half hour too 
firefly excellent but buy it on dvd not unbox read the unbox terms of use carefully before choosing this route over a regular dvd purchase it is not your usual set of blah blah legal jargon for example c removal of software if you uninstall or otherwise remove the software your ability to view all digital content you have downloaded to the authorized device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all digital content from that authorized device without notice to you if you ever remove the unbox software amazon may revoke your ability to view the firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine amazon i ve ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience why did you let unbox create these anti customer terms of use 
flawless victory i think not three years after the first mortal kombat film fans couldn t wait for annihilation to come out unfortunately the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it i can see why first i will start with what is positive about the movie kitana had more of a role as did jax i preferred sandra hess as sonya a little over bridget wilson even though she did a good job with sonya s character in the first movie some of the fight scenes jax vs cyrax sonya vs mileena liu kang vs baraka sub zero vs scorpion were sequenced good the dvd bonus features were nice and the soundtrack was awesome these positive aspects however could not save the overall film from disappointment so what went wrong like the first mk annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie mortal kombat and ultimate mortal kombat unlike the first mk however the blend was not successful too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non existent aside from that only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return what else went wrong with this sequel some of the acting was either over thetop and or downright pitiful shao kahn s character along with raiden s character was poorly resembled also some of the characters didn t even get much screen time at all one flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off i won t say who because it is probably obvious while some of the fight sequences were good most of them were rushed and some were just flat out ridiculous this goes double for the animality sequence sadly mk annihilation doesn t rank up with the first one despite all this there is some good news after eight long years of waiting a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie plus the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of annihilation 
blah blah blah this has got to be the worst film i ve ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i don t have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he s sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i ve seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television notes this film had some great talenta song from olivia newton jon and one of my most personal favorites mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she s to good but why this film she and mila are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this 
on tivo not the widescreen version was very disappointed to realize that on my tivo series but i don t think it matters i got the version not the widescreen version so of course it displays windowboxed instead of full screen yeah i can zoom the tv display but this degrades even further the image quality not very pretty in the end is this going to be the case for all tivo downloads 
for the cover not the film i watched both seven brides for seven brothers and its documentary making of and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers particulary the incredible tommy rall looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film i came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb i decided to purchase the film then i noticed the cover i thought is this what i think it is and clicked on see larger image yikes ! it is i have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational to say the least after just having placed hands are not for hitting on my wish list if warner bros decides to change the illustration on the cover then i ll consider buying it until then for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see i suggest you view the see larger image of the cover before you decide to buy 
chomsky on chomsky i recently bought this dvd and was really looking forward to seeing it halfway i stopped watching it disappointing 
not bruce s best movie i really like bruce campbell and his movies like army of darkness but this movie is not in the same league first of all the plot is slow and boring bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move this really hampers the action aspects of the movie the dialogue aspect is not much better if you like bruce my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the tv episodes of jack of all trades episodes it is a lot more fun and has the real bruce 
lame two problems first problem let s say you re the typical kidnapper rapistkiller for fun and out of postmodern boredom you kidnap two girls off the street in new york city what are the odds that your randomly chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives or miles away one in ten million twenty million second problem the movie even with a run time of an otherwise short minutes doesn t have enough action or development to fill the void in short it s boring and in several scenes where craven seems more interested in the bucolic wechester county scenery than moving the plot along i found myself reaching for the fast forward 
too close to a caricature be advised that after minutes of the movie my year old son and i gave up goodman seems to have been given the license to go for broke with a larger than life approach that leaves little for the viewer to consider of ruth s actual life with the broadest of strokes goodman plays ruth self consciously the mis enscenes are without any surprises and hollywood predictabletoo little was shown to give us the sense of ruth asathlete and the milieu of early th century baseball a fascinating story that awaited telling but missed the opportunity here 
forsake your dearly departed or you ll be sorry b grade movie really poor script bulk of movie is boring superficial stereotypical real purpose of movie is baptist condemnation of the supernatural story line the wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit the husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife on the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life overtonesthe leading man is depicted as unstable self centered reckless irresponsible and fantasy pronebefore and during the two year period when revealed to the those assembled the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned his giving up the ghost is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life the daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head on crash with a car leaving her frightened and distraught media messages the film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo spirit contact is dangerous selfish and emotionally unhealthy the personal grieving journey of another should be co opted by peers condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact there should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like what did she look like what kinds of things did she say messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted in short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones in life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us in passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond when william blake s brother passed he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all many near death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves the inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds the same is true for after death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
dont mess with classics i give the original stars but why is disney taking all its classics and adding new songs to it i was so dissapointed when i rented this and there were new scenes in it i dont want new and improved i want the original the one i watched when i was younger 
the constant gardener i m starting to appreciate john lecarre novels more than i did when he was all over the bestseller list this film version of one was acted well but in minutes there just wasn t anything to engage my interest not its characters and not its plot a good cause worth building a story around but not this story i quit watching so i guess i could be wrong but i doubt it 
do not waste your time or your money while boasting an excellent cast and an intriguing plot this film simply tanks ashley judd plays the role of a black widow a female serial killer who systematically kills off every man she meets ewan mcgregor is the british intelligence officer who is hot on her trail for some incomprehensible mumbo jumbo reason he ends up being protective of her in fact incomprehensible is a good way to describe this entire film it is poorly edited and shuffles along at a snail s pace despite the excellent cast the action plods along and the movie is dead before the first body hits the ground one finds oneself having little sympathy or empathy for any of the characters in this cinematic fiasco do not waste you time or your money this one is a turkey 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
don t do it this is not the seagal of the early nineties something has happened to him and it s not good he s gained weight does not move like before and is hard to understand the technical process is terrible i will never buy another seagal i have of the old ones again and i think amazon should seriously consider taking this off their site 
yikes and eww i have friends who might be into this stuff if only because they like the old and the strange me i m just like is this its a wonderful life i think i might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if i picked up the script as it is this just barely seems to translate into a movie and forgive me for i have my own opinion city of angels was a good movie too bad if you don t like all this contemporary nonsense i feel like it worked my opinion it s long it s boring it s hard to hear even if it has a message i just can t relate to it so maybe that s my problem your opinion your own keep it you re lucky i gave it two stars 
definitely not recommended i m afraid that the reviewers who didn t like this movie understood it all too well at times it promises real drama and tension but never delivers there are too many character twists with no basis and the ending really does make the viewer feel cheated this is a really poor attempt at making a movie 
when hippies make movies i had looked forward to seeing this movie for quite a while being a big sellers fan and a ringo beatles fan as well had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be a fun and interesting movie it is neither perhaps you could rate it a curiosity if you happened to be a fan such as myself the idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both sellers and starr to shine but the script and story what there was of it fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to one strange setting after another ends anti climatically which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity it really does seem that they wrote it as they went along if there was anything written at all and one tired anti establishmment cliche after another gives good example why professionals instead of hippies should run with the good ideas in order to see them well executed 
highly offensive and sick first let me state that if you are looking for a women in prison movie with a good amount of nudity and the insensitive nature of what nazis lack of capitalization is intentional did to holocaust victims being as just a subject to get off on does not bother you you may like this movie i have no idea what i was thinking when i rented this this movie is about a concentration camp of primarily female prisoners the story takes place in one continuous flashback of a nazi who had been a commander at the now defunct camp this is barely a story of continuity rather a pastiche of attrocities committed at this camp but presented for your enjoyment one of the suggested attrocities includes a dinner scene where the nazis are having a rather unappetizing meal that turns out to be a jewish infant a jewish server upon learning what the meal is faints they put her body on the table pour flammable liquid over her and set her on fire while laughing and having a roast if one wonders if they were using this to show the nazis in a negative light then why is the protaganist of the story a nazi who is recalling fond memories but presented sympathetically if i feel that the makers of this film were anti semetic and were making a cruel film for their own misgivings that would just be an assumption unfortunately this waste of good film stock suggests nothing to the contrary the scenes i have mentioned are staged and are not actual footage just to make that clear bo 
age inappropriate opera is intended to be seen a true multi media art but a fascinatingly perfect stage setting aside this is one production better heard than seen sonically the performances please but this rates as one of the more visually disturbing casts i have witnessed a yearold pl cido domingo is simply unconvincing as a young soldier aprile millo as a well fed version of the ethiopian slave girl in ridiculous black face aida defies the costumers best attempts to provide a waist line and dolora zaijick mirrors a middle aged matron more than the egyptian princess amneris a fine performance by the ballet troup only draws attention to age and fitness disparities like an emperor the metropolitan opera stands as a respected authority perhaps this is the impetus behind overenthusiastic curtain calls which prolong the end of each act but the emperor has no clothes or at least they need ironing these are the type of miscastings which turn neophytes off to the idea of opera huge fans of these performers who can suspend disbelief may well be pleased but those craving contextually appropriate performances will find this one age inappropriate 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
awful this terrible movie has singing ! bad singing and lots of it ! overacted trite and boring ! all those good reviews i thought it would be campy and cool but it s not ! 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
jazzman a very deplorable highly offensive insensitive profane and depressing piece of garbage the dialogue is jaw dropping embarrassing and so horrible you want to coveryour ears also very pretentious and unrealistic justwhat kind of people enjoy watching crap like this theonly positive thing i ever got from this film was thesoundtrack by gato barbieri the great jazz saxophonist i wanted to smack the s out of that wimp french boy friend of schneider s brando s not much of a man in thiseither an artsy fartsy work for the new york la filmschool crowd i suppose give me cool hand luke thankyou 
histoire d eau this movie is more a curiosity than a chef d oeuvre french for masterpiece of erotism it hasn t aged very well either it may have been a hit then because it was one of the first of its kind although i am not sure coming from my fellow french men i was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism i found the movie rather boring expect maybe for a few scenes the total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some 
i turned it off half way through michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through the big one i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i didn t know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick this is not one of his better films 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
disney why are you editing censoring the complaints about this dvd release are all correct great movie low qaulity release yet i m surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most the self censorship the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer we re ok to witness a pirate being drunk but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate what are the execs at disney thinking if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such questionable material as they did with many of the vault collection fine but stop chopping up the movies our ten year old children are not buying these movies many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we re being ripped off stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title 
average at best hard to believe that sidney poitier went from directing a classic comedy like stir crazy to this music video not ready for mtv type of film very s campy it was corny then as it is now 
no story good cinematography okay music i watched this movie after hearing how highly rated it was very disappointing musical score over shots around russia or europe i couldn t tell since there was no story no words even subtitles just a guy with a movie camera recording everyday people in their daily lives the music was not good certainly not great even movies like the third man had amazing music not here so you have video and music with no plot no words even silent era subtitles like chaplin nothing if the music and video can t keep you interested skip this there are great films from this era this is not one of them walt d in l 
wes say it aint so i have hope that someday wes craven will return to greatness that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like scream cursed and dracula i have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like a nightmare on elm street or the last house on the left but alas red eye fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies first of all the flick is pg which means no blood no sex and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot a pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes i must admit there are directors that can pull off a pg horror flick but wes craven is not one of the chosen few as soon as the opening credits are over the plot has unfolded in my head yeah it s that predictable the main character lisa is on the phone with her dad while in the airport her grandmother just kicked the bucket and she is hopping a red eye flight creative title huh to visit daddy immediately you realize the old man has something to do with the story line and he is obviously more than a destination point while on the phone with pops lisa puts him on hold to speak with cynthia a girl that is taking her place as hotel manager while she engages on her trip cynthia has to somehow be a victim next lisa meets a gentleman that buys her a drink in the airport bar and the two of them just so happen to sit next to each other on the airplane he is obviously the bad guy not just because of the random circumstances but he has those bad guy eyes the movie is over from my point of view besides a few inconsistencies the viewer already knows that the father will be threatened if lisa and cynthia don t work together to make some violent action against a guest at the hotel now we all know that this won t happen because all crappy movies have happy endings that is why seven was a splendid film by the way the villain was triumphant the guy that sits next lisa on the plane will most likely be the only one who dies in the entire movie it s all expected and it s all dribble which may be why they made the movie pg no one over the age of thirteen should be allowed to see it this movie could have been saved if the villain had a better plan if he was more convincing if the protagonist wouldn t be so heroic if her morals wouldn t be so goody two shoes if the movie wasn t so black and white good versus evil it would have been tolerable 
nick cage in a bad role nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi

really really bad movie one of the worst movies i ve seen man there s no way to describe this movie slow boring unidimensional bad plot really bad acting really low budget in a bad way im not gonna get my time or my money back i bought it based on the reviews and they were really off even if you enjoy the gothic ambience believe me it s really bad youve been warned 
classic sam peckinpah it s been years since i ve seen this film on cable i decided to re visit this obscure film and see if i missed anything in the initial viewing as it turned out i didn t miss anything it s pretty much the same routine sam peckinpah film filled with lots of blood guts bullets and slow motion action it s also a long tedious film that is not one of his best but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra violence in their movies 
brannaugh blows it again bad although not a fan of kenneth brannaugh s i was willing to give his hamlet a fair viewing since this is my favorite play i was hoping the film would be better than his last two mediocre endeavors into shakespeare s plays unfortunately it s worse ! beginning with the performances jack lemmon is a wonderful actor but here he is an embarrassment as are many of the other actors assembled including julie christie whom i usually adore the casting is all over the map which makes for uneven performances and unsatisfying scenes brannaugh s own delivery of the text is rushed and usually unconvincing despite the vehemence with which he delivers every over ennunciated syllable which sounds manic bordering on farce bad direction and over indulgent acting ! it might be interesting to see what brannaugh would do with good direction instead of his own i could go on about my problems with the staging and other production values but the damage to this brilliant work is on every level and not worth going in to in depth the good news is that zefferelli s hamlet with another actor i don t normally like mel gibson is spot on perfect the actor s are excellently cast the production values and direction are serve the text rather than competing with it as in brannaugh s version zefferelli knows his shakespeare and his films in my opinion represent the definitive versions watch his romeo juliet and taming of the shrew too bad for us he didn t do more too bad also no one contemporary seems as capable instead we get the recent unwatchable junk with hipcool sensibilities argh its not surprising no one is in a rush to produce a dvd of this tragedy of a film 
indeed reality bites if this is the generation i am supposed to belong to i want to disown it ben stiller s directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage and are now trying to find their way in the world the movies messege is that we are a lost generation but that is not are parent s fault where this movie tries to lay the blame the kids in this movie are just lazy more or less and they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives indeed troy ethan hawke even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him winona ryder plays waify lelina who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends one day she meets michael ben stiller who is their age but has made a good career out of the tv industry ethan hates him for his honest approach to life and so the battle for lelina s love begins i really wasn t too impressed with this movie it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool tortured artist when they should get off the couch and go get a job 
great for the zen vision at first i didn t realize that you have to use amazon s software to load onto the zen once i figured that out actually my husband figured that out the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i wasn t able to edit the stars if i could i would give this stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon s unbox is great for the zen 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
not moved i m going to assume the book i captured the castle is better than the movie the cinematography is excellent and the acting is decent all around except for the lead character played by romola garai in her most dramatic scene a confrontation with her father she played out her emotions in an over slow melodramatic manner like a bad bad stage play i ll give her a break because this is one of her first films but thank goodness bill nighy carried the rest of the scene the funny thing is when you listen to romola during her interview in the special features you think why couldn t we get this part of you in the film she s an intelligent and witty woman but her performance as the lead character was just underwhelming that s a horrible shame the lead always sets the tone for the film this would explain why the movie seemed to drag i found this film to be a bore despite the wonderful talent 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
being french does not mean you don t have to say your sorry as the director and actors of this mess should on their skinny french knees complete waste of film and your time not erotic sexy was that actress really a woman was her boyfriend really a man or visa versa damned if i could tell and that old man who tired her up ya think he had enough rope the movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through french people are not pretty and this woman was not only not pretty but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience 
water logged whew ! after reading other reviewer s remarks i m glad to see i was not the only one who thought this movie was crap the cinematography is great and the look art direction is authentic i too had trouble following the double storyline just when i started to get interested in the modern day story the action cut back to the past i don t know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what i have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual timeline stories none of those were this boring by the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century old murders you really don t care anymore and i don t see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern day storyline in terms of casting i have to agree with the other reviewers why cast two british actress as the modern day leads to me the character of jean should ve been played with either an american actress or at least a british or australian actress with an american accent instead of catherine mccormick i also couldn t begin to identify with the character she seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it unless that s the point sean penn sits around and broods as her husband a has been poet josh lucas and elizabeth hurley as sean penn s brother and the brother s girlfriend really don t have much to do except add some eye candy josh for the ladies and elizabeth for the guys and believe me i kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit with and without the top some say josh lucas s acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role i say he has nothing to work with the character is just there to steer the boat and give hurley backrubs he has no real personality quirks and lucas works best when he plays someone who s a bit flawed he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading man good looks but bland roles don t suit him sean penn on the other hand looks like he s sleepwalking through half the movie his alcoholic poet seems more like he s stoned on prozac there s no passion even when he quotes dylan thomas i think this was a miscasting he s not sympathetic either spoiler alert his character s fate during the storm is almost deserved one cannot feel sympathy for him the story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut up flashbacks one doesn t hold interest sarah polley is a good actress but her moping around oh i m stuck in a loveless marriage and i really want to sleep with my brother again attitude gets old yes dear viewers i gave away another spoiler incest the other actors that play in the murder mystery story aside from polley and the great ciaran hinds as the wrongly accused murderer are all scandinavian and i ve never heard of any of them before they do a good job with the material they re given but it s hard to connect with them as well perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings once was enough for me perhaps you also need to read the original anita shreve novel before you watch it if so i understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation this may be its biggest flaw novels can be cinematic in their themes imagery and their dialogue they become water logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories it also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines it s much easier to go back and re read parts of it when the action gets confusing 
jet what were you doing in this jet li as a contrac killer come on ! the reason why this movie isn t that famous is because it pretty much sucks it s just a shootem up bang bang type of movie no realy kung fu here 
defective filmmaking willy wonka meets dr strangelove in this one ofakind cinematic disaster barry levinson s longtime dream project emerges as a garish nightmare the impressive production design wears out its welcome after five minutes while a talented cast sinks in the big budget quagmire another unfilmable concept that somehow received the hollywood green light 
really bad italian cheese this is the worse cannibal film i have ever seen the film was just terrible with some laughable and very bad acting and the film was not disturbing as some reviewers said it was just bottom of the barrel entertainment and they recycle the same scenes from other older and better cannibal films you ll probably know the scenes once they come on cause its obvious from the way that they were cut the cannibals look different in each scene a woman named shiela is looking for her sister who has dissapeared in the jungles of new guinea and there are suspicions that she might have joined a cult or weird sect that is away from civilization the woman hires herself a guide and heads of into the jungle only to find some cannibals and a demented cult led by jonas who has controlled these people into thinking that they re in a better place there is alot of sex blood and gore in this film but it seems to be lacking a plot and a brain if you liked cannibal ferox and cannibal holocaust or any other italian gore films then you might be interested in this but be warned cause the film is absolutely horrendous and was nothing compared to the other two that i have mentioned 
politically correct retelling ruins the message although it looks the same as the hg wells story and the movie this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man s nature into a mildly fun sci fi outing alexander s motivation for building the time machine is entirely different and what he learns years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind that is if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time travel paradoxes so the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the george pal version we don t even find out anything about what we are about to see but things get worse is in the distant future although the writing tries to dance around the fact they have de fanged the harsh reality of the eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete instead of unknowing sheep they are new agey world culture pluralists the dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense and there is no rod taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts the only reason why i give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci fi films in years and i found some of the special fx the moon and jeremy irons cheesy as they may have been fun 
dreary hard to watch given high acclaims this film has collected over time i was glad to pick up a vhs copy at my local library sale began to watch it last night i was able to sit thru the part when the tape ended i was actually glad i felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part ! the movie is dreary to the max people portrayed are irrational lost uncommunicative and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers in some way this movie reminded me of the dreary winter lasting months i spent in russia a couple of years ago to me the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of soviet state for survivors nothing made any sense anymore except perhaps fear and evil as people in this dreary film reflects people have been already destroyed in their souls they are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience maybe that is the real meaning of this movie to really reflect what happened to people s psyche after lenin and stalin s unlimited terror they found a parallel in mongol s devastation and oppression of medieval russia in both cases people were left shattered helpless irrational withdrawn and autistic 
curious unsettling and highly questionable when i rented twentynine palms i knew it would showcase bruno dumont s taste for dispassionate portrayals violence of various sorts and shock in spite of this mental preparation this very atmospheric film built to a grotesque resolution that left me a seasoned viewer rattled unfortunately the shock and awe that the film achieves is short lived twentynine palms is modeled on the horror film but like many of its american cousins the horror it achieves failed to haunt me the film as a whole left me with an unsettled feeling as if a cynic had just talked my ear off i also had the sense that this was more about the worldview of the director rather than the world his film creates sam peckinpaw s straw dogs is in ways a similar but superior film i can admire straw dogs based on its many strengths so long as i avoid viewing it as the man asanimal fable that peckinpaw intended it isn t that i disagree with his view of humans as domesticated animals i see the film as a rare example of violent drama and technical virtuosity transcending the simplicity of its maker s defense whether peckinpaw has a point or not seems beside the point of course the trick with any argument is in having good evidence in pressing one s point of view there is almost inevitably an artful description of a scene one that reflects the viewer s position in this way films have the strange ability to create their own myths their own arguments to invest a film with one s views too forcibly can dull the work s independent life its peculiar logic with the sententiousness of fables watching twentynine palms it seems impossible to avoid questioning dumont s personal views this is because so many of the events described in the film are implausible lacking believable characters and action one naturally develops a sense that the director is revealing something to us that we haven t seen something unique to his vision if the strange behavior of the two principles was about their uniqueness and their relationship eg as outsiders then why would dumont undercut their characterization denying us a belief in them as individuals or more profoundly as points of identification i gradually came to view the two principles as an every couple with private rhythms and misunderstandings that might appear absurd if made public this seemed like a worthy focus but dumont forces it to play against a theme of violence both seen and unseen the violent atmosphere of the film was something i couldn t account for until the resolution and even then with difficulty toward the end of film we re given a horrific equation of two orgasms that of the male protagonist and that of his rapist the film s principle antagonist aside from the desert both orgasms are shown to be dangerous powerful and unspeakable or at least not clearly worded this equation discounts the context in which the orgasms occur leaving the viewer with no reliable distinction of the protagonists from their insanely hostile environment clearly the bourgeois carefree lifestyle of the couple is set up to be cut down a horror convention but dumont makes the attack personal in the most perverse way from early in the film on the protagonists suggest an inner horror which is unmitigated by their lovemaking and perhaps even feeds on their relationship the irrationality of their environment makes the couple our most recognizable guides on this strange road trip but they demonstrate their own measure of insanity the male half of the couple betrays an undercurrent of sadism that eventually explodes as an act of sexualized murder the female s deviance is less clearly defined but there are several scenes in which she is shown inviting harm if our trip as it seems is through a kind of anti eden and our guides are an every couple with no structured identity of their own then their deviancy would suggest a kind of universal infection or nature rather than an aberration of character this would also render the criminality of the final scenes uncertain in light of their amoral setting some would say that the best criterion for judging a horror film is whether it horrifies regardless of how this is an unsettling film it is also an especially tasteless one in watching this dvd it may be useful to some viewers that dumont can be found rationalizing his use of violence indeed his violence as an artist in an interview in a director s statement and in the course of the film itself 
stooopid movie i can t help by not like anything about this movie the actors seem to be as uninterested in making the movie as i was in watching it i returned it so fast it made the cashier dizzy skip this stinker trust me you ll have more fun at the dentist 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
why bother i find myself rehashing my own reviews at this point but nonetheless i aspire to write a review on each instalment producers have tested logistics to new levels by taking jason on a murderous vacation to new york the film begins on camp crystal where two teenage lovers are discussing the legend of jason whilst they speak of him jason is electrocuted again back to life by the contact of the boat s anchor more conveniently he finds a hockey mask on the boat to cover up his unsightly face cue two dead teens with very bad gory effects and jason s off on his way to new york cue once again a series of brutal murders on the boat with female heroine jensen dagett avoiding him at all costs until he reaches new york shores as a side story the heroine has had previous contact with jason when she is swimming in the water so she is frightened of the water as a result at this stage a change of scenery was needed but it doesn t work well at all what s so scary in new york comedy is used to no effect in this movie and again the death scenes are more elaborate can this unlucky lady stop jason in his tracks one more time will this beast ever die i rest my case 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
dark comedy still needs to have comedy i love a dark comedy more than the next person and laugh at things that i probably really shouldn t so i thought this movie hyped as a very dark comedy would be right up my alley sadly apart from a few moments here and there very bad things simply fails as a comedy and it fails as a drama because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic that s too bad because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them i fault the script which has problems at best and the direction and editing which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times you could do worse but this is strictly a rental at best 
disapointed i was verry disapointed to see this movie because i wanted to see the real movie and not a musical movie im still looking for the real real movie but still can t find it 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users

not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
excellent performance very poor video edit as other have stated the performance is excellent my wife and i watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show with that said my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did they used some kind of filter on many of the shots they change camera angles times in minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch you do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music i have to sell my copy because i get nauseas watching it i hope they re make this dvd i think my year old daughter could do a better job editing and we could use the additional revenue stream 
lost credability quickly i admit i haven t finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women s health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn t alternative enough for her ! 
awful painfully bad i want my money back listen to bob s albums but stay far away from this movie so many great actors but the story is nonsense the characters are just a random assortment of stereotypes unnatural dialogue poorly lit poorly directed poorly edited and bob couldn t act his way out of a paper bag stone faced frail semi catatonic completely devoid of charisma it s his vanity project but he comes off looking ridiculous even his musical performances are only so sothe movie was shot entirely inside a hollywood studio except for a few nd unit shots of downtown la making it look fake and crowded a case in point jeff bridges and john goodman amazing together in the big lebowski both appear here as flat irritating one dimensional characters its a bummer man 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
femme fatales or very lame terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director didn t know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid 
aims low and hits its target this straight tovideos modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison this prison only seems to house about inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it s resolved in much too pat a fashion however leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around and there s a torture scene modeled on the one in lethal weapon in which he s hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks mr thomas performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show 
just a warning i would suggest that you rent this before buying it ! unlike the reviews above it was one of the worst thing i have ever seen i walked out of the theatre on this and there were many people on the lobby that walked out before me ! this is not a film for everyone and requires a very special taste ! there was no story that i could see just a bunch of clips that made no sense 
unremarkable and uninformative here s what i learned from this movie oscar wilde was gay thats it never mind that he was a brilliant writer an astute observer of society s foibles a witty convesationalist and a darn interesting guy because he was gay and apparently that s the only thing that anyone should care about sadly the film doesn t explore any other aspect of wilde s life i wonder if he d been heterosexual if the filmmakers would have felt the need to subject us to so many graphic and pointless sex scenes doubtful these scenes are not distasteful just unnecessary how many times must i watch oscar fondle a young boy before it just becomes redundant ironically while making a solid case that wilde was a victim of a rigid unforgiving society the film itself falls victim to its own good intentions where once wilde was villified for his sexual preferences here he is nothing but his sexual preferences i wanted more i wanted to experience oscar wilde as a full human being not just a gay man even this falls flat his relationship with his young male lover is surprisingly shallow and uninvolving oh well oscar maybe they ll make another movie in a hundred years and we ll all be uninterested enough in who wilde was having sex with to actually learn something about his life 
the worst of all halloween films without the strong leading performances of donald pleasance or jaime lee curtis only in this for about minutes this makes it the worst halloween film to date much has been said about halloween i loved halloween and was just okay however danielle harris should have been in that one as well the series picked up again with halloween h but took another fall with this cheap piece of trash that was just looking to make a quick buck i would watch halloween iii which doesn t even have the michael myers character in it as long as it meant i wouldn t have to be subjected to this again the actors acting were terrible the plot and storyline was severely weak and the entire film as a whole just seemed fake and pointless it s really a shame when a franchise has to be ruined with something like this i felt the same with jason x which is set in space lame i m pretending this one never happened 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
for mamet fans only i couldn t get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking the characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do mamet appears to have never left manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective to be honest i didn t finish the entire film but instead checked the tv guide for reruns of northern exposure for the real thing 
very very funny this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen a must see so bad it is funn 
attempts to be provokative turns out ultra violent gore the ideas behind minutes aren t bad at all take one robert deniro put him in new york mix him with some american dream hunting eastern europeans on a killing spree and try to provoke some emotions and have a sly dig at the american justice system lets see nothing happened only repulse if like everyone else you plan on watching this film because deniro is in it you will be dissapointed he puts in a tired performance almost as if he knows the film is a load of b s the attempt to be hard hitting goes horribly wrong instead it s just repulsive over the top violence and its pointless naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces why there are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning such as mm the horrible subject of snuff movies hard hitting meaningfull film minutes is far from meaningfull we all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that but when converting it to a film it needs a deeper meaning otherwise it turns into melodramatic hollywood if you like brain dead gore and violence lack of plot and cringing melodrama go ahead 
disturbing to say the least i saw this recently and was to say the least very disturbed by the video surveilence of kell killing blackmon it is a very sad true life story of one very disturbed individual troy kell comes from nevada he has now no life he has not had one since he was he was incarcerated for a brutal murder of a man who was stalking and harrassing his childhood friend sandyhe committeda brutal crime shot a man six times in the head at close range this documentary shows the real inside of prison life allbeit through the eyes of a very disturbed young individual kell is articulate and comes across as highly intelligent but is he really he is now on death row very good documentary but also very disturbing 
unwatchable character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device however in most such efforts there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones we found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters even the bride who is supposed to carry the film seemed fake and unlikeable we watched about minutes of this dvd and ditched it in favor of something else for a much better quirky family movie wait for the family stone to come out on dvd 
snowboarding mixed with bullets and action dont mix this movie started out good but then got all mushy with the action and the gunfire good snowboarding stunts and the cast is great sawa looks a little scruffy looking like i said with the snowboarding and action dont mix well and it gets muddled when the badguys come alon 
shark from some other footage attack shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it s mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
super teen having been a teenager once i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however in pump up the volume the movie s attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero well played by christian slater cannot communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he doesn t use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim he treats the caller as someone who isn t serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure but isn t he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry folks been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives as none of these teens do merely escalates the generational gap and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth

noooo ! make it stop it seems like a good idea las vegas hillbillys a kind of a krush groove for the possum pie and moonshine set starring jayne mansfield and mamie van doren duelling blonde bombshells right ah no van doren is looking sad and puffy in this film as a tough but disinterested saloon singer longing for better days when she was straining angora sweaters and scratching out the eyes of good girls everywhere jayne mansfield sports a series of tentlike grandma dresses of the sort later found adorning the fashionable weezie jefferson reading from cue cards with a kind of breathy clueless abandon which is probably quite fetching when she s not dressed in a potato sack one can imagine her on her rendezvous with destiny thinking oh no we re about to slide underneath that semi truck ! but at least i won t have to think about las vegas hillbillys anymore between the two of them they don t get more then seven minutes screen time this movie is ostensibly a musical in the sense that there is music in it consisting of fifteen or twenty minute blocks of bad lip synching in an minute film which do nothing to advance the plot such as it is watch for bill anderson s all kgbagent backup band we are american high fashion models i gave this movie a whole two stars because they can sing after all give them a break richard kiel makes a surprise appearance as can you guess a thug he actually has dialogue in this film of a sort and in watching his performance you really get a sense that unenthusiastically bunny hopping between cable cars in moonraker represented the pinnacle of his acting career the plot woody weatherby contemplates stardom inherits a debt ridden saloon from his uncle goes to vegas tries to run the place has a twenty minute nap in the last ten minutes aunt clem magically fixes everything and starts a cream pie fight van doren kisses ferlin husky thereby completing her descent to the innermost circle of hades the end there was supposedly a sequel to this hillbillys in a haunted house but i frankly am afraid to watch it be my guest 
better on vhs this is the worst transfer to dvd i ve ever seen i think the vhs copy looks and sounds better do not waste your money ! 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service 
an awful adaptation the costumes were great but this movie did no justice to the novel cousin bette the novel is excellent cousin bette the movie is dreadful i understand some changes are necessary when a novel is adapted into a movie but these changes were awful and they took something very important the baroness away from the story if you haven t read the novel you will probably find this movie to be decent if you have read the novel be prepared to be very disappointed 
sterile derivative and plastic just like hollywood and just like the music industry which i guess is the point john travolta playing on his character from get shorty and to a lesser degree like his character in pulp fiction and swordfish is mr cool this time he s trying to make it big in the music biz he discovers a new talent artist christina milian and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters a brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar the dialogue seems forced funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae aside from a few interesting moments only one speech toward the end made by cedric the entertainer redeemed the film its like a big commercial which i suppose is any hollywood film certain musicians get shameless plugs steven tyler and aerosmith included in the film various movies get shameless plugs including in a not so disguised fashion get shorty certain hollywood landmarks eg the mann chinese theater are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the l a lakers and the staples center get a plug its an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or in this case making a musician so we watch travolta as mr cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give christina milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts the ending is so horribly cheesy i felt as if i was watching american idol watchable but barely the player covered this terrain so much better 
lack of talent ruins a movie that could have been good battlefield earth is an adaptation of the book by l ron hubbard while the book was a rather interesting story about humans led by jonnie goodboy tyler taking back earth from the psychlos the film has turned the story into a string of badly filmed action sequences with silly camera angles and awful editing the psychlos already have human workers before capturing jonnie this change in the story serves no purpose but makes the story even more messy the film then focuses on some of the story elements in the book but leaves most of it out including the entire last half considering this was a dream project for john travolta it s strange that he would let the book be made into such a bad movie especially such a silly one while the book was not without flaws it was actually pretty good but the movie is for the most part more or less incompetently made the director writers and editors all did a bad job it does have some entertainment value though which keeps me from giving it the lowest rating 
classic film horrible dvd raise the red lantern is justifiably recognized as one of the great films of the nineties and one of the most visually striking movies of all time unfortunately this dvd release by razor digital entertainment is a travesty the colors are dull and washed out and the english subtitles are poorly translated ruining the stately mood of the movie this is not how a classic film should be watched ! hopefully a legitimate dvd company like criterion will decide to release the movie with a properly done transfer in the meantime avoid this hideous dvd at all costs 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
welcome to the suck i want my two hours back this film struggles to find an audience i cannot imagine that it will inspire anyone to join the military at least the fictional one it portrays furthermore it s message is utterly ambiguous much less than what the veiwer deserves for putting up with its boorish crassness skip this one 
pervasive silicone enhancement flat lighting cheap sets and costumes dull dialog wooden acting and a goofy plot even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie zero stars should be an option for more inspired soft porn check out the work of andrew blake andrewblakecom 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
no need to suicide i get the story line but grown women need to suicide the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself it is not matching the character 
good story b movie the story is set in late but is unbelievable due to bad costumes and worse acting a decent plot exploring the relationship between man and his enemy may be enough to keep the watcher awake but maybe not 
same episodes again as most people have stated this dvd has or episodes that are already available on other scooby compilations we fans have to figure out how to petition warner if we want to see other episodes released 
disappointed i bought the dvd based on all the positive reviews and i think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a star movie my husband and i who love old movies hated it my teenagers just found it completely uninteresting it was apparently made about the time alaska became a state although it deals with an earlier time period and the movie has not aged well the story was uninteresting the direction was uneven the comedy mostly bar fights felt forced and awkward stewart granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there fabian s acting was unmemorable and we felt capucine was miscast we got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like alaska it was obviously shot in southern california i gave it two stars because i was able to sit through the entire thing but i spent most of it asking myself why why am i wasting my time like this 
who s that knocking in the woods the tommyknockers is one of the more unsuccessful of stephen king adaptations to hit the screen originally a tv miniseries the movie suffers from lackluster direction mediocre performances and no sense of true suspense or horror typically set in a homey little new england town the plot centers on the discovery of a mysterious object in the woods by a local writer marg helgenberger who along with her alcoholic poet boyfriend a poorly cast jimmy smits decides to keep it a secret until the whole thing is unearthed meanwhile a ghostly green light emits from the object causing the townspeople to go bonkers in one form or another whether it be by inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around with glowing green eyes at three hours the tommyknockers definitely overstays its welcome and that is one problem in watching a miniseries in one take it can become redundant tighter direction and a more focused cast could have helped but aside from john ashton eg marshall and joanna cassidy in supporting roles most of the performances seem phone in and traci lords is ridiculously hilarious as the postal slut a real misfire 
horrible i went to see this movie when it first came out and i nearly fell asleep watching it this movie is not worth watching it s so fake it s easy to tell whats going to happen next 
the itsy bitsy problem by the time you see the ending you ll already be wishing that you hadn t watched this movie 
not the original version this has already been expressed here in the reviews but just as a reminder one more time this dvd is not the original version the original version has more material and is much better hopefully someday they ll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time 
defective recording this recording is simply defective it opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording and boy they are not kidding this is not a simple case of vhs quality on a dvd instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the moon landing and the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders complete with pitch shifts it is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame some example frames at vienneseball dot org slash piratesthis is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance i am immediately returning this to amazon this recording should never have been released 
edited version this version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the dvd and listed in the imdb i saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie the dvd packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by amazon they made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done i do not recommend this version to anyone the orginal movie deserves better than this chop job 
weird translation as i remember when i watched the original chinese version although it wasnt any big deal but i did like it as i remember but this version is totally destroy that feeling something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap especially some sound effect why don t they put the original track in it i hard can understand if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me it worth my stars with the original trac 
the big sleep here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i couldn t believe what i was watching ! moreover i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating what is going on is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema s most tedious and overratedsleep inducing actor ralph fiennes how i long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do entertain sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as the constant gardener it appears that we unfortunate real film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
will carrie wind up with zhivago or stalin oops i must be mixing up my stories an insufferable view of life among a claque of ruskie girlfriends from the late s to the late s nothing more than sex the city transplanted to moscow in the khruschev and brezhnev eras if thats your cup of borscht more power to you 
for the cover not the film i watched both seven brides for seven brothers and its documentary making of and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers particulary the incredible tommy rall looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film i came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb i decided to purchase the film then i noticed the cover i thought is this what i think it is and clicked on see larger image yikes ! it is i have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational to say the least after just having placed hands are not for hitting on my wish list if warner bros decides to change the illustration on the cover then i ll consider buying it until then for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see i suggest you view the see larger image of the cover before you decide to buy 
waste of money dont purchase episode of season it s minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download 
what shark i watched this movie seeing that it was a shark movie but where s the shark the plot is these people are hostages the shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie but i was watching going okay they re in the water where is the shark even jaws which sucked has more sharks if you like hoatage movies see this on second thought don t but if you like sharks see something else 
poor quality i m not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot it s redundant and unnecessary and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that s based on and well my gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it s original format onto dvd was bad the soundtrack is about to second off from the video part of film therefore the voices don t sync up with the lip movement 
it was entertaining but had one of the worst endings ever what happened anyway my husband and i had to rewind the movie xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts for example the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn t see the woman who was clearly standing up looking around and her baby was crying miserably the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet she wasn t interested at all in comforting the child instead she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved which didn t make any sort of sense these types of questions cheat the viewers because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end its like ordering a piece of cake and not being allowed to eat it which sucks ! ohh by the way four out of the six actors should find new careers 
the last great fad of the th century the crass commercialism of pokemon is hardly the issue here we ve lived through he man thundercats transformers teenage mutant ninja turtles and the mighty morphin power rangers with no real scar left on children s entertainment pokemon enslaved children in the late nineties because it was a genuinely unique and novel idea the video game was addictive the character designs were interesting and the marketing gimmicks of seeing new characters were enticing so what s the problem with pokemon look at the industry when the previous fads hit the airwaves children s entertainment was all about milking toys and movies so much that each fad could survive only until the next hit movie or new toy was released pokemon wasn t like these previous crazes made to sell a bunch of toys until interest moves onto the next big thing pokemon was an institution they created an entire world of escapism that ended up to be so powerful not even the release of a film was able to effect its popularity if you completed the video game they hooked you onto the card game and when interest on the card game waned they released a sequel to the video game which lead to a new set of cards they had us working on a loop that would make george lucas drool by the time the older fans grew up and caught on it was too late the whole industry had taken pokemon s lead and japan animestyle saturated the market digimon card captors loonatics unleashed winx club and yu gioh are all the obnoxious off spring to pokemon that have ruined the fun associated with a craze and have left the soulless commercialism as i said pokemon was a cool idea that just happened to inadvertently cause one of the biggest slumps in children s entertainment that ll take years to get out of as for the film it s just bad 
parents think twice the only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the natalie holloway case about the girl last summer that went on that school trip went off with a boy and disappeared in this movie hilary duff s character is on a school trip to rome meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around rome i felt so bad that disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of natalie holloway in this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded and they didn t even show that part young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie hopefully they will be brough up by good parents that will teach them right to know better than to go off with a stranger in a strange place 
good basis this film is an integral one in the study of film adaptation of jane austen s most popular novel pride and prejudice it represents the beginning of a serious love affair between film and austen novels however it is not great in terms of adaptation if you love pride and prejudice and have never seen this film skip it it will only anger you if you re studying film adaptation of austen novels you must see this one as it has influenced everything that came afterwards and its laurence olivier afterall 
old and out dated this tape was a total waste of time everything about this tape is out dated the year is currently not i was bored and my month old daughter was bored and not interested please do not waste your money or time buying this product if i could give this product a zero star i would 
plot holes the first half hour of this minute movie is actually quite good in fact it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don t know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates she was however but we the audience don t know that however the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam is unexplained especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin however it turns out she isn t so that s why the movie lasts longer than minutes fortunately we re not dealing with unwanted pregnancies either so this doesn t turn into a soap opera however we do have the dreamboat hero who dreams up the rumor about her being raped and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that s true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film dreamboat takes the turn as lead character and it s his story we re following whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film and basically it s her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out dreamboat and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out and everyone else in a way the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth though the characters don t have the same truth in mind it s about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it s not the comic book variety isn t fun for an audience it s just distasteful in other words the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first half hour and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved it might be worth viewing if only once but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that s the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip or in this case deliberate lies is that what goes around comes around and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first min then quit midway but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once just to be sure where this is headed 
not totally faithful to the book first of all i love the chistmas box the book i have read it and re read it i also liked the other books in the series but i was dissapointed with this movie i am not saying that its a bad movie but i think that it took most of what was special and magical and left it out and also the book didn t take place in the s it took place in the s the acting was average nothing else the only one to live up to the charater in the book was ms o toole as keri i hope they someday make a more faithful movie also they changed little things that they had no reason to change richard owned a formal wear co not a ski company and they didn t move from seattle

original is better if you want uncut original version always look for original licensed production not us release its a foreign film it should not be us version to begin with hello why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie s fighting scenes and us release ruins the speed and sound as well i have been collecting jackie chan s movies both hk and us release version for quite some time now i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable and higher in quality american market always like to americanize and control regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way entire world enjoys it no one makes hollywood american movies to french version or chinese version this what americans are doing well enjoy the cheap american version then lo 
compared to the nature of narrative you saw nothing in hiroshima nothing is what he said hiroshima mon amour depicts the reality of the bombing of hiroshima which took place on august the story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing when i watched this movie for the first time i realized this movie was far from a fairy tale instead this movie captured reality and could be described as the fiction aspect of history william gass explains in the nature of narrative throughout the entire movie the main character a woman from france explains the hardships she went through back at home it was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a german soldier i felt it violated a person s right as to whom he she may date it was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of hiroshima the fact that this movie was made in the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles lastly the one thing i must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in french i couldn t help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story it seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax i didn t like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they re really talking about if a person who was completely oblivious about the history of hiroshima were to watch this movie he she that s watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
direct to video potboiler re tread that never should have been made this direct to video sequel is actually more of a re tread of the original guilty pleasure erotic thriller film noir potboiler and another of the countless and pointless direct to video sequels to come from sony comlumbiatristar as of late cruel intentions starship troopers shall i go on wild things focuses around a rich girl susan ward whose stepfather mysteriously dies and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival son of the beach s hot leila arcieri who claims to be the man s true biological daughter naturally just like in the original there are plot twists aplenty as learned by an insurance investigator isiah washington giving a somewhat inspired performance and naturally there are double crosses murders and a redux of the first film s threesome only it s not as erotic as the original s wild things isn t just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it s good points it s a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate is it worth seeing depends how much you liked the first wild things but for the rest of us just watch the original and forget this ever happened 
disappointed i bought the dvd based on all the positive reviews and i think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a star movie my husband and i who love old movies hated it my teenagers just found it completely uninteresting it was apparently made about the time alaska became a state although it deals with an earlier time period and the movie has not aged well the story was uninteresting the direction was uneven the comedy mostly bar fights felt forced and awkward stewart granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there fabian s acting was unmemorable and we felt capucine was miscast we got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like alaska it was obviously shot in southern california i gave it two stars because i was able to sit through the entire thing but i spent most of it asking myself why why am i wasting my time like this 
taboo porn this movie has nothing to do with a house its really just a low budget rape porn i tossed it in the trash about minutes into it 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
waggy mcwaggster man ! this movie is soooooo boring i literally slept through this movie if i die not having watched it again ill be happy i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like yrs old but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr 
so awful i turned it off i saw this film on tv several years ago and started watching it because william hurt is one of my favorite actors i got as far as the monkey man scene and turned it off it was so ridiculous and just plain bad i can probably count on one hand the number of movies i have not watched all the way through i even suffer through the bad and boring ones i couldn t take another minute of this one however 
all american boy strikes out this is one of many serials i saw at the uptown theater in dover nh and one of the few i clearly remember jack armstrong was one of my favorite radio serials for years and i was thrilled when it was announced as the next movie serial at the uptown all i actually remember is the first chapter with that special car which i thought was extremely cool at the time the previews made us think the car was part of the story but after the first chapter it never appears again the rest of the story is disappointing it has a weak script and poor production values the fights are not well choreographed the chapter endings are mediocre there s a little too much sci fi nonsense to make this serial really enjoyable for example in a late chapter they re going to communicate with supersonic sound that would be sound that s faster than sound excuse me dr grood s rocket ship looks suspiciously like the one in atom man vs superman and some of the weapons are more than faintly reminiscent of luthor s in that same serial three of the bad guys resemble the three stooges john hart looked like a movie star but he wasn t much of an actor he played the lone ranger on tv from to replacing clayton moore for a year after which moore was brought back by popular demand rosemary laplanche was miss america of and she toured extensively during the war selling war bonds she could have been used to better advantage here as could claire james as princess alura in fact miss james looks every bit as much miss america like as rosemary does pierre watkin makes a fine uncle jim albeit without the hair he sported as perry white in superman he may be the best actor in the film joe brown jr sure isn the can t deliver one line convincingly as billy he s a pain in the arse as anactor he s a complete disaster columbia got really weird with the release of this film charles middleton as big a name as ever appeared in serials and who plays dr grood was not even listed in the credits middleton passed away only two years after this serial was made and he s looking a little worn out here 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
poor quality the sound is bad i have tried this dvd on different players and it made no difference 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
bias media on media bias starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing anti corperate rant the problem with the media is bias the problem with this film is the same bias 
unbelievable i hated this movie it was unrealistic and unbelievable also julia roberts is a horrible actress and more than slightly resembles an opossum 
lost souls the rules of attraction lost soulsamos lassen and cinema pridethe rules of attraction is a twisted story about sex drugs and college life three students at camden college are involved in a love triangle sean bateman a womanizing drug dealer is love with lauren a virgin but who is more infatuated with her ex boyfriend then there is paul who is bisexual and used to date lauren before he came out paul however is interested in sean who he thinks is bisexual throw in a bunch of other characters and you have a mess in fact everyone in this money is suffering from some kind of problem and each is only looking out for him or herself we can tell right away that no good can come from these people and we are told so right in the beginning as the first scene of the movie is the end of the story and the rest of the movie tells us how we got to that point in fact a more apt name for this movie would be les miserables as that is what everyone turns out to be in reality the film is a satire of those crazy teen movies like american pie and theres something about mary if we look at the movie like this it is ingenious if on the other hand we look at it as just a movie it bombs the characters are not the kind of people that you would want to call friends but that does not mean they are not interesting the problem with them is that we all know someone like them and they are realistic without the acting this film does not move and the cast manages to succeed at that for a young cast the acting is good better than what i had expected his direction however is highly stylized and the tricks that roger avary employs just do not always work but by and large when i consider what he had to work with his job is admirable i think a lot of people were expecting a fluff movie with a young cast and what they got is a dark and realistic movie it destroys some of the myths about drugs and college life and because of this the movie has been deemed offensive by many the treason for the offense is that many cannot understand that there are really this shallow who have no feeling there seems to be no narrative focus no beginning and no end and the focus is on a group of selfish ambiguous characters who traffic in rape drugs and homosexuality and general obsessions we don t see smiling happy college kids rather we are given kids who have problems and they aren t pretty problems either the characters are lost souls pathetic people that we do not want to emulate there is no resolution there is no love everything seems to be overdone and excessive the first time i watched the film i thought that my distrust in humanity had been validated and that perhaps i should consider becoming a loner the characters are vile and horrible and not much more than amalgams of the worst that society has to offer the only character that elicits sympathy dies right way the satire on wasted youth never quite reaches its conclusion and comes off more as sour grapes on the other hand the movie can be classified as brilliant it was true to the novel from which it was adapted and resented real characters even if we d not want to admit that people like this really exist we are not supposed to like these people because they are too much into not being attached to anyone or to themselves on first viewing i found the whole movie to be an appalling mess on second viewing i eased up a bit and by the third viewing i was really into it but then if it takes three viewings to appreciate a movie i wonder if it is worth the effort it is a challenging film when sex means no more than a handshake you want to question our value system likewise i am still questioning the rules of attraction maybe one day i will shout its praises right now i am not in the mood for a fourth viewing 
amateurish they were making sophisticated quality films by this isn t one of them 
hitler making speeches in a cave when this movie began i was sure i was in for something penetrating and deep as it went on i felt that the movie was merely clever within a few minutes of that i was just plain bored the premise hitler his colleagues and a few random nazis in a surreal underground world akin to hell has potential but the movie becomes tedious for lack of any plot or of any pretense of one the whole movie is given over to listening to hitler make speeches about heroism propaganda and other abstract concepts for the sake of variety his speechifying is occasionally interrupted by comments from goebbels goering eva braun and others having hitler talk with sigmund freud was evidently intended to be the cleverest stroke of all freud however is portrayed as a bland ordinary tv stereotype of a psychologist the only way we know he s supposed to be freud is the beard and the pince nez 
stupid to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings aren t really too wise he s like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but doesn t really know that much joe pesci s character is pretty annoying that s probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser s character 
my advice watch get shorty instead the problem with this film is i read the book i was disappointed simply because be cool is an obvious showcase for the musical talent the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would ve been more intersing if somebody would ve said hey don t forget the book but being true to the original source is not hollywood s strong suit be cool provides some popular music some known faces but without john travolta the movie would never have been made a few laughs are provided a couple ironic scenes show up but there s too little to sustain a full length feature basically the project is a disservice to everyone involved some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a clich the rock does the best he can but again hes a gay bodyguard he s the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji his boss vince vaughn who in the book is far more sinister but in the film he s an idiot of course chili is chili travolta does a very nice job and chili s obviously the smartest guy in the room uma thruman s performance is well not funny not serious not intense not much at best she made me shrug i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr but there s just not enough and all the negatives reflect completely on the director enough said there my advice watch get shorty again or read be cool 
disappointed i bought the dvd hoping to see one skit the funniest one my family had ever seen on snl we had it recorded on vhs many many years ago and somehow lost it but we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits smiling laughing joking around man man who reminds me of my doggie hair head i thought for sure that the funniest skit in all of snl history would be on there but no it was just a second clip i was so disappointed ! and it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety they just weren t funny on a positive note there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the dvd that was so sweet it brought me to tears and the bonus featuring phil s audition was quite interesting but overall i don t recommend it 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
vulgar and disgusting saw this one on television vincent van gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy the artist who portrays him does his job very well the scenery is breathtaking however the nudity in the film is vulgar the chaeracters are hard to identify with some of the scenes are disgusting not going to see this one again 
buy the other version the tai seng release i would like to give this version stars i love the movie but this is the dimension release which only offers an english language dub if that s ok by you then this is the cheaper version but if you are a purist like me you ll want the cantonese mandarin version with english subtitles 
we all hated this film i bought this dvd because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen we re still friends but i ll never listen to one of his reviews again our taste must not be compatible my wife daughter and i seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we ve ever seen it s the only movie i ve ever turned off before the end on the plus side watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema i used to think i knew bad movies now i know that most movies are at least pretty good and it s only a very few that are truly bad this is one of those very few bad films best in show belongs to a genre of comedies that i find boring at best but often cruel and mean other films of this type are waiting for guffman bottle rocket etc if you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you ll appreciate this movie 
looks like a routine television program i am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent as for me i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay the fault in order of importance poor screenplay poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino who seems to be vying for the most over thetop performance the film was absurd in many ways from the outset the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans close up after close up conveying no meaning pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his not sofamous european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops first example they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that then instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling police you re under arrest they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source of course pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog stumbling around further pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from we must assume his quarry did the screen writer forget that pacino s colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit too inevitably and apparently not because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him as i watched this scene unfold i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already that pacino has fired on and killed his partner it was then that i decided that i had had enough by the way the european version with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior don t waste your money or on line rental queue on this hollywood drivel ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time the recruit which i could only stand for about a half hour too 
they stole my money i never received this product and the order tracker never displayed the problem with this order icon they stole my and now have the nerve to ask me about the product its bad enough i am stuck in iraq now i have my money stolen they are thieves even if i had to return it i still may have received a refund do not buy from this seller i could never report it and now i am out do not purchase from this seller 
disappointing in more ways than as a remake it s not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick clean near perfect minimalist thriller it s not that much of the added material particularly the internal affairs sub plot feels tacked on and unnecessary it s not even that pacino s character is a toned down shell of the dangerously off kilter detective of the original that one of the more complicated characters frya selmer tanya francke has been reduced down to set dressing or that the ending ruins the film s moral atmosphere it s the fact that nolan a sublimely talented director is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads pacino does the method acting bit again taking it over the top in every single scene hilary swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down toearth hometown girl and robin williams well he s robin williams the kids in this film katharine isabelle and jonathan jackson turn in fine performances that while hardly career makers which they couldn t be considering how far their roles have been pared down are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries mugging see the film for their far tooshort performances but make sure you rent it and don t pay too much to do so 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
forgive me lord i have blasphemized so a bunch of mafia gangsters come over and shoot each other up then they go out west and shoot each other up there including one particular scene in which a bunch of people all get shot up together as part of a sort of montage woo hoo how brilliant i ll never forget this movie not 
the plan of cannibal films if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust the grindhouse release is well worth the money however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful the picture quality is horrendous the movie is lacking any redeemable quality there are a few violent moments but just a few one of the absolute worst italian horror exploitation films made if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films then ferox is the plan 
a waste of time i think this is the same version of animal farm i saw that completely changed the ending of the book this version actually makes a happy ending out of the story ! a complete waste of time and ruined the uncomprimising messages of the book read the book 
notorious euro trash umberto lenzi s most notorious entry into the italian cannibal subgenre is a contender with cannibal holocaust with the most bloodshed whereas cannibal holocaust was a well made exploitation film ferox is just a standard euro trash film laden with shocking gore moments a student travels into the deep amazon with a group of friends to prove here thesis that cannibalism never existed they of course find evidence to prove this wrong our characters meet up with two criminals tied in with a poorly explained subplot that takes place in new york city who guilty by association get the entire group into sickening torture situations by a vengeful cannibal tribe as usual in poor taste there are some real animal killings most of the music was taken from umerto lenzi s previous cannibal film eaten alive ! 
terribly made i have no idea why i saw this movie in the first place perhaps it was because the jungle book is a fascinating story however i was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly in a stupid way the action scenes were terrible i recommend this movie to year olds who dont care about the quality of movies 
don t waste your money on this one talentless people and garbage music torture you in this turkey in no time flat youll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming make it stop out into the yard do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense 
missing episodes this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd what sense does this make what a disappointment this service is 
didn t emanuelle used to involve mostly eroticism if you want erotica then this isn t the emanuelle film for you yes there are a couple of so so love scenes but the one lesbian scene is pratically non existent and the obvious focus of this one is the blood and gore content i expected more erotic content and instead got mostly gruesome scenes that i didn t particularly expect remember that scene in quottarzan the ape man quot where a nude bo derek was tied up and bathed by native women that scene was erotic nothing like that one this video 
edited version this version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the dvd and listed in the imdb i saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie the dvd packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by amazon they made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done i do not recommend this version to anyone the orginal movie deserves better than this chop job 
i have only six words for this pitiful woeful remake of a classic frankenheimer flick and what are those words why simply put they are denzel washington is no frank sinatra any questions no i didn t think s 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
great acting but a bad story line mario van peebles patsy kensit and paula marshall are all talented individuals whose talent went to waste in this film the storyline of crime busting werewolves was really dumb the main werewolf itself looked like a joke in comparison to the werewolf in quotan american werewolf in london quot 
wild orchid please more like withered orchid after two moon junction and weeks i expected a lot when i watched wild orchid last night unfortunately i was extremely disappointed i don t mean to imply the movie is totally awful or the worst movie ever made it s not but the movie had nothing unique about it at all and lacked a certain something the expression when you got it you got it holds true to movies and wild orchid didn t have it its not mickey rourke or carre otis fault their both attractive people who seemed to try hard with the material on hand but the material just wasn t interesting it lacked subtlety the worst part of the film is the horrid trite dialogue im afraid if i touch you you ll disappear if you want me come and hold me right now you ve got to be kidding me zalman king should learn to quit while he s ahead take a look at the red shoe diaries for example the same story recycled multiple times shamelessly using david duchovney to draw viewers because it wouldn t attract a single one without him or at least none out of high school and not desperately looking for some late night nudity this film is the same it uses weeks and mickey rourke to draw viewers even though it can t stand on its own feet because it s so unoriginal and poorly written never mind the acting what was bruce greenwood thinking wild orchid held neither the fascinating complexities and characters of weeks or the dreamlike imagery and compelling mystery of two moon junction it was just sex it held none of the sensuality of the above mentioned it s too bad because there was a lot of potential there it was very much a letdown in this case what you see is ultimately exactly what you ll get just don t expect anything more then that again i wish this movie had been made differently the main word that comes to mind when viewing wild orchid is typical 
this is horrible i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i ve been trying for the past days and darn it all it s not working it s not as if i m downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn t go through i think it s better to just buy the dvds i think it s absolutely horrible to tease customers like that 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
the firm great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
movie great dvd substandard the sound on this dvd is absolutely horrible the dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering i also have the vhs on which the sound is perfect so i can still watch this wonderful movie but i would sure like to get my money back for the dvd 
old documentary please think this dvd is recorded in more worse this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of quotcompanyquot same worst sound quality documentary i suspect the word quotconcertquot or quotsoundtrackquot in dvd title 
a respectable entry but this franchise needs a creative transfusion i might as well re draft this review as only of people enjoyed the first draft that s wouldn t normally phase me but i can do better for you in this case i first saw a segment of st on cable and mistook it for an anemically budgeted direct todvd release this ticked me off a bit because i m a fan of phil tippett who got his major feature film directorial shot on this movie having now got the dvd i have unreeled it from the beginning and i find it loads more ambitious intelligent and well rendered by director tippett than i had given the producers credit for permitting tippett has been an innovator in the cgi field stop motion go motion and transitional model tocgi models manipulated so as to provide dynamic effects for an impressive array of digital creatures among those milestones are the perfectly convincing insect creatures in the first starship troopers movie the multitudes of individually rendered creatures in starship troopers are spotlessly realistic as a general rule if a studio greenlights a movie sequel as a direct todvd release they intend to suffocate the production whether the franchise has been good bad or mediocre in the market by simply failing to provide a generous or even a minimal budget to sustain life support in any recognizable way trust me starve any sequel of support and money and you become a key factor in ruining even the best of franchises starship troopers the first was not a runaway commercial hit on first run apparently when compared to its million cost but sci fi buffs are a loyal film audience with eternal memories and it is certain that this ambitious sci fi production will continue to attract countless repeated viewings and income for the rest of the studios and the filmmakers natural lives nobody loses on this one a sequel is hardly a big gamble if one invests long termregardless of that director phil tippett has not only done an impressive job of directing his first major film he has also done a very smart job of producing a generous portion of images large in scope and convincing in power within his spare budget looking at the bug war scenes in the first act you might easily not suspect there were any production restrictions at all credit mr tippett for that achievement in fact there are moments that benefit from lessons learned in the first movie which have added impact as a result now for a few notes i would have liked to see the bug culture and biology expanded in new logical ways i would like to have seen bug life cycle mechanics which did not rehash ground covered by other unrelated movies what has been done and re done in sci fi productions as far back as alien the creative possibilities for an intelligent multiped exoskeleton hive bred civilization are unlimited there is no need at all for the writers or fx techs to resort to the over used and tired gimmick of an alien climbing from one human s mouth to another human mouth for example nor do we need yet another script in which we revisit the old familiar premise of films from invasion of the body snatchers to the hidden to the thing that anyone can be inhabited by an alien and still appear normal it has been done to death let s move on and discard that whole much copied process i could tell you things about the way a crawdad captures and eats a minnow from the tail forward that would make your hair stand on end there is plenty of fresh untapped bug behavior to mine and there is far too much writing talent involved with the starship troopers series to need to use anything rehashed from any previous motion picture still in all phil tippett s feature debut as director is more than competent and particularly surprising for his facility with the actors i look forward to his future development as a director 
horrible i went to see this movie when it first came out and i nearly fell asleep watching it this movie is not worth watching it s so fake it s easy to tell whats going to happen next 
not for normal people i thought my and year old sons could learn a few things about table manners by watching this video it turns out that this video is only about eating in extremely formal situations it tells which of your forks to use first and how sorbet is used to cleanse your pallet between courses good if you are eating with the president not good for the average family who would like to improve kids manners 
dont get fiji final week dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a minute recap going to the finale i didnt even get a full minute episode no finale i got rippped off dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show 
weak script poor performance well nice cinematography as set designer work nicely interiors and well dressed actors maybe visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year as other reviewers trying to assure 
terrible i have never not been able to sit through a rated g movie however my sister and i rented this thinking it would be a funny show and it was so terribly boring that i was forced to leave the room i couldn t believe it because i love movies i can see how this movie would be funny for a year old boy to watch but don t count on the parents or older siblings being able to sit through it 
its official brad pitt cannot act ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a cult classic isnt that what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch or underated theres a reason it was underated it sucks brad pitts performance was laughable watch any episode of gunsmoke and tell me early gracewasnt a bad impersonation of festus from start to finish and that guy from the x files david sumthin or other mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film this guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand and juliet lewis playing a yet another brain dead bimbo who woulda saw that one coming the only reason i gave this one stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat i think its called morbid fascination like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident it repulses you but you just cant turn away if you want my advice and you probably dont take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a gunsmoke dvd that way you get festus and you get to watch matt dillon beat the h outta somebody 
britney yes this dvd no no no ! save your money this dvd was made after baby one more time exploded onto the scene it contains no performances or music by britney and only has a few pictures of her it s just a bunch of interviews with people from her hometown in louisianna all of which have hair straight out of the s and don t work well in front of cameras it s been recorded on a home video camcorder obviously my advice is to skip this save your money it s a snoozefest even if you area huge britney fan you ll end up regretting buying this 
not worth i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for bucks and i am so glad that i did that said the first series is worth watching for two main reasons overt lesbianism and jinnai the former is self explanatory while the latter jinnai is without a doubt the best character in the series despite the fact that he is the antagonist you can t say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed out character as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story s main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging and this is what makes the second series all four dismal episodes so tragic they nerfed jinnai he could never have been called a genius in the first series but he was decidedly intelligent cool pragmatic supremely self confident and an effective leader even though he was also manic and delusional in el hazard ii as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain they have turned jinnai into a slapstick idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon i suggest purchasing el hazard through alternate means watching the first series and discarding the second let s face it even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
bow wow i can t understand the good reviews given by others to this movie frankly i thought it was a dog not to say that it had no redeeming features the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing if improbable and the girl herself was a real sweetie and a good actress perfect for the part in fact the acting all around was admirable but the script ! yikes ! not a single character in the whole movie with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists had any motivation for anything they did people acting awkward or mean in fact just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean or spiteful or stupid for no reason at all it seems as though somehow the movie could have been good but didn t make it call it almost watchable i came away from lawn dogs yawn dogs feeling not at all enriched puzzled perhaps at why anyone would make such a movie well there was that admirable unlikely friendship but that was all pass this one by 
so many gaps in the story this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he s suffered in cuba and that s about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what s going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it s trying to convey it s lost in the plotless story 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
lowenstinks this film was dreadful streisand is absolutely unlikeable to enjoy this film you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just can t see how that is possible i couldn t believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was along with the english patient this is one of the worst critically acclaimed films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing 
stars stu pid this is stupid and broing the ending is soooo set up for megalodon eeeeeeeeeehhhh don t really remember it but i know it was stupid say no more 
never again i never received this product and will not order from you again when there is a problem you are not easy to reach 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
horrid i once saw this movie seven years ago and really liked it hey i was young and naive i recently rented this movie to see it again i was once again robbed of my money cameron s closet is minutes of pure boredom the acting is horrible the monster is laughable the writing is unbelieveable i could just go on and on about how terrible this movie is cameron is a young boy who has telekinetic powers he then brings a demon to life through a statue his dad gave him then people begin to die a detective and a psychiatrist begin to investigate i can t begin to comprend why i liked this movie the first time i saw it this is just one big laughfest from the start to the end 
not worth the street fight this movie does not even lead up to the game the plot isn t good atall terrible acting performances by most of the actors actresses iwas surprise to know that kylie mingoue was cammy the fight sceneswere fake my favorites in the game were ken and ryu and they madethem unreal and for the rest of the other fighters their backgroundstories are also fake and very hard to believe basically the wholemovie from start to end was very boring in my own opinion theyshould make a remake of street fighter save ur money ! 
funny premise unfunny film i was very disappointed with this film the premise was really intriguing with elvis switching places with an elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at graceland leaving the real elvis to scratch out a living as what else an elvis impersonator and now at the end of the king s life he s a semi invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy since it s texas the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to stevie ray vaughn and oh yeah jfk is also in this nursing home having inexplicably been transformed into ozzie davis how can you miss with a setup like this well for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there s no real need to provide any additional comedy the movie is flat with very little humor as other reviewers have noted it moves at a glacial pace even allowing for the protagonists being somethings who don t move like they used to sure the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film but there s no point in making a comdey that isn t funny nice try but booooooooooring not at all recommended 
stars alright so i had intended to see this movie upon its release way back and just really never got to it a week or so ago it was playing on oprah s oxygen network and i was very happy that i would finally be able to see it overall it was alright so then it was on again the next day and i couldn t stomach watching it again it may be called brown sugar but the plot moves slower than molasses it is way too predictable and sweet with very little substance it wasn t even all too interseting the first time around and i couldn t stand seeing it a second time there s a reason why these movies are on tv people no need to purchase the dvd as soon as i saw it once i had gotten my dose and wanted no more 
weird translation as i remember when i watched the original chinese version although it wasnt any big deal but i did like it as i remember but this version is totally destroy that feeling something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap especially some sound effect why don t they put the original track in it i hard can understand if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me it worth my stars with the original trac 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
the worst movie ever made this movie has got to be the worst i have ever seen garfield written by jim davis is a wonderful comic with lots of clever humor garfield is my favorite comic of all time but this movie was nothing like the comic at all even jaws the revenge and batman and robin can entertain me when i m really bored this movie i felt like i was trapped threw the whole thing before this movie i believed that every movie could be slightly entertaining nd then i saw this if you re a fan of the comicdon t see this movie its not garfield its just a bunch of characters with the same names that don t act at all like there comic counter parts i think if i could rate this movie any number i would rate it its just that bad do not by this movie in fact don t even rent it you aren t missing anything if you don t see it my final word is that if you want to see the real garfield just read the comics 
does not live up to the hype it is not good as a mainstream movie it does not have a good plot some scenes are not relevant even as a soft porn movie it does not do a good job try watching i like to play games its a much better soft porn movie 
say no to dubs even though fans of hk cinema have as a whole come a long way since hk films were generally only seen in the states on saturday afternoon television some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing hk films in their original language with subtitles this film is available from columbia tristar only in a dubbed format and for that reason i won t be getting the region release of this film 
widescreen or hd blueray i have to say i love this movie very well done but after all these years of it s release why has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on hd or blueray or a new disc dvd set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie 
blah blah blah this has got to be the worst film i ve ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i don t have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he s sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i ve seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television notes this film had some great talenta song from olivia newton jon and one of my most personal favorites mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she s to good but why this film she and mila are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this 
depressing and unrealistic the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst josh hartnett kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline this film is directed by sofia coppola lost in translation i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola doesn t mean you belong in the same category as best director of all time sometimes magic does not stirke twice how can all five sisters end up killing themselves their homelife wasn t that unbearable a lot of parents are religious but that doesn t mean you ll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide kristen dunst just gets on my nerves her acting is the same in every film don t believe the hype the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking poetic film 
the blue fairy gimmie a break this movie was cheeseball beginning to end i thought the concept was corny even before i watched it but decided to give it a try anyway big mistake a robot who can love lame ! and with all this high tech stuff the docs can t bring the couple s real son out of a coma or whatever was wrong with him so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can love but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone brialliant plan especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin the family decides they don t want the robot and the mom loves him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of it was then i knew i was smelling a stinker but nooooo someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth i have since nicknamed it artificial idiocy the worst part was the end ugh i don t even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what i mean the whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism for those of you who have not seen it i suggest renting it before you buy it maybe this movie is great for some people it just wasn t my thing 
what about the missing episodes why should one buy this series what about the missing episodes are they going to be added later or this is it i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel or a keyboard without the c and r keys i d like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do 
lame two problems first problem let s say you re the typical kidnapper rapistkiller for fun and out of postmodern boredom you kidnap two girls off the street in new york city what are the odds that your randomly chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives or miles away one in ten million twenty million second problem the movie even with a run time of an otherwise short minutes doesn t have enough action or development to fill the void in short it s boring and in several scenes where craven seems more interested in the bucolic wechester county scenery than moving the plot along i found myself reaching for the fast forward 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
this version is as exciting as paint drying when this film version of much ado about nothing came out there was a great deal of critical acclaim for it i disagree with all of this acclaim kenneth branagh s production has taken a lively shakespearean comedy and turned it into a bloviated not veryfunny movie shakespeare comedies should be done fast and with a certain silly madcap fun to them this production is so slow i had trouble staying awake it is so bogged down and so full of its own self importance that it becomes a dead bore this is the worst version of shakespearean comedy i have ever seen either on stage or on tv or in the movies the worst production of any shakespearean play i have seen was a uc berkeley theater department production please compare this movie version of much ado about nothing to the joseph papp s tv version of the same based on his new york shakespeare festival production the latter is fast paced lively and madcap mr papp moved the story to the turn of the century and incorporate additional comic elements by adding keystone cops to his version without cutting lines mr papp s version is done in the true spirit of shakespearean comedy it is delightful it does not have the big stars kenneth branagh and emma thompson but does not suffer from their absence my experience in the past is that any shakespearean production that has to cut out some or many of the bard s lines is one in which the cuts have been made to make room for non shakespearean bloat devised by the director this is not the first time i have disagreed with the general consensus on a production of a shakespearean play not sure if this means i am idiot or that i have higher standards for shakespearean productions than others

pretty lame i rented this movie on vhs because that was teh only formate they had i think its pretty freaking lame the sport sequeces are cool but aside from that it was very boring basicly i think this movie was yet another example of hollywood movie trash 
you are acting like hu man not ro man robot monster is one of those classic five star one star s horror movies the problem with c movies is that they can t be rated by the usual standards by its own standards its a gem but for the fact that this gobbler wasn t touched by ed wood it has all the guaranteed elements of bad moviemaking actually robot monster was panned so severely upon release that director phil tucker attempted suicide afterward robot monster concerns the depredations of a fat gorilla suited space alien in a diving helmet roman from the planet ro man which is populated by the race of ro mans who comes to earth and destroys virtually all of human life with the aid of a vacuum tube radio and a lawrence welk bubble machine roman is a grouchy slow moving space visitor who talks with his hands and grumbles a lot he lives in one of the more familiar hollywood caves of bronson canyon california the few surviving humans a family of five protect themselves by stringing aluminum foil around their house so that ro man cannot use his death ray machine against them instead he must dispose of them one at a time by the process of strang ulaaation if they are so foolish as to step outside of their reynolds wrap safety zone given their current world political situation the humans richard nixon like are seeking peacebut peace with honor from ro man hmmm seems reasonable after all ro man has really shown restraint up until this point why shouldn t they trust him but wait ! even after atomizing everybody else apparently including the film s scriptwriter ro man has developed a penchant for alice the eldest daughter of the survivors fortunately for us alice seems to have a corresponding yen for excessively hirsute and overweight men wearing fishbowls on their heads so while ro man is distracted picking a bouquet for his new girlfriend the family figures out a way to finally finish him off exactly how humanity is going to repopulate the earth with only the father knows best kids around escapes me but clearly someone involved with this film escaped from somewhere its as bad and as much fun as it sounds
