moderately sly premise but precious little to behold here if mind bending thrillers like basic instinct prove anything the theme of an expert becoming obsessed with his cryptic subject presents a great deal of potential this film attempts a similar tapestry our protagonist ewan mcgregor finds himself progressively involved in eavesdropping a disturbing femme fatale across the street ashley judd who s in the blackwidow spider type habit of zapping all males she beds problem is nothing much happens of this premise we never find ourselves feeling for the agent or his liege no romantic overtures with dangerous undertones no edge of the seat interactions ala sharon stone films of the early s instead there s a queer apparition of the agent s daughter that punctuates every second scene and adds to the pile of threads that end up nowhere such constant failure to take advantage of its almost intriguing buildups gets the film my generous star rating anyone but mcgregor s biographer needn t bother 
warning not in a long time have i had such a dislike for a movie as i do with freeway i am a fan of dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out it has reese witherspoon after all how bad could it be well really bad first of all on a good note reese witherspoon is good enough in the movie although her character isn t all that likeable nor do you empathize with her all that much but reese does a good job with what shes given my main beef with the movie is that i would not call it a dark comedy it s more like a comedy that also wants to be dark graphic and serious or a dark graphic serious movie that wants to be funny the result is that it s a movie that doesnt know what it is or what it s trying to do both the funny parts and the serious parts are horribly mixed together in a way that it feels like two different movies fighting for the screen but hey if you find being shot in the neck or stiff lifeless grandmas with their throats slit and a horrified expression on their face to be funny you just might like this movie 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
the usual cardone fare the forsaken j s cardone i should probably know better by now and yet i still subject myself to j s cardone movies in this one sean a guy dawsons creek s kerr smith hired to drive a car from los angeles to miami picks up a hitchhiker nick final destination s brendan fehr in the middle of the desert the two of them encounter megan a sick girl coyote ugly s izabella miko when they stop for the night in town nick insists she come with them saying he knows what s wrong with her and eventually tells sean that the group have vampires on their tail well the word vampires doesn t exactly crop up seriously but come on you know what they are the rest of the movie can be summed up with things blow up cardone is one of the straight toscifichanel directors who fills his movies with young andbeautifuls who have limited if any acting ability but are relatively easy on the eyes in their defense this is not a new tactic witness the brilliant film career of say farrah fawcett smith is a bit above the average y nb in acting ability though the other two here are right on the mark the minor characters don t have much to go on either as the script came straight out of a write your first screenplay in twenty one days kind of book which could make a passable film if you had a really original or even a really good fast paced plot alas no such thing exists here this movie deserves a mercifully quick slide into obscurity about the only was i can imagine it having any longevity at all is if it s somehow turned into a drinking game 
disappointing would love to see a good remake this movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them for a theater lover this is heartbreaking what a disappointing story if a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class a adulterer even the ending was changed and not for the better the dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing a pretty face is not enough 
hahaha well what can i say i m usually not very picky about seamonstermovies especially when there s a shark involved and though it didn t surprise me red water hm whatever you do don t believe the cover of the dvd that shark looks frightening and looks to be a great white the shark in this movie however is a bull shark and very plastic in a non hollywoodsencethere is plenty of shark in red water some reviewers here mean that you hardly see the shark but that s not the problem the problem is that you see the shark too many times and as mentioned it s not much to look at ! the effects are something between jaws and that explains a lot if you are familiar with those the acting is what you d expect from a b movie ok at its best the script is paperthin but it could ve been more watchable if more story less shark i doubt that i will watch red water again b movies like anacondas and lake placid well at least the effects are somewhat believable i didn t expect much but got less 
not much plot poor editing avoid avoid this one the bad reviews are not kidding the plot is almost non existent the action scenes are not enough to make up for the poor editing the writing has drawn the characters very thinly sadly a reason to watch this movie is to be amused at how badly it is put together 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
fair this wasn t as bad as i thought it was going to be the biggest disappointment for me were the main players few of them really looked like the historical persona lincoln s portrayal was a letdown from the start although he looked fairly close his voice was all wrong lincoln had a squeaky voice with a real kentucky twang this comes from observations by lincoln s law partner herndon as well as nicolaye amp haye lincoln s secretaries and biographers hal holbrook actually came closest to the right pitch and tone even more annoying was the portrayal of sec of war edward stanton here he comes across like a frustrated grandfather the real stanton was not a lincoln fan he once refered to lincoln as the quotoriginal baboon quot and constantly challenged the th president on issue after issue lincoln would let stanton have his temper tantrums but managed to quotput his foot down quot at the right time stanton himself was far from well liked by other members of the cabinet and was actually feared and loathed by many first lady mary todd was far too slender and attractive in this depiction if you ve ever seen photos of the real mary she looked dowdy if not downright frumpy her rages were legendary in washington she once chased a deliveryman down the street with a broomstick secretary seward called her a quotshewolfquot and others dubbed her a bit a surprise for me was the portrayal of dr charles a leale the year old army surgeon who took charge of lincoln after the shooting the actor bore more than striking resemblance it was almost spooky to watch jim bishop s book was followed closely which was one of the more appealing parts of this film even snippets of dialog from the book crept in with regularity 
great movie terrible print i have been a big fan of this most fun of all kung fu flicks for more than twenty years from originally seeing it in the theater to having the vhs version to the dvd it s got everything a great kitschy martial arts film should have high kicking fast moving action coupled with colorful costumes and scenery lends all of the excitement any movie needs but of course the masks are what sets this movie apart and gives it its most distinctive flavor even though aside from the scorpion no other character wears his mask for more than the first few minutes of the film the huge downside to this dvd is as others have pointed out the quality of the print it is simply terrible grainy and scratched with multiple blips and splices it is annoying to watch on a medium like dvd which is normally so pristine i took a previous reviewer s advice and found the dvd on the celestial release and i couldn t beleive it the difference is night and day the celestial release has been remastered and restored to the glory that dvd can bring i was so used to watching the grainy release that seeing it like this brought details to my eyes i had forgotten i bought mine from hong kong flicks and it was worth every penny it includes extras like movie stills the original movie poster and a behind the scenes feature this is the dvd to get not this sub par print 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
features one seriously sweaty slasher he knows you re alone isn t exactly an apt title considering most of the kills take place when the victim has at least one other person close by but i guess he knows you re somewhat alone with other people in the general vicinity doesn t have quite the same ring right off the bat we learn the identity of the killer so there is no mystery which is fine if we are looking at a flat out slasher with a high body count but he knows doesn t really come off as a straight slasher flick it feels more like a mystery film the body count is low the special effects are limited meaning very little gore quite a bit of the film is taken up by don scardino and the guy who played the principal in the breakfast club trying to find out when and where the ever sweaty murderer will strike next i would have been more generous in my review if there had been either a higher body count or if we got to see more of the red stuff flow my guess is if this came out in theaters today it would have a pg rating instead of r i thought the acting was pretty good for a b level flick the comic relief ex boyfriendmorgue attendant guy was not annoying like most s slasher comic relief guys and i am sure i am dating myself here but when one of the actresses in the movie puts on these huge headphones and settles down on the floor to jam to some tunes with some refreshments that took me right back to my high school days i remember doing the same thing many times only my head didn t later end up in the fish bowl so for nostaligic reason i had to give this at least stars 
still updated even after all these years i have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because i wanted my kids to see it i was very young when i first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in asia daryl hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid tom was also perfect for the role i can t say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of tom hanks and meg ryan though but it wasn t bad i can t imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie i let my kids watch it finally together with my niece we found ourselves teary eyed in the end it was just so touching we couldn t help it even the theme song sang by rita coolidge was perfect for the ending for those who wanna know the title is love came for me im glad i purchased the anniversary edition i have a home theater and the dolby surround sound was just what i needed it would have been better if dts was used but i m not complaining for those who are thinking of getting this i hope you make the decision to do so tom hanks is a certified great actor this movie will soon be in line with the classics like gone with the wind and breakfast at tiffany s it s already a collector s item you won t regret it ! besides love stories don t get out of style 
not happy i m a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa 
dreary hard to watch given high acclaims this film has collected over time i was glad to pick up a vhs copy at my local library sale began to watch it last night i was able to sit thru the part when the tape ended i was actually glad i felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part ! the movie is dreary to the max people portrayed are irrational lost uncommunicative and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers in some way this movie reminded me of the dreary winter lasting months i spent in russia a couple of years ago to me the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of soviet state for survivors nothing made any sense anymore except perhaps fear and evil as people in this dreary film reflects people have been already destroyed in their souls they are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience maybe that is the real meaning of this movie to really reflect what happened to people s psyche after lenin and stalin s unlimited terror they found a parallel in mongol s devastation and oppression of medieval russia in both cases people were left shattered helpless irrational withdrawn and autistic 
has not aged well q larry cohen i have very fond memories of seeing this as a teen and rented it for the purpose of giving it another look though older eyes unfortunately to say q hasn t aged well is being quite kind quetzalcoatl the title character is a very large bird serpent who s flying around new york eating people who find themselves in high places at least he might be quetzalcoatl an aztec god or he might just be a big mutant no one knows more to the point no one seems to be overly surprised that there is a large flying serpent picking off new yorkers the cops assigned to the case shepard david carradine and powell richard roundtree certainly take things in stride the commissioner malachy mccourt frank s brother is the only one who expresses any sort of normal reaction to the events disbelief while the big bird and the cops are the meat of the story its actual core is jimmy quinn a young michael moriarty a small time crook who s run afoul of some tough characters through no real fault of his own jimmy s odd relationship with the monster could have turned this into a wonderful psychological thriller and there are glimmers of that sort of thing but the script never follows through q has more the feel of a quickie monster flick none of the storylines is explored much beyond the surface the special effects are alarmingly and hysterically low budget and the characters were they to stand still could often substitute for props but hey it s got a big flying lizard that s something 
mild things lame pun for a lame movie what does wild things have going against it from the get goa no denise richards b no name actors c being a crappy direct tovideo sequel d no denise richards naked what is wrong with wild things after the fact aa script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew b one sex scene a weak threesome one of the few things even linking this to the original c sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked leaving us with a body double and naked frombehind shot wait let me play that again if i seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an erotic thriller did i mention no denise richards 
enjoyable at some parts but just plain stupid in others what i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its monty python ! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind if you are new to monty python i would get the quest for the holy grail before this one also the monty python s flying circus is great too it comes in a dvd set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff i really did not enjoy certain parts but there is a few good moments 
boring i used to think this film was okay but it s really lame he s going home only cause he wants a car shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
stars if able this film is a mockery of the aviation field a very small percentage of the phraseology is correct even the plot itself is severely flawed first off being an air traffic controller i know first hand that you can t go and work at some facility you haven t worked at for a while until you get evaluated to make sure you can work safely second of all you can t move from your position sector if you will and start working at another while leaving the previous position unmonitored if you are using this movie to learn about air traffic then please do not apply for a job the movies will not teach you about the job it takes anywhere between years to get rated at an atc center you can t just come in and take a position when a movie comes out that is realistic to air traffic i will put my stamp of approval on it 
sean patrick flannery i love him but so there i was surfing the net listening to suicide kings in the background thinking okay so i just won the young indian jones trading card set what else should i get that has sean patrick flannery in it ! a ha ! here we go a movie with britney murphy as well score ! well i was sadly sadly very disturbed that i paid this much money for a movie that sucked this badly if you like quirky black comedies this movie is for you but not for me ! sean patrick flannery drives around with his wifes skeleton britney murphy causes her fiance to kill himself because she doesn t want to marry him it all just sucked sean though is still of course sexy sexy ! and so is brtney murphy but i think she looks better as a thin blond than a baby fat brunette 
last stand at saber river we never got to see the movie as both copies of this dvd that we ordered had problems and would not play on any dvd player we owned amazon com was very kind in crediting us for both bad copies and even gave us a coupon for a discount on a future purchase for our inconvenience great customer service you might like to know that we found a copy of this movie at a local retailer and it would not work either maybe it s a manufacturing defect thanks for asking it s nice to be able to voice an opinion 
nails on a chalkboard let s face it nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie s viewing audience one way or the other those who love j lo will declare the greathess of this movie in a variety of ways those who hate j lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is and those who love quality film won t waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists guilty pleasure indeed ! one thing you have to admit about j lo she s consistent she sings bad acts bad and is merely eye candy for thoe who find her appealing and this movie is full of all of the above plus awful cliche ridden emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with hollywood writing aspirations since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes at least it s had it s short but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous just like the lead starlett maniupulative only begins to describe this drek but that said it s more than enough time wasted on this movie i merely felt compelled to warn folks don t waste your time it stinks 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
even steve thinks this film sucks after doing this film steve martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it but roxanne la story and bowfinger are some of steve s best works 
if you love the book you ll hate the video this video is a terrible adaptation of a wonderful book all the charcters and their relationships are distorted from the original this is done by the same team that animated quotthe grinch who stole christmas quot which is wonderful but they strayed far afield from the original story line this time this is apparently to accommodate a few forgettable allan sherman tunes which unlike the songs from grinch take away from the story rather than improving it the second video if possible is even worse these s revisionist versions of children s classics should not have been resurrected thumbs down 
a few slices short of a pie this one will be brief the movie is an excuse for young actors to use the f word and demonstrate that cannot act the characters are cheap rip offs of the original which is to say one dimensional american pie presents band camp certainly does not flesh them out one final note eugene levy how much cash had to be thrown at your to take this one on 
a tale in two minds the border in this film which is beyond belief is that of credibilty the drama s tone is disturbingly melodramatic with the relief doctor s appearance at a high society fund raising ball in london we can accept this though given the painful urgency of his message but when jolie quits her poor husband to ethiopia in pursuit of responding to well intended empathy for the war and famine stricken camps the balance of the film gets crazily out of whack and never recovers it s not to say that romantic love has no place in such dire life circumstances more the film makes this point above the far more expressive needs of the people who the aid workers are there to service quite addled really and undrermining all other high minded and serious utterances made by the lead actors in ethiopa in particular this seemed in errant taste the conceptual work is at the root of this 
becomes old very fast the first five minutes of the dvd was interesting however after that i found that i was forcing myself to watch it without a great deal of enjoyment 
big brash and boring the movie extreme ops which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it it is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips this movie has no plot and no characterization the point appears to be to display some amazing stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station the plot and i use the term loosely concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film they have been hired by a japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche the reason why is never really given so this ragtag group heads for austria why they made the decision to film the shot in the alps instead of the perfectly good rocky mountains is similarly never explained except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers he like the theater audience seems to find them just as annoying as we do but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or even more sensibly walking out in the middle of the movie he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them i usually try to find some good points in a movie i review so it is somewhat balanced however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say i guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty does that count do yourself a favor and give this a miss i would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on dvd shelves there is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull dumb movie 
wonderful program but flawed files okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me 
avoid if you like vampire movies and if you want to see good acting there are very few movies that i haven t finished watching this now goes on the short list luckily i didn t rent this one and instead was excited to see it on tivo that is until after minutes in i was hoping a vampire would kill me this film while it has an r rating and there is a reason why even the toned down tv version was extremely graphic from pulling out someone s tongue watching a vampires head blow up and catch fire in the sun to blood spray there isn t anything wrong with a good horror movie but graphic violence to fill time so you don t have to have actors say anything seems a bit of a waste the premise of a rag tag bunch of vampire hunters joining forces to defeat evil could have been a great movie but the low budget director chosen and filming of this movie won t make it a classic on anyone s list in addition the movie was way overacted i don t know if everyone was trying to make the film better or what but the overacting made it to the point that it made the acting look horrible it got to the point i no longer cared who won a battle as i said this is one of less than a dozen movies i have been looking forward to seeing that i couldn t even finish gets star cause i can t give it less

power i can t rate it because i received discs from amazon and bth of them jammed on me i would luv to see this movie beware if your considering ordering it 
pointless film when you decide to adapt a classic film you should take warning several aspects has the story aged how has the suspense s concept altered for the new audiences we know about the professed sympathy of cimino for rourke we saw him in the year of the dragon and somehow mickey doesn t look credible as the distorted mind criminal he is too rational and cold to represent that hard character the illumination is another serious problem the whole drama looks extremely theatrical anthony hopkins looks uncomfortable with the role and mimi rogers is inexpressive elias koteas is simply out of context and perhaps that s why the insipid dialogue maybe david morse shows certain wild tendency there is a rigidity in the dialogue obviously you assist to the common places the internal disagreements in the policy procedure lindsay cruise is assertive in this role but the initial sequence of the getaway is terrific it looks too artificial and the viewer adrenaline simply is not emanated the sumptuous photography saves the film of the collapse the music didn t help to maintain the suspense it is not easy to readapt a classic film of the fifties something similar happened with cape fear s remake the question might be around the new approach of the suspense and the new technologies bogart looked extremely old for the role and rourke looked too elegant to be a convincing ex con good entertainment for teenagers in a pop corn rainy weekend 
buyer beware not what s advertised don t know why my first note hasn t appeared so i ll briefly restate the claim tofame of this film is it s avant garde push theenvelope sexuality amazon describes this film as unrated but that s not what nearly all of these listings are selling these are the new r rated version that is massively redacted in fact all of what makes this film famous has been reduced to some brief nudity even though the box continues to bill it as the sexiest movie ever made on top of that despite an english only cover my vhs purchase was subtitled in spanish the seller has offered an adjustment he didn t know but amazon needs to drop the unrated description as that implies the original those still interested might look for something like a directors cut i still haven t found one sorry if this is a duplicate of previous post 
hahahhahahah hahahahahha boy what a retarded movie ! this is the stupidest thing ever whats that music everytime it go s in sync with what the actors are doing it s so emberessingly bad i cant believe anyone would take it seriously see the second one if you must melinda clarke is hotter than shirlyn finn 
i would go lower than i one if it were possible this may easily be one of the dumber movies made in the last hundred years and there were a lot of them this definitely ranks up in the tile 
for die hard kutcher fans only the movie starts off very slowly with childhood episodes from ashton kutcher s character it s at least an hour before we see the adult kutcher although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene the premise is good and it has some good momentum in the middle which is why i gave it two stars the shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done but the overall story line is very weak and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story also the movie has too many tongue incheek references to kutcher s real life circumstances such as the reference to tightywhities they distract from the story and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle which is too bad if you are not a kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie skip this one 
riverdance makes me wanna drown in a river i remember this being a big deal to many a housebound old geezer a few years back after being forced to watch it by a former friend of mine who hadn t quite reached housebound old geezer status but was approaching it i gradually realized the real reason most of my ancestors hopped the boat from ireland to the shining shores of the united states that whole potato famine thing was just a cover story i also see this presentation as a reinforcement of the stereotype about irish folks bein alcoholics cuz i was hankerin for a few nips of my fave hard lemonade about halfway into the show to help dull the pain that arose from the sheer boredom i was experiencing i won t even go into my inexplicable hankering for lucky charms cereal now don t get me wrong i m aware that michael flatley and his troupe likely put in endless hours of practice and conditioning in order to do all of the dance numbers just right and all that nonsense i just don t dig the kinda dances they do they re neither exciting nor entertaining to me it also didn t help that when riverdance toured the area i lived in flatley got po d by the local big venue s promoters for some reason and proclaimed he d never bring any of his shows to my neck of the woods ever again needless to say when i heard this bit o news i said to myself thank god lat 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
terribly made i have no idea why i saw this movie in the first place perhaps it was because the jungle book is a fascinating story however i was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly in a stupid way the action scenes were terrible i recommend this movie to year olds who dont care about the quality of movies 
bad movie do not do not purchase this movie i just finished seeing it for the first time recently and i can say hands down that this was far and away the worst movie that steven seagal has ever made although i am not a prude the language was disgusting with mother f this and mother f that every seconds the plot went nowhere and it was filled with unnecessary violence most of his old movies went somewhere but this one was one violence bad language filled scene after scene after scene if you liked the old steven seagal movies you won t like this one 
didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
can i get a refund for that ninety minutes of my life tangled jay lowi shawn hatosy has been doing the character actor thing in hollywood for a long time lowi in his first feature film gives hatosy a starring role and pairs him opposite established stars rachael leigh cook antitrust and jonathan rhys meyers titus as well as throwing lorraine bracco the sopranos into the mix and he still can t come up with a good movie now i ll watch jonathan rhys meyers in anything and i have and i still had trouble with this mess the basic idea david klein hatosy wakes up in a hospital with a police detective bracco at his side it seems kelin s girlfriend jenny cook and his best friend alan hammond meyers are both missing from the wreckage of hammond s car where klein was found klein relates the story of the relationship between the three of them to the detective piecemeal with scenes from the present intercut predictable boring cliched two dimensional need i go on if the ending of jodi picoult novels comes as a shock to you you may find the big reveal here to be a surprise no one else will 
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater i was bored out of my skull after about a half hour my friend who tends to be more progressive than i actually suggested we leave it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing ever perhaps i m biased however i highly recommend that no one get this movie the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant i tend to lean to the right but even i was entertained by v for vendetta despite it being blatant liberal propaganda if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil at least make it interesting 
wtf happened this is not about riverdance this is about what this disc did to murder it i popped it in expecting to seemy favorite dance scenes while conveiniently skipping the singing when all of a sudden i m at the finale all i could say was wtf wth or words to that effect this superbit edition cuts out half half of the scenes this performance had to offer including but certainly notlimited to riverdance and trading taps not only that but unless the high def only works for high end tvs the video quality is equal to my old vhs copy i sincerely hope this problem only occurs on my copy but i suggest to get a refund webpage ready because the atrocious product i received royally screws this great perform up the 
definitive portrayal of generation x for what that s worth many reviewers and critics said it best what do you do when the hero of the film ethan hawke is a complete a hole winona ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give ed wood jr a run for his money and stiller who is supposed to be the bad guy actually isn t that bad of a human being and winona s friends are the smarmy arrogant generation x punks who think they know everything when the reality is forgive the pun they don t know jack past generations would quote tolstoy and shakespeare generation x quotes tv commercials scooby doo cartoons star wars and bad sitcoms generation x is probably the most insincere generation ever detaching themselves and calling themselves ironic when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo intellectualism is this film an accurate portrayal of them yes in some ways is the film worth watching yeah at least once stiller gives a decent performance it s nicely shot and garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth this is probably due to the fact that garofalo actually has some substance herself as opposed to the character she plays check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence

this is a comedy seriously i didn t even think that this was a comedy until i came here and saw people saying it wasn t funny i got it as part of a boxed set of cary grant films purchased here and it s the only dud of the lot there was one scene that i will grant you was light and entertaining not laugh out loud but funny enough i won t spoil it by saying which one aside from that the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity most of all you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne grant and simmons in particular are strong but their efforts are ultimately squandered bob mitchum is ok but generally miscast and kerr s beauty and talent are basically wasted no amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here she goes from happily married to tramp in about minutes for no discernible reason overall acting c grantsimmons b directing fwriting d i understand that this film caters more to english tastes and that s fine but i found it most un satisfying 
i give it one star only because ralph fiennes is in it this movie has been terribly hyped up for reasons unbeknownst to me perhaps politically i presume in the usual hollywood fashion it has got to be one of the most slow moving boring uninteresting movies i have had the pain of having to waste my time on while attempting to sit through it however the one and only good thing about it is that ralph fiennes is in it but that is all don t waste your money and time on this dud as i m sorry i did 
a sad hyper ideological film of little consequence lots of stilted pseudo intellectual dialogue a pseudo existentialist hero a painfully ideological lecture against the death penalty stilted performances by brilliant actors a receipe for disaster why this film was a hit i have no idea 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
too slow expected more from this movie although deniro was good as usual 
painful to watch another product of hollywood s karaoke culture in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind we have in u an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war we get a cheap flag waving pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors and absurd scenarios an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit put this ridiculous movie in its own category u is just another thin over promoted throw away movie you ll forget the day after you see it 
bummer highlight dvd but yes the gay man won bummer ! this is only a hour minutes dvd of highlights from the first survivor the nudity is nothing really a rear end shot of one survivor and richard sitting down tucked under and walking naked but no private parts seen here having not seen all of the episodes of survivor i was hoping for a complete unedited uncensored version with all episodes collector s dvd set i guess it is not possible one special feature is the survivor inside the phenomenon a minute documentary which i found to be quite interesting especially how fair the game is the exhausting hard work producer mark burnett and the art department can do and how they managed to surprise the challenge survivor winner sean with a surprise visit from his father on the yacht at such short notice how they got his father there at such short notice is remarkable 
has not aged well when i was a kid i loved this movie and the tv series i was a devoted fan and built model rockets of the viper fighter and dreamed of one day being a starfighter pilot so you can imagine that i was very excited about getting this dvd unfortunately now that i am an adult it simply isn t possible to enjoy it any more the storyline is full of holes and every cliche you can think of the special effects are cheap it s just no fun anymore 
please not another season of this ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped 
only mildly interesting and no classic i saw this at the library and brought it home thinking it might be interesting to watch i very rarely watch films made after the s but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable it ended up being only mildly enjoyable and a bit boring i felt that within all the time it ran we didn t really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters seemed to remain in shallow waters all along the film was sort of good pretty photography and for the most part it seemed like the costumes hair way of speaking etc were accurate for the time period so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when but something just wasn t quite right and it is hard to know exactly what it was i was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate i think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity i am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed so i would not recommend this film for families with young children because of the nudity 
echo parque my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles i moved to echo park in late its depressing the vicious cycle of drugs dropping out and domestic violence and it s all here told through the eyes of latina teenagers it was easy to see the woman s hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played i didn t care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven i also found myself not caring about any of the characters so andso gets shot la la loo goes to jail whatever as an aside though the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto it turns out my next door neighbor in real life is also called ernesto luckily it s just a coincidence 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
something gets lost in translation i recently rented this movie having never seen it before i m wondering what all the kudo s were for denuve was pretty and had a boyfriend who was interested in her why did she lock herself in that ratty apartment did she have a history of mental illness if she didn t like being alone why didn t she go with her sister or visit her parents for the weekend we re never told i was confused and bored what a let down 
not the book the book was awesome the movie called eragon was a jumpy action flick that made little to no sense since when do elves not have pointy ears and when did dwarves get so tall in no way does the movie follow the book you will be wondering if the director read the book the worst part is the beginning pages smashed into minutes if the book didnt have an action scene in a chapter it was skipped the worst part about the making of this movie is that its so terrible people who see it and havent read the book will think that the book must be just as bad a weak adaptation of a brilliant young minds work 
bad device i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some s computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service

didn t work i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it didn t play anyway i gave up 
heartburn is the least of the ills caused by this movie a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron s husband jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull 
pale reflection of the original i saw this movie on t v a few years ago and since then i have bought the original tarzan mgm movies this version is a pale reflection of the film there is no smouldering chemistry between bo derek and miles o keeffe her character moves from being an overly confident heiress to a bumbling blushing little schoolgirl who is in a tizzy over tarzan s innocentnaturalvirgin state her father james parker richard harris is portrayed as an outspoken vulgar sex crazed expatriate obsessed with the elephants graveyard and any female he can find o keeffes gives a wooden performance as tarzan three chimpanzees and a lone orangutan follows the lord of the apes if you are looking for a great performance by legends in the business check out the b w originals which for all their flaws have lasted for decades if you just want to gape at bo derek half naked this is the movie for you 
a tale told by a teenager signifying the premise that one could change specific events in ones past through psychic concentration could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller i don t condemn the film s corollary either that each change produces new unforseeable tragedies it s the way the story is told its ham fisted dialogue and plot its forced obscenity at every turn that reveals its teen sensibilities it is therefore fitting that the director s preferred ending is included here it is the perfect catharsis for teens who wish i was never born !

poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
overhyped overrated and a big waste of money this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen it was boring and lacked any climatic moments during the entire hour and a half i managed to squeeze out a couple chuckles but don t expect to get much more i would not recommend this movie to anyone

stars this movie sucks sometimes they come back is a terrible attempt at a horror movie i love tim matheson and i think he is a very good actor but this movie is just incredibly lame the idea that these four little punks with leather jackets on are supposed to be scary as ghosts simply does nothing for me except make me thoroughly disappointed that i wasted my time watching this crap the is movie is a joke ! the scene this movie is based on is a sad scene for sure but to base the whole movie on it is going to far with nothing basically this whole movie is much ado about nothing i think the biggest joke and the most terrible thing about this movie are these little leather jacket wearing punks as ghosts are supposed to scare the viewer and it simply does not work the premise behind this movie is flawed and lacking in substance from which a horror movie can be successfully derived sometimes they come back is entirely ineffective as a horror movie and evokes only laughter from a sophisticated horror movie fan the sequel is so bad it is not worthy of a comment some people call sometimes they come back a good horror movie i just call it rubbish 
what s up with that i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show 
a lot of green light and not much else rule number one if you re making a stephen king movie especially if it s a tv movie make it scary or don t make it at all ! the tommyknockers fails to do this miserably ! for most of the film you re watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions granted that s all in the book but it written chillingly by king in a way only he can do it there are some exciting alien moments at the end but by then it s too late you ve just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an x files episode on the plus side i had no problem watching the infamous traci lords act like like a total slut ! bless her 
a bomb of a flick except for a few good gore effects this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out ! the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks 
did not work the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha 
worst movie i ve ever seen i would have given this film stars if possible this film was long boring and painful to watch if you like jane austen films or other bbc period films do not be deceived by this one it is nothing like those types of films 
should have been made in america this film was very confusing and boring the dark tone of the scenery was depressing hard to follow i really think this should have been either colorful for an audience of children or more graphic for an adult audience it s almost like the director wasen t sure which audience he wanted to please and doing so didn t please either one skip it 
be warned i love this film it s epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves i d have given stars if it had so the minus three is for the appaling print one of the worst i ve ever seen 
rediscovering my folks this is a film that teachs you about not only being a father but how to become a son about being truthful to your roots and your futur

chop ! chop what do holly hunter and burt reynolds have in common just another flick about a gal who falls for an abuser this time with the gimicks of a waterlogged piano and exotic new zealand maori the tribe had it right though ignore these two losers and stick with the trees 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
confusing vagueand disappointing good cast adaptation of king lear don t bother unless you are really bored 
virginal encounters might be a better title all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why i couldn t even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end in spite of my being a certifiable dirty old man 
forget it what this film has is an interesting premise and storyline but unfortunatley it becomes to silly and ridicoulos and the car chase scenes didn t help either bruce willis plays the part of a psychologist that while on vacation visits a friend of his bob moore who is also a psychologist and is later murdered and the chief suspect is in his therapy group bob is determined to find the killer and is also helped by a detective there is also a young atractive woman played by jane march who gets involved with bruce willis s character dr bill capa the films only intresting thing is the therapy group itself which has some odd characters otherwise the film was a lame attempt of being a thriller now i m not a big fan of bruce willis but i have seen much better films with him in it than this including die hard trilogy last man standing and the sixth sense

harriet is good but the rest of the film i gotta give it to that little girl who plays harriet in the movie she did a great job but i found rosie o donnells performance really lacking which made the film a little boring to watch at times 
imho dumb movie after seeing some of the other amazon reviews of this movie and the fact that jason swartzman was in it after having seen him for the first time in rushmore a wonderful film i had to purchase a copy of this dvd for myself to view it s got a wonderful cast of fine actors but i found this movie really dumb one critic on the dvd box claimed this was laugh out loud funny really what movie was he watching i strained a chuckle here and there but that was about it for me the lily tomlin dustin hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script i know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie but i didn t find much to snicker about 
cant watch i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that didn t play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok 
unbox video not yet working will not play once video was downloaded i get the error message can not play file please try again later error x i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed i was told the unbox saturday and sunday hours i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again feb 
wasting space on my dvd shelf i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college and because he spoke so highly of it i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it i definitely regret that decision if you re thinking of buying it rent it first it was dull and obnoxious not to mention weird the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate which is why i gave it star instead of however if you re still interested definitely rent it you might enjoy it 
it was egh i gave it two stars because while i didn t hate it it was dull and predictable i see beter plots on tv s starsky and hutch it probably wouldn t have been so bad if i didn t have to use subtitles i found myself more interested in looking at the text than watching the movie i know that s only my opinion but i watch a lot of dvd s and i think i know what i like and don t like 
great stars good idea mediocre execution a comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of heaven fanny ardant victoria abril and hell gael garcia bernal penelope cruz battling over the soul of a mexican boxer is promising but this attempt at satire full of symbolism hell is represented by english speaking executives for example is clumsily executed only rarely amusing and the superb fanny ardant is not given anything to do what a waste ! you ll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors 
best movie with no conclusion i ve ever seen ok i m a scifi fan i read the scifi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me and it really was good right up to the end just one problem they forgot to write the end what happened did they run out of money did the writer write himself into a corner there was no climax conclusion or resolution you can argue till you are blue in the face about pan scan i prefer movies with an ending if you are looking for a great unfinished story this one is for you 
a great b movie many have seen this movie on tv many times for a b movie it is great fun and interesting to watch no extras on the dvd i wish they did add something from behind the scenes etc 
not very good i love sci fi and hate this movie when i mean i love sci fi i will accept plot flaws to a good premise or special effects this movie has no plot and no premise the special affects are good but not enough to call the movie even remotely enjoyable complete dissapointment my cents 
sorry this movie is so freakin stupid yes its funny but so very dumb not good dumb bad dumb terribly painfully stupid funny at times best avoided or taken in small doses 
pi when a movie producer in foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain black white and jittery gray the result had better be good that fraction of members of the technicolor drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money push play alongside mr benefit ofadoubt and strain to see if it works thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically that of color the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that despite some grand intention do not work or in the alternative do not work as well citing two examples sin city which is near tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white tantamount to robbery and good night america which is all and about the same the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one s mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one s point one might be better served as a charcoal artist color is the medium of life from a budgetary perspective black and white films save money as the challenges of color which in a good feature can be excessive are thus eliminated yet complications arise for instance i wasn t sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy s hand similarly the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink in shades of course and we would never know yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie or is it one wonders however that if pi production would have had more money would they have opted for color moot point it s done notwithstanding the obvious that i don t prefer black and white movies and incidentally don t know lots of people who do pi although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work clever symbolism and high octane guts seems to lanquish for other reasons despite pi s visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot wired throughout spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves after max s third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost as as result the movie stays earthbound weighted down by a mediocre revolving door plotline obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there failing repetitive effect and thin uninspiring d support cast leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn t won the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine airborne one second belly down the next as a fine creative exercise the creators are praised for their effort and bravery pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush hour traffic and commands the watcher s attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin off a beautiful mind 
unbelievable crap this movie could ve been something had they gotten some real actors a script and a director well they didn t and this movie is an embarassment to mankind 
bad porn the setting of this film is in the late s just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the vcr and the subsequent explosion of pornographic vhs tapes burt reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be artistic in his craft heather graham plays his psycho starlet and mark wahlberg plays a porn star who is welllets just say endowed wahlbergs character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of wahlberg s character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to john holmes although i don t know if the film makers would admit as much at any rate he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his package this hubris leads to his un doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and lots of shady characters this sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie well it could have been but all the way through there seems to be something missing there are times the film seems to try and convey a message but i m not really sure one thing i do know is that i quickly remembered why i ve never cared for wahlberg he has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt also i was expecting a lot more skin than what the film delivered given the context of the film one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women that s simply not the case in the end however the biggest problem of this movie isn t wahlberg or the lack of nudity the difficulty is that it s just plain boring i have more than a passing interest in the history of porn and yet this flick failed to grab me

not what i was looking for this movie concentrates on cobb as a bitter old drunk desperately trying to get his life story told from his point of view i expected to see more scenes from when he was playing ball but sadly there is really only one scene that showed his legendary hitting and baserunning and that scene is very short and quite poor if you are interested in what cobb was like as an old angry man go for it if you are interested in cobb as the greatest offensive ballplayer ever skip this one in a hurry other than that i thought the movie on its own merits as a movie was pretty lousy i regret buying it 
not as funny or creative or whimsical as the first two this rugrats movie is the worst of the three obviously it was made for promotion and cash more than anything nickelodeon didn t consider the plot in the process so the movie suffers the plot is complex yet it still manages to be too simple to be taken seriously and it has about fifty holes and sub plots the movie is too complex for even a yearold to grasp since rugrats is aimed for year olds they won t get it the main promotions for the movie were the scratch and sniff sequence also burger king promotion to go with that and the fact that spike would now talk hah ! spike talked in the episode of the series about chuckie s dreams besides smelling some disgusting card that you can smell anytime not during the movie isn t fun the burger smells more like spoiled milk anyway the movie is fluffy and light and tries for a few forced laughs but it dosen t happen debbie s well publicized line and the quotthat is so wrong quot line and the wedgie dance are among the stupidest things i have ever seen maybe an yearold would disagree being i found the humour pretty dumb so you re aware i love the series this movie just wasn t creative at all it was more of a thornberry type flick and finally it just isn t whimsical or special in any way not recommended for anything except a rental from the video store if that 
movie is great but unbox is uncooked movie got through and just quit no problem this is windows right just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i can t restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i m not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it 
why what s the point there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i don t need to add anything in that regard but what on earth does a lesbian sub story in both regards have to do with the story as a whole nothing so we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue grass music and the appalachian way of life that instead heads for the trash bin 
not good enough this had so much more potential but bad writing and animation made it seem like a drag just watch a rerun of the show instead of getting this 
amazon com likes to take my money this is another story that i don t know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails doesn t seem to work if they didn t have the best prices for movies i d leave 
the usual cardone fare the forsaken j s cardone i should probably know better by now and yet i still subject myself to j s cardone movies in this one sean a guy dawsons creek s kerr smith hired to drive a car from los angeles to miami picks up a hitchhiker nick final destination s brendan fehr in the middle of the desert the two of them encounter megan a sick girl coyote ugly s izabella miko when they stop for the night in town nick insists she come with them saying he knows what s wrong with her and eventually tells sean that the group have vampires on their tail well the word vampires doesn t exactly crop up seriously but come on you know what they are the rest of the movie can be summed up with things blow up cardone is one of the straight toscifichanel directors who fills his movies with young andbeautifuls who have limited if any acting ability but are relatively easy on the eyes in their defense this is not a new tactic witness the brilliant film career of say farrah fawcett smith is a bit above the average y nb in acting ability though the other two here are right on the mark the minor characters don t have much to go on either as the script came straight out of a write your first screenplay in twenty one days kind of book which could make a passable film if you had a really original or even a really good fast paced plot alas no such thing exists here this movie deserves a mercifully quick slide into obscurity about the only was i can imagine it having any longevity at all is if it s somehow turned into a drinking game 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
sucks eggs what another stupid sequel to a crappy horror mess i did not know that studios were this desperate for some lousy cash this franchise needs to be destroyed skip this and look at another product 
for jarheads i too wasn t very impressed with jarhead i thought half way through that jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the marines and perhaps other branches of the military for those of us who haven t i just don t think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested as someone else mentione i too thought it was going to be a more modern version of full metal jacket but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn t 
good for a frisbee don t waste your time with this folks this movie is bad bad bad ! horrible acting stupid story prince directed it himself hey he can t be good at everything and outrageously ridiculous dialogue but a few of the songs aren t bad mountains girls and boys sometimes it snows in april and that s why i m even giving it one star this is a really dumb tale about prince and morris day s valet jerome benton going to france where the former is a gigolo who falls in love the one thing good i can say about this slop for the hogs is that it s better than the laxative onfilm graffiti bridge but if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet shooting then go for it 
stars i m sure it was more exciting in the early s i guess i missed the point i can see how this film could be considered a horror classic i m sure the violence was ground breaking in in fact one of the comments in the making of on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres i don t think it s a well done film overall it s lacking in story music direction and suspense the acting is not too bad but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes if i was craving some good s horror i d rather watch i spit on your grave or the texas chainsaw massacre 
not as titled i bought this in the expectation that it would cover the people of the new world as they existed before columbus instead it was basically a recap of the cruelty of the europeans to the native populations viewed through the standards and sensibilities of today i read bury my heary at wounded knee and the chronicle of the american indian s complaint odd years ago and being part cherokee there was nothing new in the dvds correction there were many new things most of which didn t happen a good example is the dvd version of the conquering of the aztec actually they were called mexica but the dvd got that wrong as well read conquest by hugh thomas for the best book on the subject 
same thing the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
heartburn or men beware ! most women only want to breed this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own self worth is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl s movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant quothomemakerquot if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too 
don t support bootleg editions this is an excellent video but any true fan of x will refuse to buy it because the company producing this dvd and has the legal rights to the film are not allowing any proceeds to go to the band ! vhs version and laserdisc versions are available online the band is trying to reacquire their rights to this production support the band not bootleggers 
read my review for skyscraper it s the same thing even though it s not a quotmoviequot everything i said on my skyscraper to the limit review applies her 
a disappointment first of all i am a joy division and new order fan therefore i tried to like this really i did sadly this film stinks the focus is not on the bands themselves but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson what a monster ! either it was the actor s depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life maybe i m not british but i did not find hour party people to be very funny only a few scenes made me grin the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film in addition the camera work was very jerky looked like it was done by a novice and yes i m one myself having made two movies the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division too bad the members of this band are minor characters i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much much better 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
assigning blame to the supernatural the author basically believes that satan rules the world with the help of evil angels and demons he bases this a bit on scripture but just as much on the fact that it s the best answer he can think of for why if there is a good god bad things happen to good people or good people do bad things he s fixated on the question of blame cant blame god because god is good can t blame the good christian because that would be unchristian ergo we should blame satan if you re inclined to blame tragedy and sin on satan and his minions this is the book for you otherwise you probably won t make it through the first pages that said the author is a good writer and has a lot of powerful anecdotes to illustrate his point and his advice is essentially to be aware of your own circumstances desires and surroundings and think about the consequences of your choices in light of your faith which is good if obvious advice for anyone 
wasted that should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high profile cast normally respectable director are put to another possible title is its all about the groceries cause i m hard pressed to think of a reason other than money why anybody involved would ve signed on to this project it starts promisingly with atmospheric shots of the golden gate bridge rising through fog over san francisco the camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman s throat once again ashley judd is a victim in jeopardy so it seems then the victim proceeds to open a can of whoop a all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp one starts to think that this might be getting good especially after ashley s apparently super competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues a pretty hefty drinking problem a propensity for picking up strangers in bars having rough sex with them and some grisly skeletons in her closet i was interested to see what judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim unfortunately not enough ms judd is a luminously beautiful actress even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough i suppose it is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame she has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like jessica though playing it distressingly one note is she ecstatic depressed in a drug induced stupor the way judd plays it it could be any or all of the above i like ashley judd but she is in danger of turning into the female version of richard gere a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk food roles that do not challenge her talent kiss the girls was the high water mark each subsequent film has been weaker than the last this movie is worth the price of a rental but i d take a pass on purchasing it for a better treatment of female copwithdarksecretsandissues a stronger movie all around i recommend murder by numbers with sandra bullock 
give me an s ! give me an h ! give me an i if the sight of a lb man s bare hindquarters terrifies you stay away ! if the thought of a middle aged lief garrett rapping fills your veins w icewater stay away ! if foot tall s hairstyles make you cringe in fear stay away ! yes this is cheerleader camp a film full of cheerleading routines that may be too intense for some viewers ! watch as yo teenagers fight to survive against an unknown killer among them ! see the horror as pom poms swish and shake ! stand astonished during the hideous school mascots dance off feel the life drain from your body as minutes simply disappear ! you have been chosen you are doomed 
these video game adaptations need to be taken more seriously to be honest i never really had much fate in video game adaptations most of them in the past have failed miserably here resident evil apocalyse has made it even worse a continuation from the first so so resident evil film umberella have decided to re open the hive unknowingly letting the t virus out throughout the city turning the people of racoon city into zombies firsts of all i love the resident evil video games especially resident evil its what gave me encouragment to see this film before i actually saw this film i was thinking that this might be in some way decent to be honest it didnt even seem in anyway related to the resident evil series when it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself what makes the actuall game itself such a success if you take silent hill for instance probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success they have really taken the silent hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done it actually felt like silent hill but in this case it looks like the resident evil video games where just thrown aside there is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like resident evil environment and the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by heavy metal music it felt like an absolute joke it seems that they didnt even take the resident evil video games into consideration and without it this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the resident evil title this is just a pointless action sci fi film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously this is an insult to the resident evil video game series 
painfully dull you know the feeling that feeling of oh my gosh how did i ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end well that s what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film unfortunately because of its all star cast although this wouldn t be the first time in movie history where an all star cast is wasted aside from an interesting peek into the world of yale s secret skull and bones society a delightful cameo by joe pesci and a few too cute byhalf zingers this movie has little or nothing to offer it doesn t keep one s attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on you realize that you don t even care about the characters matt damon s skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry especially with the beautiful angelina jolie and he is laughably miscast as a father in fairness however with the script he s been given it s hard to see how damon could have done much better the pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends a huge disappoinment especially since director deniro is such a talented actor skip it 
pointless eric maibus and scott bairstow have become fine young actors and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal pointless lurid and sadistic movie dee wallace stone should be ashamed for participating maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult with no conscience morals or regard for anyone but himself bairstow plays the usual quotmisunderstoodquot teen who looks to the group for acceptance the script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence enough is enough if this is the way teens talk then steer me clear folks there is no heart or soul in this movie and no reason to rent or buy no stars c mon amazon when you gonna give us the stars options 
what was i thinking i watched this movie last evening and i have to say that i have never seen weird confusing movie since monkies i m still confused the plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing it s all about lucid dreams and tom cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him the film is basically all a blur from start to finish it s a dreadful mix of sci fi nonsense and obvious fake romance why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway don t buy this film on dvd or you ll be wasting your money i m sorry if you ve found this review uninformative but since vanilla sky is really about nothing whatsoever it s very hard to go into much detail 
defective filmmaking willy wonka meets dr strangelove in this one ofakind cinematic disaster barry levinson s longtime dream project emerges as a garish nightmare the impressive production design wears out its welcome after five minutes while a talented cast sinks in the big budget quagmire another unfilmable concept that somehow received the hollywood green light 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
unwatchable i recorded this from tv and tried to watch it i even tried to just watch a little each day to see if there was anything remotely funny in it i finally gave up yesterday and erased it i actually felt sorry for peter o toole that he had to do the unfunny things he had to do in this movie life is too short to sit through this thing amazing that some people think it s great unbearably bad 
terribly disappointed curse words i purchased this movie for my year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was pg that it would be fine also the market for transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere wow were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie these were not just words like shoot or dang but the real deal i remember transformers when i was growing up and i certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons i am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office concerned in alabam 
science fiction it s not the basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting how does a man trained as a killingmachine integrate back into society yes it s been done before but still holds promise the plot was adequate the acting was believable no complaints there i particularly enjoyed sean pertwee as mace and jason isaacs has long been a favorite actor but what ruined the movie for me was the science i m not a fanatic i have no problems with ftl travel or spaceships banking on turns or loud explosions in space in movies and i realize that movies are not real but i ve never seen more bad science in any one movie my son and i watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers i could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie but it would take me all night it spoiled the whole movie for me 
i prefer this movie was ok i do prefer the messenger starring milla jovovich milla is exceptional in that version 
i want to tell you my secret now m night shyamalan s the sixth sense is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema however the mere use of misdirection does not guarantee that a film will wind up being any good psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis returns home one evening after receiving an award for his work with children a former patient awaits him there and shoots him in front of his wife time passes and crowe tries to put the incident behind him by immersing himself in a new case crowe takes on a new patient named cole sear haley joel osment who claims that he is able to see dead people around him the sixth sense created a sensation upon its release as filmgoers relished its twist ending yet if the truth be told the ending will not come as a surprise to fantasy and science fiction fans or to those who are actually paying attention to the events unfolding onscreen rather than sitting back and just going along for the ride the entire success of the sixth sense hinges on whether you are able to figure out the ending ahead of time and unfortunately shyamalan s use of misdirection just does not mask the final revelation effectively enough from the beginning of the film one knows that something is amiss and the twist becomes more and more obvious as the story continues to unfold the acting is first rate with willis osment toni collette and olivia williams turning in great work willis in particular turns in an interesting performance that is a departure from his more action oriented roles however even with all the quality acting on display you just cannot shake the feeling that the the sixth sense is essentially just a drawn out twilight zone episode when all is said and done 
how can i not forget this movie it so desperately needs a makeover and being that this movie is close to twenty years old makes it possible the book passed through several hands as a film property and eventually ended up in those of wes craven his name was most certainly at the forefront of horror directors the result ugly stereotypes anorexic socio political allegory scant scares and bill pullman that s the serpent and the rainbow in a nutshell based on wade davis novel wes craven s lame documentary flavored horror story follows anthropologist dennis alan pullman as he searches revolutionary haiti for a mystery drug that reportedly raises the dead with the help of a local psychiatric institution doctor mona lisa s cathy tyson alan undergoes a crash coarse in the island s history discovering a culture where percent of the population practices voodoo including an evil political leader zakes mokae who s using zombifying white powder as a means of silencing opponents imagery of people being buried alive is the film s calling card and craven handles his suffocating coffin encased dream sequences with sufficient skill yet in every other respect the film is either offensive or incompetent from the sight of blacks behaving like superstitious witch doctors or the dance floor gyrating possessed to pullman s unbearably overwrought performance as the altruistic alan to the persistently aggravating narration which wants to function as helpful connective tissue between scenes but instead only provides a wealth of superfluous information that neither complements nor amplifies the already dull pointless action i have seen this movie twice in my life and if its one thing serpent and the rainbow is it s stylish filmed in my homeland the movie is loaded with colorful scenery there s tons of unforgettable religious imagery due in no small part to the colorful nature of voodoo as well as lots of great scenes in haitian graveyards that stick in the brain there s also tons of craven style shots the nightmare sequences reminded me immensely of cravens previous works as well as some bits that came out rather nicely the shot of a man inside the coffin being lowered into the ground performances are decent especially zakes mokae who plays peytraud with subtly psychotic menace pullman is as wooden as ever how does this guy keep his job delivering lines right from that invisible teleprompter hanging about six inches from his nose i also question the based on a true story factor people tearing their own head off and tossing them isn t true to life hollywood at times loves to pick on voodoo given its minority status among the faiths and treat it a bit backwards in reality voodoo is not based on evil premises as is often portrayed but instead has it s foundation in catholicism the spirits that are such cornerstones of voodoo are in effect angels with god and jesus reigning supreme over all and there is a dark side it is the dark side where the elements of control over others and evil show themselves and this dark world of evil voodoo is indeed scary the trouble is when making a movie with voodoo elements it takes time and effort to explain the reality of the practice and it is much easier to just rely on the frightening stereotypes instead but in this film craven explores voodoo on a rather scientific level although many of the events depicted are still mystic they are always rational and if they actually venture into the realms of the supernatural craven makes sure the viewer understands that voodoo has also very much to do with mental states and hallucinations inseparably embedded in the haitian culture this movie could have been so much better if craven would have learned that the scariest things often have nothing to do with special effects but the root of all recommending this film probably wouldn t be very wise in my part but reading the book is highly beneficial 
a waste of time a typical altman film made to please himself not an audience i don t know how he keeps getting financing no one sees them except family and friends additionally it suffers from soft focus out of focus photography that will drive you nuts ! after awhile you don t give a damn whether they have a wedding or not 
you get what you pay for this is practicly a made for tv movie it was obviously filmed in the s because of their clothes cars and lifestyles don t be fooled like i was the review said there was lesbian sex in the movie not even close i got it because i m one of those guys that like to watch lesbian sex and i was gravely disapointed it has pretty women in it but you never see much sigh i didn t waste too much money 
not widescreen i didn t even open this copy of gothic as soon as i realized it wasn t letterboxed i immediately returned it i ve seen the movie before i love ken russell but i wont watch it if isn t in letterbox 
big bad mama ii not what you were looking for if you were hoping for a skin flick this is not it a couple of minutes of long shots of the young girls swimming topless and one real nice look at julie mccullouh in bed is not enough too qualify the acting is awful angie looks great for her age still not enough 
rumor has it perpetuates a gender double standard asking you to embrace a character that you would loathe if it were a man i know that the critical reception to rumor has it was very chilly but something about the idea of the film really appealed to me the concept the plot conceit is a genuinely clever notion being a fan of the graduate i was interested to see how well they would integrate the characters of that film with the real life counterpoints in this film i mean come on shirley maclaine representing mrs robinson and kevin costner as ben braddock seems like a great idea ! but alas when all is said and done an amusing and well conceived setup did not equal a satisfying movie experience for me jennifer aniston returns to her pasadena homestead with her new fiance played by mark ruffalo plagued with doubts about her engagement and seemingly disengaged from any real affection for her own family she hears a rumor that leads her to suspect that the book and film of the graduate were based on her deceased mother s experiences confirming that her grandmother maclaine was indeed the mrs robinson character she deduces that her mother had a fling prior to marrying her father thus with the notion that she might be the daughter of this man she sets off to find the truth encountering costner as the potential daddy and ben braddock character she discovers truths about herself and her family all of this plays out very routinely but the supporting actors are engaging and comfortable it s always great to see maclaine but she offers nothing new or inventive in this performance its the standard brassy maclaine persona we ve come to expect costner continues to embrace his middle aged status and has thus developed into a far more interesting actor than he used to be but for a more nuanced and astute role check him out in the upside of anger with the luminous joan allen and mark ruffalo a great serious actor continues to play lightly as a romantic leading man recently cast with witherspoon garner and now aniston in lightweight fluff i do miss the more challenging roles he used to take on but it is aniston s character to me that is a despicable movie creation one that i ve seen all too frequently but this one is supposed to be endearing born into a life of privilege she has accomplished nothing in her years and has become a self involved and unpleasant womanchild she floats through her sister s wedding as if it s all some great inconvenience she doesn t think twice about mistreating a man who loves her she never acts on anything that doesn t blatantly promote her own self interest i m just so tired of it its not charming don t get me wrong there are plenty of manchild movies too more so even about men who still act as if they were adolescent but think about those movies the manchild is an object of scorn and ridicule we laugh at him but rumor has it doesn t ask you to laugh at aniston s social ineptitude and selfishness far from it were supposed to embrace it and identify with her as a real person well frankly i wished everyone in aniston s life would abandon her because of her behavior so that she d learn to grow up but of course this is wish fulfillment and she learns about life while retaining everything of value there is never any consequence to being a nasty person this gender double standard really bothers me and the fact that i genuinely disliked the central character obviously i didn t care for this film otherwise it would have been a fairly generic picture but these two things caused me to feel strongly and negatively i am giving it an extra star for a good idea but unfortunately it didn t pan out for me kgharris 
mixed feelings i have very mixed feeling about this tape when i bought it i did not realize it was for new mothers i have cindy s two previous workouts and love them both so i purchased this without question here are some random thoughts i enjoyed the different length workouts you don t always have minutes to workout even if you aren t a parent these workouts are lead by kathy kaehler not by cindy like her other tapes i found kathy uninspiring and uninteresting cindy does not seem as familiar with this workout as she is with the radu ones she is more window dressing in this video the amount of repetitions for the movements varies greatly which i found very annoying the warm up and cool down are very very short even on the minute workout cthe music will put you to sleep i suggest hitting the mute button on your tv and listening to your own music if you are a new mother or beginner this is a good tape to ease you into a workout routine however i believe you will quickly outgrow it 
great acting but a bad story line mario van peebles patsy kensit and paula marshall are all talented individuals whose talent went to waste in this film the storyline of crime busting werewolves was really dumb the main werewolf itself looked like a joke in comparison to the werewolf in quotan american werewolf in london quot 
amazon sucks i live in the uk and amazon doesn t allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users 
far and away very disappointed because i can t watch it on my dvd player i would have asked for a refund and returned it but don t know how to go about doing that on amazon 
sum of all stars zero maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat on top of that the acting was horrible this movie didn t take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor 
will carrie wind up with zhivago or stalin oops i must be mixing up my stories an insufferable view of life among a claque of ruskie girlfriends from the late s to the late s nothing more than sex the city transplanted to moscow in the khruschev and brezhnev eras if thats your cup of borscht more power to you 
can t bring myself to say more i love a good action movie love them so what weent wrong well the effects were there but it all seemed so detached we may have seen most of the action sequences you can do on a ship previously or we may not bottom line is this if you are going to have an action sequence make it exciting watching the dvd of this i wasn t able to be drawn in sufficiently to keep me from checking my email at less than minutes in length a boring action movie is just plain wrong and that s what poseidon is 
ripoff i purchased the unbox version or the international release of eragon the movies picture disappeared after minutes but not the sound amazon should give me a refund of this defective download if they don t it will be the last dl i purchase

travesty an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse worst of the worst abc afterschool specials if you had not read the book you would be unable to follow what was happening some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time the original evil dead with all its flaws is a better put together film than this one this movie is flat out painful to watch you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do it all seems so random read the book if you see this movie in a rental store just move along please nothing to see here 
so awful i turned it off i saw this film on tv several years ago and started watching it because william hurt is one of my favorite actors i got as far as the monkey man scene and turned it off it was so ridiculous and just plain bad i can probably count on one hand the number of movies i have not watched all the way through i even suffer through the bad and boring ones i couldn t take another minute of this one however 
stupid boring gross this movie is stupid beyond words i watched a half hour of it and could not watch any more i was so lost and bored makes no sense talks about creepy gross and disgusting things is boring and stupid don t waste time on this dull as dust film 
warning incomplete episode the episodes in this series have an average running time of minutes this one happens to be only minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me i still got jipped let s hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
star flick but zero star digi download service i m thankful kenneth branagh s hamlet is available in digital format given all the years it s been stalled out available only in vhs format but geez what a hokey way of making it available as another reviewer points out the amazon unbox video player required to access the movie on the pc demands that it be able to scan your system for whatever and it likes to take it s own sweet time to be able to do it just what we all want another service dominating our system resources for it s own exclusive purposes if you re running with portable devices add amazon unbox to the list of services that want to get sync d up to your device and unfortunately despite the sys requirements indicating compatibility with windows media center my hopes that the xbox could access the video through the media connect back end did not pan out despite the xbox recognizing the video it was locked out by amazon s protection of the video despite all this exclusive lock down of the content they do make it possible to obtain one copy on your portable device so i did the download took a day got it running with amazon unbox on the pc and sync d up with a zen vision m and then uninstalled all the amazon unbox stuff and now am able to only play it on the vision m and connected video devices not optimal but a somewhat improved over vhs copy playable until a high def release comes out and we hopefully get sorted out on all the drm quandry 
beware of unbox amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i didn t really want it i just thought i d try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again and the directions don t work so i don t even have the free stuff i paid for 
he was fired from gm for calling off and showing up late what a joke people believe the stupidest things do some research and you will see that this is a joke i hated it 
for joe dallesandro fans only if you are looking for a good story and character development this movie dissapoints the story is rather thin and slow with more focus on joe s good looks a irritatating aspect of the dvd was white flashes occuring at innapropriate moments during the movie 
shark from some other footage attack shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it s mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie 
awful i rented this movie from netflix recently expecting a wonderfully campy cheesy horror film wrong its just an hour and a half of boring film the plot is lacking the characters are annoying especially duane its simply a ridiculous film 
where is shania twain when you do a search for shania twain this video pops up i can t even find her in the half time show is there a football player with the same name she is the greatest female vocalist of all time and is much prettier than those football players but i am sure she doesn t play football lo 
becomes old very fast the first five minutes of the dvd was interesting however after that i found that i was forcing myself to watch it without a great deal of enjoyment 
okay for years ago maybe this movie is laughable today it s very dated and it shows it s not worth your time the acting is so so but felt forced like william shatner style the storyline is okay by today s standards it appears like a low budget flick 
a putrid stinker of a film this has to be one of the worst movies i ve ever wasted my time watching ! don t dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic drew barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant random nudity the storyline could have worked yet the movie is pathetically low budget the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat it is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with drew barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point it s so bad that i had to come here to vent about it online the director was obviously a film school drop out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn 
a classic celebration of war one of the first genres moviemakers turn to when wanting to stir up a little historical or emotional reflection is war films about war make up some of the oldest in the history of the media many of them about battles that never took place but throw in a dash of historical accuracy here and there and at the producers discretion and you have a recipe for classic status exhibit a zulu nevermind that this is the retelling of a senseless battle fought in the name of british colonial expansion in which countless men died brits and africans alike who cares that the zulu empire was as oppressive and unforgiving as any tribe on the continent forget that the ultimate outcome victory at ulundi resulted in british control of zululand and naturally a barbarous system of apartheid for the next years as one reviewer pointed out the africans who played extra roles in the film weren t even able to go see the movie under the current policies of apartheid nevermind all that tally ho mates this is war and war is classic gather round and hear a tale of glory courage and heroism again sure the heroes in question are fighting in the name of racism and greed but fighting bravely nonetheless and to counter any suggestion that the filmmakers condescend to the adversary the zulus are presented as equally brave yes bravery abounds after all what better match for the white man s unflinching imperative than another power hungry merciless but brave army that of the zulus make no mistake this war story is told from the perspective of the white minority in southern africa there are no significant individual characters on the african side and looking at things from that angle one would have to spin the british effort in a somewhat positive light or never sleep another night but to pretend that it is accurate or just to arbitrarily assign themes like glory and patriotism to what adds up to brutal militarism is to deceive one s self utterly if anyone can tell me how the effort to defend british fortifications in south africa in has made africa or the world a better place i will gladly take it all back in the meantime filmmakers will continue to rouse passionate armchair patriotism recalling the brave men who sacrificed their lives for the greater good whatever that might have been unfortunately it is the public willingness to accept these tales as accurate these missions as noble and these surges of testosterone as plenty justification that many more men and women will be needlessly sacrificed for years to come zulu is indeed a classic war movie but ask yourself is that always a good thing 
the book is better this film is based on one of my favourite books so i was really looking forward to seeing it despite great performances by blanchett and fienes it just doesn t hold together well too much of what is in the book has been left out and that which is there lacks weight the characters in the book are so much more complex and endearing the book was very moving and engaging while the movie is not there is also an ending tacked on that doesn t exist in the book and that always annoys me i was very disappointed i think had i not read the book i d have stopped watching the movie about into it 
spiderman high boltage villains i found the dvd to be completey inappropriate for children too much violance and too much swearing my kids watched minutes of it and its now in the garbage 
not as avertised editted movie the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens very disapointtin

smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated

girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
jason goes to hell i bought most the friday the th dvds around halloween time at a discount of course i couldn t find this one even thought it was at wal mart for a long time before that in my opinion this one wasn t very good at all compared to all the rest i was greatly disappointed it was just so fake and not realistic at all very cheesy for those who wish to complete the set this one is part of it this one was so awful and far from the other ones so fake it s shameful bad script it jumped the shark jason yes that s my real name 
will denis leary ever figure out he can t act well the title kind of says it all dull uglyboring men in a dull ugly boring movie also the most unreallistic sexual pairing in the world stunningly beautiful elizabeth hurley with ugly skinny beaked nosed denis leary steve buscemi is comical as usual and adds the only bright spot to the film 
why the charge curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
mediocre offering male physiques help an hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay there isn t much else granted there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments but it s often dull 
biscuit eating fools the film makers will walk the plank in shark infested waters for this one blackbeards ghost does not wander around a random college campus making smart comments pulling lame pranks and acting like a low life burn out loser i do blackbeard is obviously drunk on his ghost ship in the caribbean the film makers are obviously the heirs to filthy british royalty carrying out a plot to give pirates everywhere a bad name 
the end of a great show begins the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the s it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series it was a travesty to see optimus prime the greatest of the transformers fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor rodimus prime who proved incapable of leadership galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie they were forgettable it amuses me that fans are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did as a fan i was insulted perhaps these other fans have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage 
i ve been cheated by amazon it really sucks tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states crikey ill have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly whatta shame amazon dot com let s send a csi to yer headquarters 
not happy this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
could have been better written could have been better written better acted better photographed way too many flashbacks this whole thing is kind of a mess really lacks cohesiveness premise is interesting enough and a truly gifted director might have made a great film out of it the guy who directed this is no akira kurosawa that s for sure 
warning wrong episode this item is supposedly titled ufos the first encounters it is however an episode about reincarnation it is incorrectly labeled do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
star trek city on the edge of forever my favorite show of the trek series but there s no way i d buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wont burn to dvd so can t play it on my television don t bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd 
sum of all stars zero maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat on top of that the acting was horrible this movie didn t take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor 
redneck extravanganza on a budget this a dreadful example of what jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat husbandsloversthe only reason to watch it would be because mamie van doren was also in it but be aware and i read that in a biography about jayne that in their contracts was specified that they would not appear together in any scene whatsoever so you see them separately in different scenes also be aware that if you blink you will not see either of the blonde beauties conclusionget this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ol south or someone with a white hood showing his eyes onl 
poor support this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet 
mud slow dull and done on the cheapstick with zulu and read your history book s far more entertaining 
and the point is i just didn t get it the movie was painfully boring the only remotely redeeming aspect was some interesting cinematography 
there s a reason why the director was assassinated i m a firm believer in freedom of speech but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities the product description listed above is completely misleading it s basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims and then at the end they slowly torture them to death pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen 
all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others i know this film has some historical significance being the first british feature length animated film and all but to the modern viewer who has never had the privilege to read orwell s masterpiece this film is a watered down injustice due to the added humor in the story i don t remember anything about a playful baby duck and the tacked on happy ending some other things that i found bothersome were the slow pace and the distracting humming sound read the book instead it s short and won t take you too long mtv will still be there when you get finished 
survivor rip off i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show
